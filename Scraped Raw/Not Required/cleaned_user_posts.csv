all reviews by udeppsdoeswhisky,7,owah1r,body some inevitable questionsnnwhy have you scored things like monkey shoulder 73 and laphroaig quarter cask 90 while youve scored a clearly superior whiskies yamazaki 12 78 are you saying monkey shoulder is almost superior to yamazaki 12 because that would make you an idiotnnit comes down to a change in the scoring system the initial 7 reviews i tried to score based on for this pricepoint how does the whisky taste the idea being to identify the best whiskies for their respective pricepointsnnhowever at the commencement of the 8th review reviews i realised that scoring by pricepoint is ineffective as it doesnt allow for a system that displays my favourite whiskies by rank so the scoring system is now based on enjoyment alone and as a result the scores will be a lot more uniformnnas a result of this the first 7 will get reviewed again at some stage and a revised score will be added to the post theres two exceptions to this the glenlossie carn mor strictly limited 12 was a run of 700 bottles only and as a result i wont be able to find it again its a damn good whisky though and id very readily give it a score of 8590 under the new scoring system secondly ned australian whisky will not be getting a revisit as id rather do a review my own urine than go through that experience againnnkeep an eye out for updated reviews in the future score 6 body im also on instagram deppsdoeswhiskyhttpswwwinstagramcomdeppsdoeswhisky score 1

single paddock whisky harvest 2018 7httpswwwredditcomrwhiskycommentsyd2okb54thwhiskyreview20thaustralianwhiskyreview score 2 body ive had legacy chapter 2 it was pretty good in my book but not as good as the cs ive had batches 5 and 8 of the cs and they were very similar the strongest tasting note was of mocha score 1 body interesting take i find glengoyne to be a nice example of scotch that is inoffensive and what you’d want if you are trying to sit back and relax without thinking too much a easy going experience i was surprised to see you rated the 18 a 54100 and this chapter 3 nas a 67 something seems a little off to be honest about that i personally can’t imagine this chapter 3 being better than the 18 in any regard even if it has 48 but i guess that’s the beauty of all of us having different palates we all have different opinions and that’s ok i’m not trying to be overly critical of you btw i just find it very hard to believe the 18 was as low as you had rated it  which by your metrics says it’s only good for shots i have not had the pleasure of trying the 18 or the chapter 3 since the chapter 3 is 140cdn where i am and i refuse to pay that for a nas unless it’s reviews are glowing  which this chapter doesn’t seem to be average at best if anything and the 18 can be had around here for 180 ish give or take not sure why i have such a problem with this lol i guess it’s my problem haha i just can’t imagine the 18 is that low almost can’t believe it maybe you just don’t like glengoyne and its subtlety i’ve had the 21 once at a wedding and it was a spectacular sherried rich experience so much so i bought a bottle years ago maybe try a sample of the 21 if you enjoy heavily sherried scotch if not i guess just stay away from this distillery that’s just my take anyway cheers score 1 body everyone has mentioned the cs is the best of the batch i’ll have to get my hands on a dram at some stage soon chapter 3 was a fair step up from their standard 12yo and 18yo offerings score 1 body hey thanks for sharing your thoughts i found the 18 didn’t have as much character as the chapter 3 which is why it wasn’t scored as heavily would happily try the 21yo or the cask strength if the chance presents itself as these seem closer to what i’d have liked let me know if you get a cba de to check either out in future keen to hear your thoughts score 2

vanillannfinish oak tanninnnthis whisky came as part of one of those  three bottle miniature christmas packs so it s going to be a treble of glengoyne reviews to get things underway is the the glengoyne 12 which ive never tried before nor any other glengoyne whisky i note its chill filtered which while this isnt a stamp of poor quality usually means the whisky is created to appeal to the masses rather than whisky enthusiasts lets find out nnthe nose is surprisingly ethanol for a 43 abv dram vanilla and spice balance each other well but theres not really much else nnthe palette is soft and uninspiring theres the warm mouthfeel of ethanol and on the first pass no real tasting notes on the second try theres a soft buttery vanilla undercurrent incredibly dull nnthe finish is moderate and warm again with no real notes other than some oak tannin nnwell that was bland glengoyne 12 is what i imagine drinking whisky while having lost your sense of smell to covid would be like if beige was a whisky this would be it theres nothing really of note other than to say if offered a dram while you could drink it neat youd be better off using it as a neutral spirit in a cocktail for 98 there

even if you don’t care for the delicate flavour profile score 3 body glad i stick to my own rules on not buying anything less than 46 and that is chill filterednni saw this in the shop this week and was tempted to try it as i havent had any glengoyne before and wanted another nonpeated malt for my shelf but i bought some arran 10 instead score 0 body it could be that i stumbled upon a xmas special that’s been sitting there for 3 years before it got sold but it just didn’t do it for me i’m usually a big fan of softer and more subtle whisky it just lacked the character that you’d want other reviews on reddit were higher so it may just be an anomaly score 2 body there is some good stuff out there that’s chill filtered under 46 but it’s just that much harder to find how was the aaran 10 score 1 body did you add any water during your tasting out of interest score 1 body i havent tested it yet  originally i was going to last night but that turned into a dram of speyburn 15 and then some corry score 1 body i didn’t score 2 body nice sounds like it may be a friday night dram instead then score 1 body ok opened the arran 10 just for you  figured i would start with that tonight as part of my dram rotationnnnose has faint coconut a bit of apple pear and peach notes also getting a mild floral vanilla reminds me of glenlivet 15 french oak  also a faint lime juice scent  very very faint graham cracker type note too and a faint cinnamonnnafter about 20 mins in the glencairn also now picked up a soft chocolate hazelnut cream note in the backgroundnnmouthfeel itself is medium full  definitely not a watery dram in terms of texture however  slight oily note toonntaste to me is super light at first on the tonguemouth almost airyeffervescent  quickly moves into what i would describe as a young eau de vie note with a bit of young grape sharpness reminiscent of vs cognac  the lime from the smell carries through into the taste  this moves into vanilla and cinnamon  citrus is quite pronounced here definitely limenngetting a nut note taste  whats written on the container is quite true with the hazelnut note  no where near as intense on nut oils that i get from my bunna 12 cs however as it doesnt lastnncoconut is again in the background for taste  have to admit that this is one of the few malts ive had that fully follows the smell profiles into the tastennfinish has again a very light sweetness light coconut lime again and faint nut oiliness that fades on the tongue after a bitnnthis will be nice in my collection as an intro malt like im using it for tonight or for when i want something completely different  i probably wouldnt use it as a daily sipper as it doesnt have enough intensity in the flavor profiles i like but it certainly is a quality malt hands downnni can see why ralfy recommended it for the value and spirit quality  it certainly fills those roles wellnnwould it replace my deanston 12 though  nope score 3 body wasnt a friday night one either lol  last night was three glasses of sazerac rye and more corrynntonight ill open the arran as im done with smokypeppery notes now for a short bit ready to move back to highlandspeyside again  score 2 body thanks for taking the time to review glad to hear the deason 12 has not been unseated 😁 score 2 body nah that deanston 12 is a super quality maltnnwhat was even better than that though tonight was after i was done with the arran i moved onto my bunna 12 2022 cs  now that its sat in the bottle for around two weeks and i have it down to around 65 the flavor tonight was ridiculousnnrich butterscotchtoffee soaked raisinssultanas dusted down with spicy cinnamon and nutmeg with a dry nutty sherry poured over them and some pecanswalnuts and a few candied cherries  the mouthfeel was so thick it would be like if you were eating that combination out of a bowl with a spoon  i had to have two drams it was so goodnni can still taste the sherry nutty finish notes even though i last finished that dram 20 mins ago score 2

distillery ive never heard of and no preconceived notions of whats in storennfirstly whats an str cask you ask good question i had no idea either str casks are casks that have been scraped or shaved toasted and recharred to rejuvenate the cask the idea is to remove the top later of used wood and get to the fresh virgin wood underneath while its not a wildly popular method  a few distilleries use str casks including kavalan penderyn and cotswolds nnthe nose is undeniably bourbon cask and a bit of a difficult one to navigate cola and vanilla are evident and both are underscored with a buttery malt nnthe palete is sweet and delicate softer floral notes are accompanied by an almost artificial sweetness which reminds me of   glenmorangie the original for quite a viscous whisky its surprising to see notes of peaches and behind this a black peppernnthe finish is moderate and sweet maple syrup and vanilla feature prominently before being rounded out with toasted oaknnfor a blind tasting i

wormtub batch 3 is no exception nnfirstly what is a wormtub im glad you asked i had no idea either worm tubs are a type of condenser used as a traditional way of turning spirit vapour back into liquid

whisky doesnt appear to be stocked anywhere in australia if i wanted to purchase a bottle so were delving into a bit of a rabbit hole herennthe nose is quite robust and discernible from three feet away sherry sherry and more sherry is made up of plum dates baking spice dark chocolate and fruitcakennthe palette is quite syrupy and intense as a result of being underscored by rye and what according to google is punchy cassia which is the first time ive encountered it as a tasting note no apologies are offered instead you have to get behind this to enjoy the delightfully unique

peelnnpalate golden syrup orange peel black pepper vanilla ice creamnnfinish spices clovenni picked up a bottle of cotswolds sherry cask single malt whisky at  the whisky lists melbourne event in august as the distillery was a surprise highlight of the day this means that the following review is  biased as i already know its a damn good whisky nnthe nose is undeniably sherry but with a warm glow about it brown sugar and an alcohol soaked christmas cake complement one another well while a soft ginger and slight notes of burn orange peel sit at the end to give it an extra little bit of oomph nnthe palette is viscous warm and has an initial kick to it no doubt due to it being a no age statement and a healthy 574 abv this settles nicely and opens up to reveal a heavy golden syrup thats offset by orange peel black pepper and a soft vanilla ice creamnnthe finish is long warm and hearty composed entirely of spices and clove the finish is probably the one aspect that takes away from the experience nnas i mentioned at the top i really like this whisky the combination of so many casks rarely goes well in this case theyve landed a winner the only aspect that its wonderful is the finish being a bit of a non event well worth trying as a dram or buying a bottle to explore nnwould i buy this to open in 10 years time nnabsolutely yesnnwould i give this as a gift to a fellow

all  not that i expected it to be ofc or else id havent tried any but i have yet to bump into any higher abv from theirs hopefully theres this bottle at the next milano whisky festival the next week score 2 body had a single cask oloroso from them recently and it’s fantastic  great review score 2 body did you add any water to open it up score 1 body have also had a bottle of this and came to near the same conclusion its a very decent sherried one of the better ones in the sub £100 bracket score 1 body i absolutely love their founders choice  ill have to look for this thanks score 1 body fingers crossed you get a chance to try some of the higher abv offerings the milano whisky festival sounds amazing score 3 body not for this review but i have done previously it doesnt seem to add a lot in terms of character unfortunately score 3 body its an oddly wonderful mix of not being a strictly traditional sherry profile but being sherried enough score 3 body haven’t tried the founders choice what makes it enjoyable score 1 body there are better festivals around the eu live in paris leiden limburg where i should attempt to go and even others but mwf is really close by so its absolutely brainless and its the biggest we have in italy nnto be honest i havent followed cotswold i was kind of surprised to see a cs already good to know xd score 1 body loved some unique flavors i havent found in others namely peach and apricot  then it had some traditional breadiness and some gingerbread too   definitely masks its youth  drinks much older than it is  score 1 body very jealous let me know if you uncover any hidden gems whilst at mwf always on the hunt for something new to try score 2 body agreed it drinks much older than it is interesting that you had some different notes in there will see if i can pick up on them when i polish the rest off score 2 body the expectations are on the low side prices are becoming close to unbearable especially ib side so the hunt will be more like a game of chiseling score 2

only fair that it eventually gets reviewed as part of the surplus bottle storage taxnnchivas regal whisky is generally known for appearing in clubs and bars where its more often used as a mixer than as a standalone whisky while the chivas regal 12 has no doubt found its way into many scotch and cokes over the years id yet to try the chivas 18 nnthe nose is light and brings forth marmalade with hints of dried fruit and toffeennthe palette is soft and velvety winter spices add the smallest bit of imagination to what is otherwise more marmaladennthe finish is moderate drops away quite quickly initially quite syrupy an unexpected hint of peat materialises before quickly fading into obscurity nnto put it bluntly this whisky is a mixer rather than a standalone while some scotch blend mixers can get away with being a standalone pour as well ie monkey shoulder chivas does its best work when its accompanied by other components in a cocktail not one id buy again unless i after a very specific taste in my cocktails but my bartending skills arent good enough that id need the chivas 18 over the chivas 12nnwould i buy this to open in 10 years time nnno its not a repeat whiskynnwould i

get downvoted for your opinions but i agree with younni actually bought this waaay back thinking “well its a high age statement may as well splurge” and it did put me off whisky for a good part of the yearnnfor this money you can definitely buy way better  more interesting whisky score 1 body are you sure this hasnt been chill filtered i dont see that statement anywhere else score 1 body this is true score 1 body the jw 18 is much much better than the chivas i actually prefer the jw 18 to blue label as well score 2 body good pickup for it being a blended scotch rather than blended malt amended i could be a bit of an outlier for this one it just really didnt resonate with me but others have scored it fairly well score 2 body there is no way this bottle would “put people off whisky” either the bottle wasn’t stored properly or you have a bias against mass produced blended whisky to my taste this is on par or even better than some entry level 40 abv single malts ex glen grant 10 score 11 body while i agree that it loses in direct competition with a decent single malt i would not say that it discourages newbies from scotch for me it has the classic or standard scotch profile a little bit thin and unexciting but also without any flaws or rough edges therefore i would rate it somewhere between your 44 and the other example of 88 probably in the high 70s score 9 body ouch getting downvoted just because people disagree with your take i appreciate the forthrightness  ive never had the 18 but there was little chance id pick it up before this review and even less after cheers score 1 body its definitely the most polarising review so far it just didnt do it for me but seems to be a crowd favourite its well priced for an 18 but it also lacks the depth and complexity youd want from an 18 agreed there is better younger whisky out there for the price point score 1 body i usually look for a couple of references when figuring out if something is chill filtered or not for this one it was 33 references advising its non chill filterednnsource

the blue label but thats just based on drinking out of 2 minisnnso far i prefer the dewars 18 over the jw18 score 1 body i think it is very unworthy bought twice but never again score 1 body agreed for 75 in my area it’s one of the easiestentry level higheragestatement scotches even if it were blended i’d recommend it to relatively new scotch drinkers or people who prefer to sip on something that isn’t overwhelming complex it tastes great and i still would drink it even after having dozens of cs stuff over the past few years score 2 body good point i probably should have worded that slightly better score 0 body if you were a newbie and ordered it at a bar it wouldn’t be offputting it is lacking any real depth or distinguishing character though score 1 body the good thing about whisky is theres a lot of different and varied opinions seeing a lot of pushback on this one makes me think maybe i need to try it again from a different bottle it could be that the one i reviewed differed to the norm for whatever reason score 2 body maybe someday i might ive bought a bottle of royal salute 21 and chivas regal 25 and thought both were amazing never had the 18 though guessing its no where near as good though im guessing id drink it neat or maybe 1 or 2 rock and be fine but doubt id pick it over my good 18s i have now like oban talisker or glenlivet score 1 body yeah thats the thing it might be an 18 but an arran 10 destroys it or a nas kilchomannnand yeah crowd pleaser for sure its aimed for that great for its purpose but i dont think any whiskyhead would ever spend money on thisnnstill if you’ve got it as a gift you can have it as a “nice whisky to non whisky drinkers” and theyll probably love it  good for cocktails too i’d imagine score 1 body this should be a good reminder that filtering isnt a monolithic thing there are apparently a half dozen levels to filtering with chill filteration just being one among themnnthis should definitely be filtered just not chill filtered score 1 body ive only tried the dewars 15 which i liked theres a place in ca that has the 18 for 50 which is the lowest price ive seen for 18 ill pick up a bottle whenever i make it down there im also curious about duncan taylor 18 but not sure if its worth 75 since i can get buchanans 18 for 75 score 1 body youve hit the nail on the head a crowd pleaser for not big whisky

single paddock whisky harvest 2018 7httpswwwredditcomrwhiskycommentsyd2okb54thwhiskyreview20thaustralianwhiskyreview score 15 body welcome another great reviewnni gotta say though i wouldn’t pair most any whisky with sweet desserts only because whisky in comparison would not taste sweet and taste embittered instead nni might call bourbon as the dessert whiskey in all of whiskydom maybe not taking anything away from your post i still love reviews and the discussion it’ll bring score 9 body hi and welcome to the bourbon world are you from australia or an overseas location that has 80proof bt exports i highly recommend getting the 90proof version — there are some available via local club store picks to really give this whiskey a fair shake many will tell you it’s thin enough as it is and the 80proof version kicks it when it’s down in any case nice first review and come back soon score 7 body a nonchill filtered 80proof bt interesting score 3 body never heard of 80 proof bt score 3 body i love that stuff lol price is starting to creep up unfortunately making it a little less undesirable for me score 2 body i would love to get this but prices near me are all still crazy inflated 50 to 70 a bottle score 1 body never understood how you guys put shit like star anise toffee fucking apple and “sweet oak” in the taste have you licked an oak tree have you actually eaten and digested a bite of an oak tree have you had an apple covered in toffee for fucks sake just say it tastes like whiskey with maybe some sweet vanillafruitiness score 6 body still pretty new to bourbon and my sam’s club has loads of bt…1l bottles for 23 so i picked one up was pretty disappointed with my first glass maybe that will change as my palate becomes more refined at least i hope it does score 1 body 77 is a pretty high score for something you wouldnt want to buy again im personal tastes didnt care for it too much  didnt have enough flavor  tasted watered down compared to tasteful bourbons score 1 body wow … that’s beyond good lol score 1 body removed score 1 body hey another balvenie 17 doublewood fannnit’s a real shame they discontinued it i have two or three bottles stashed score 1 body thanks for the warm welcome i am indeed from australia which has 80proof 40 abv bt exports will definitely give the 90proof a crack if i can find it the thing lacking to really take it up that extra notch was the extra bit of kick that youd hope for from a bourbon score 6 body it’s an export version for the australian market score 2 body price creep hitting a lot of favourites recently glendronach 12 talisker 10 etc have all been bumped up quite a bit of late score 2 body i’m fortunate to live within a couple hours of buffalo trace so i can hit them up directly and get a bottle for 30 when i need more nnbut yes all of their stuff is like double the price vs what’s in their gift shop score 2 body im in tx and the prices are all over i have one little store near me that always has it on sale for 2599 and i always buy it for my dad because he sees prices like you mentioned nn4050 is the normal prices for around me though nnthat same store also sells weller green for 29 and ive seen that up to 99 a bottle in the same area just last week its crazy score 2 body nhearing this makes me feel lucky the liquor store down the road from me always has buffalo trace in stock and its never over 30 score 2 body it’s 2999 here i like it for what it is score 1 body you know what i agree with you i’m new to whiskey for about a little over a year now and it’s like where are these people getting all these different flavors from but it all depends on palette and eventually i’ll be able to discern more flavors the more i get accustomed to it…right score 2 body there are some reviews on here you could make this argument for this one is very brief and has pretty tame tasting notes some peoples palates are a bit more advanced so it is possible that they will pick up more delicate notes and hints of flavors vs yourself on the same pour youre just coming off as a bit of a prick honestly score 5 body it’s always worth revisiting a whiskey in the future where possible to compare notes with a previous tasting score 2 body agreed score 1 body wait they discontinued it i need to grab a  couple of bottles asap if that’s the case score 1 body cheers i spend lots of time in aus a few local 90proof picks floating around not everywhere and not cheap but worth the upgrade to get the real deal score 5 body imo its a huge difference between 80 and 90 proof where i live the 07l bottle is 40  and the 1l bottle is 45 score 1 body does the australian government limit the proof of liquor score 2 body yeah i love it but i find myself grabbing elijah craig more often now because of price point score 1 body i have been finding col taylor small batch for around 80 though  which i think is the best it’s gonna get so at least i have a couple bottles of that score 2 body me too  i was shocked to get a bottle for 27 in the gift shop  then 2 days later i found it at my local walmart for 25  i picked up 2 more  ni will say i do notice the liquor stores are charging more for it score 1 body yeah im in delaware right next to the maryland line and 50 is the lowest ive seen its nuts score 1 body my point was to come off as a prick don’t say you taste “sweet oak” without pouring maple syrup on a piece of oak tree and eating that piece of syruped oak it’s logical sense score 3 body the 17 only they still make the 12 and 21 score 1 body yeah ive noticed whiskey thats 40 abv isnt aiming to offer anything robust as its essentially for the mass market very keen to try to 45 at some stage to see it come into its own a bit more score 4 body needs to be at least 40 abv 80 proof to be classified as whiskey anything less than 40 abv is classified as a liqueur instead nnit’s essentially buffalo trace giving us the cheapest most watered down version of their whiskey that they could legally get away with score 3 body nice i did find a bottle of eagle rare for 70 last week in a liquor store in harrodsburg ky and a bottle of willets score 1 body 45 for small batch at the distillery  couldn’t believe it was so cheap score 1 body last week i was able to get two bottles of blantons from the gift shop 😆 score 1 body keep an eye on rplcb and pop over to pa on truck days for the fine wine and good spirits stores msrp buffalo trace but it goesvery fast they usually get eagle rare and blantons on the same deliveries and those are msrp as well people post when bottles start popping into stores but its very hectic score 1 body maturation in oak casks means a whisky will generally take on an oak note on the palette which is pretty easy to spot when drinking a whisky what would you then call that particular flavour that’s embodied in whisky matured in oak casks if it’s not oak tannin is another that’s plainly evident in certain whiskies but is hard to nail down until you know that’s what it is score 5 body how about you stop being a prick and let people share how they experience their whiskey tasting notes are not real is a tired take  you believe what you want to believe but it doesnt give you the license to shit on people who describe their whiskey differently from you score 6 body i’ll have to sniff out some 17 to squirrel away then the 12 is good haven’t tried the 21 before score 1 body youve inspired me to track down the 17 unfortunately its now exorbitantly priced au400us250 in australianz for a bottle however i was able to buy half a dozen 50ml sample bottles at a reasonable price along with the added bonus of then half a dozen 50ml balvenie 12 and balvenie 14 caribbean cask bottles as well to go with it thanks for the heads up score 1 body yeah that’s getting expensive also  i have one bottle left i refuse to open lol score 1 body how do you personally perceive that oak taste how would you describe it score 2 body glad you were at least able to find the minis the 21 is very good but also very expensive the 17 was real value which made me sad when they axed it score 1 body ‘woody’ is the best way to describe for me but it means having the noticeable sweet spices vanillacinnamonnutmeg type flavour to it which is unique to whisky made in oak casks nnit’s same way burning wood such as sandalwood or pine has its own distinct and noticeable aroma just in this case it’s a unique taste rather than a unique smell virgin oak is a lot more noticeable for this woody note than second fill casks nnthe easiest way to nail down what it tastes like is by trying two whiskies one that has quite pronounced oak and one that doesn’t having the comparison allows you to see specifically what tastes different score 2 body my local liquor store manager is some sort of a certified bourbon sommelier and has a kit full of essences and tasting notes  this gives her the point of reference for some of these obscure flavors score 1

single paddock whisky harvest 2018 7httpswwwredditcomrwhiskycommentsyd2okb54thwhiskyreview20thaustralianwhiskyreview score 2 body this used to be a good whiskey unfortunately the quality went downhill when they started using their own juice nim actually a bit worried for them and the future obviously more maturity will come with time but there seems to be something amiss with their spirit and core casks they use hopefully that might just be the age thingnnthe only current whiskey that i enjoy from them are the blackpitts peated releases score 1 body a few funny comments here the own juice statement is hilarious given they won best pot still last year and age statement in general is a farce there are young whiskeys that will blow a 18yr old out of the water especially given if that 18 was only ever in 4th fill bourbon casks or the fact 18 or 21 means nothing but gifting for those people now legally allowed to drink small batch is an overused term sure but the fact they remake it every couple years is a good indication of a commitment to growth taste this vs their 4 other rum finishes to showcase different rum influences finally taste it against jameson or tully as a entry level flagship obviously i think its great but thats my opinion not saying its is right or wrong but theres no such thing as a bad whiskey if someone enjoys it score 1 body agreed the small batch is not good im more excited for the single malt which is up next has been recommended by a couple of friends score 1 body yep agrees seems like an age thing as it tastes extremely young and immature nas is never going to set the world on fire but it seems theyre hitting the bare minimum and shipping it as is rather than curating something enjoyable for the price point score 0 body theres certainly worse out there its just not one i enjoyed if you enjoy it and feel it represents value for money then its a win for your collection score 1 body looking forward to hearing about that one score 3

great whisky score 7 body i always keep it stocked i like it more than the special releases good review score 4 body was always my favorite but the price has gone up so much in the past few years here in the us that i will likely never buy this again it makes me sad when i think of it but i cant bring myself to pay what diageo is asking score 5 body lagavulin 16 near me has spiked up to about 120 usdnnwhat alternatives do i have in the 6080 rangennwhat i likenn ardbeg 10n laphroaig 10  quarter caskn talisker 10  storm score 4 body its a great whisky but it suffers from the low abv and at the moment is really really expensive where i live to the point that i wouldnt buy another bottle score 5 body its my favourite whisky before i tried it i had glenmorangie 18 as my favorite but holy shit this is intense nnron swanson was right it is the nectar of the gods score 2 body it is chill filtered score 3 body its nice but for the price in particular after recent hikes there is a lot of competition it probably should be at least 46 at its current price point for less money i can get machir bay cs for example which rivals cask strength lag 12 let alone the 16 score 2 body staple islay scotch nstill one of my top3 favourite whiskies i really don’t understand why the numerous whisky snobs beat on it that much  i agree that it should be a bit higher abv but pricewise you can grab one around 60 € if you keep an open eye tell me an other 16yo islay that you can get in the same price range i would be more than hogy to hear score 1 body  score 1 body  score 1 body i know it is not

realize it wasn’t i should read better egads lagavulin is the stuff my friend enjoy score 1 body also grabbed a bottle last christmas on sale at a german supermarket one of my favorites but i refuse to pay 80 for something i bought for years at 4550 score 0 body ledaig 10 is a good bet score 3 body kilchoman for sure both sanaig or machir bay are reasonable and quite good score 3 body while its obviously different i consider talisker 10 to be like a poor mans lagavulin for while its not as peaty it has a very similar maritime note that feels like salty sea spray and i love it score 2 body talisker 10 is a staple for any whisky cabinet the laphroaig quarter cask is one of my favourite islay whiskys for the wonderful blended notes score 2 body idk if it’s gonna be available in your area at this price but port charlotte heavily peated is about 72 for a bottle at my total wine stores my favorite smokey scotch bounces back and forth between that and lagavulin 16 so i’d always recommend it as an alternative score 1 body kilchoman machir bay score 1 body 77 usd at the costco local to me score 3 body agreed its one for on sale purchases rather than full price its jumped up quite a bit since covid score 2 body hes righthttpsimagizerimageshackcomaimg9038371ycehpagif score 1 body youre spot on edited score 2 body ll score 1 body youre right its an outrage i plan on visiting more islay whiskies once ive got through the current backlog score 2 body i thought the same but to be fair my rating might also vary widely now vs at earlier stage of my whisky drinking journey still one of my favs and my memorable intro to islay would love to keep a bottle at all times but just can’t justify the price right now score 1 body i can assure you the grand architect had no role to play in this

peppery hint of spicenn23rd street distillery is located in renmark population 4634 and 250km northwest of adelaide to say it’s an unusual location for a distillery would be an understatement but 23rd street distillery don’t stop there with their unusual approach nnrather than produce their own whiskey 23rd street have instead opted to purchase barrels of unnamed 5 year old scotch and 2 year old bourbon and then blend them together in their on site bourbon casks for a longer duration it’s a textbook play out of the japanese ‘world whisky’ model except japanese distilleries are doing it due to a huge demand for their product rather than whatever 23rd street’s idea behind this is in the interests of disclosure i tried 23rd street distillery hybrid whiskey about four years ago and didn’t really enjoy it with that said let’s give it another whirlnnthe nose is incredibly light and has an initial smell of alcohol which is surprising given the 423 abv once your nose gets past this there’s light notes of vanilla and sherry nnthe palette is sparingly thin with domestic honey and caramel the two main evident notes behind these brown sugar makes an appearancennthe finish is surpassingly long and unsurprisingly delicate peppery with a hint of spice but not offering anything overly complex nnoverall hybrid whiskey isn’t great and seems to be the worst of both casks as it lacks the complexity of a scotch and the robustness of a bourbon as much as i dislike the whole idea of japanese ‘world’ whisky it would be preferable to this aussie variationnnnwould i buy this to open in 10

single paddock whisky harvest 2018 7httpswwwredditcomrwhiskycommentsyd2okb54thwhiskyreview20thaustralianwhiskyreview score 3 body man youre on a roll lately with these horrible aussie whiskies score 1 body damn thats quite sad to read ive always been a huge fan of this bottle and have had at least one on hand for 2 years i found it was a little more complex than you described with lots of toffee and banana notes on the palate nni did find however the quality dropped once they stopped putting the bottle numbers on them i think youd be extremely lucky to find one of those nownni feel to also mention that renmark actually isnt such a surprising place to have a whiskey distillery the area is a fairly well known wine region in australia as well as being a few hundred kilometres from the coonawarra wine region located along the same border score 3 body thanks for the review the description didn’t sound compelling and neither does your review will happily give this a miss nnfor what it’s worth i tried a single malt from them a few months ago at a small sa distillery show and it was decent can’t give any kind of worthwhile review as i was about 10 or 12 in by that point but it was better than some others there basic but reasonably well rounded i thought score 1 body thankfully that’s the last of them plenty of internationals coming up 😊 score 2 body i suspect my offering was from the non numbered bottle then or it could just be the case that when it’s sitting in a small 50ml glass jar for 18 months it loses a bit of its depth didn’t realise renmark was also inaround a wine region as well will have to put it in the list of places to visit have been to barossa and mclaren vale which were both excellent score 2 body i haven’t tried any of their locally produced whisky but by all accounts it sounds better than the imported blend offering score 1 body i can recommend visiting a distillery called fleurieu distillery in goolwa sa amazing whiskeys relatively affordable for mostly one off runs i think i tried a flight of about 4 or 5 a few years back couldnt fault any so i still rave about them to now score 3 body added to the list thanks friend score 2

before realising you hadn’t reviewed it yet yeah me either for readers who haven’t read my previous reviewshttpswwwredditcomrdeppsdoeswhiskycommentsowah1rallreviewsbyudeppsdoeswhisky starward is my local distillery and i’ve reviewed most of their releases from the last couple of years as well as spending plenty of time there with friends i also really rated their original tawny release however didn’t review it now the conflicts of interest are out of way let’s get into the reviewnnthe starward tawny 2 is quite enjoyable on the nose though it’s not overly complex dried fruit immediately grabs your attention and orange isn’t far behind toasted oak is also evident when you explore further overall the nose is the equivalent to sticking your nose into a bowl of dried fruit that’s been given a quick soak in tawny wine before it gets thrown into a christmas pudding nnthe palate is initially surprisingly sweet before that’s quickly kicked aside by the robustness i’ve come to expect from a starward whisky the initial sweetness is a welcome change no doubt due to the longer maturation process while it lacks any complexity and real depth it is still quite rewarding with dried fruit and nutmeg featuring prominently with lighter notes of brown sugar evident with a bit of exploration nnthe finish is long and well balanced the spice leaves a warm and pleasant feel well after you’ve finished and sits on the tongue for quite some time with an enjoyable mouthfeel nnfirstly the big difference from almost all other starward whiskies is the sweeter notes that present in tawny 2 this is no doubt due to it being aged 7 years while most starward whisky is bottled at a 34 year range and as such is quite robust and punchy this more mature product is no doubt due to the change in location in 2016 which allowed them to expand their production and rely less on quicker turnover of product and it bodes well for the future nnoverall tawny 2 is an ideal winter whisky and one of my favourites to date from starward distillery nnnwould i buy this to open in 10 years time nnpossibly if i had the cupboard space and wanted to compare it to the inevitable tawny 3nnwould i give this as

they had some older examples but i know aging in australia can be difficult because of the hot climates score 1 body the ginger beer casks have been a lot of fun to explore each year hopefully we’ll see more aged whisky in the future but as you say the climate isn’t conducive towards long term maturation score 2 body i wonder if they could set up an aging facility in the coldest part of australia hobart tasmania has a mean temperature of 48 to 72 f yearround which is just about 8 degrees warmer compared to scotland im sure the thought has crossed their mind score 1 body it may be possible to do a barrel swap with a tassie based distillery but they’d definitely be the exception rather than the norm to have a portion of their barrels stored interstate interesting idea though score 1

fruitnnpalate wild honey wood spices vanilla cayenne peppernnfinish long and lingering dried lemon gives way to late peat and malt nnfor whisky review number 50 i figured it best to go with something a little atypical and starward maple syrup cask definitely fits the bill this whisky isn’t commercially available instead to obtain a 200ml bottle you need to refer a new member to signup to the whisky club an australian based whisky provider naturally it just so happened that my brother was available to sign up and so i’ve been lucky enough to end up with two bottles to sample of this unique whisky nnthe second point of difference is with a lack of availability comes a lack of tasting notes from other reviewers so i’m doing this one totally blind in that there’s nothing to cross check or compare notes with before publishing my review let’s get into itnnthe nose is initially sharp ethanol with a sweeter undertone that eventually reveals itself to be a mixture of orange and dried fruitnnthe palate is moderate to robust with very almost no complexity an initial sweetness gives way to mixed peel and a very syrupy honey combine without being overly engaging or interesting even my tried and true method of holding that mouth feel for a while to see what presents itself yields no extra informationnnthe finish is warm and moderate finishing on an unexpected pleasantly sweet note again it’s quite muted as orange and fruit mince pie are there but not at the forefront nni can see why this whisky wasn’t commercially released by starward and instead handed off to use as a signup bonus by the whisky club starward have had a crack at a few different unique bottling of late dolche hungarian oak mesquite smoked malt which have all offered their own unique points of difference in this sense the starward maple syrup cask is no different only that it’s unique point of difference is that it’s a failure and would do the brand some damage if they tried to convince people this is a good whisky with that said the important bit here is they took a risk and tried something new even if it didn’t work out and the eventual output was unsellable nnwould i buy this to open in 10 years

and im not a starward fan nni find the balance between the orange peel bitterness and the maple sweetness to be a nice compliment  nnx200bnnid comfortably double up on this if it was available score 2 body slam it score 1 body this review reads like a lot of the reviews i read for the ginger beer cask which i loved nnhave to say the idea of this appeals a lot less still a lot of their risks have paid off and its nice for us to see them progress through the different ideasnnthanks for the write up i had no idea this existed until today score 1 body love starward their ginger beer casks are one of my favourites score 1 body starward makes some yummy stuff this one sounds like a miss  though i wonder if its that maple syrup  whiskey dont mix or that they used their worst barrels on this in an attempt to salvage bad base whiskey cant be finished away score 1 body i dont understand why they would make this at least in canada we have a ton of maple syrup but does australia have lots too score 6 body i agree with your admiration for them willing to try bold things that might not pan out but it’s kinda funny for the whisky club to greet new members with a bottle of absolute swill on signup incredible strategy score 1 body hi udeppsdoeswhiskynnthanks for the review on this starward very unfortunate it was not good but then again maybe thats why the world hasnt seen very many maple cask finished whiskies  thanks again score 1 body interesting that we had similar thoughts the only divergence being i found the sweetness was far too overbearing they’re also currently offering a honeycomb whisky which may be to your taste score 1 body which was your favourite of the ginger beer casks ginger beer 5 cask i quite enjoyed the 6 less so 7 is somewhere in between the two its good that theyre prepared to experiment and try new things though even if it doesnt always succeed score 2 body they must have got a cheap lead on the casks sounds like they figured out it doesnt work score 3 body youd be surprised theyve started growing maples around the snowfields in victoria and im starting to see local producers on the shelves in my upmarket supermarket i found a website which says thatnnthe quantity of maple syrup exported by australia in 2020 was 1107 tons in 2019 australia shipped 5092 tonnes of maple syrup for the year 2019 alone the interest in australia maple syrup processed category has escalated recording a change of 387739 per cent compared to the year 2018 between 2017 and 2019 maple syrups exports went up by 1050833 percent bringing australia us031m for the year 2019 score 2 body much less so in australia but the distillery are trying a few weird and whacky combinations of casks to see how it goes its the only maple syrup finished whisky ive come across to date score 2 body its a bit contradictory surely youd go with 50ml of something much higher up the shelf instead score 1 body youre spot on they took a risk and it didnt work out thats not to say it was a failure only that it wasnt a success score 2 body ive only just had a chance to try batch 6 batch 5 was already long gone i reckon the place i tried the 6 will get the 7 eventually  so well have to wait and seennid heard that people had enjoyed the 6 over the 5 but it s just internet chatter so ive not put too much into thatnnits good that theyre prepared to experiment and try new things though even if it doesnt always succeednnstrongly agree score 2 body i could have sent them a few samples of canuck whisky that tried similar and saved them some money score 3 body holy damn  well

exclusive cask collection whiskies alongside the select cask and vintage cask glenfiddich predominantly position themselves in the low and lowmiddle end of the whisky market with whisky that aims to appeal to the masses rather than the enthusiast side note i’m surprised it’s taken me 49 previous reviews to reach a glenfiddich as my first introduction into single malt whisky was a glenfiddich 12 nnthis whisky was thoughtfully purchased by a friend for us to explore together at 40 abv and coloured with the dreaded e150 caramel colouring my expectations going into this whisky were quite low nnthe nose offers christmas spice oak and citrus though it is somewhat muted and not as enticing as it would otherwise be at a higher abv nnthe palette is incredibly velvet smooth and contains a surprising amount of depth malted grain vanilla and caramel all feature prominently and jostle for position behind that oak and dark chocolate notes can be found although these require a little bit of exploration this is rounded out by a subtle yet distinct taste of anise  nnthe finish is long and bold which again is a surprise given the abv cloves citrus oak and vanilla are all present and the finish is warm and enticing  nngoing into it with such low expectations i’ve got to say the glenfiddich reserve cask has outperformed my expectations i can see why they’ve tried to position this whisky with the unique selling point of being a travel whisky as they’ve already got a wide selection of aged and nas whiskies available through retail outlets nnthe 200ml bottle is about the right size to check it out for the 700ml bottle there’s better whiskies at that price point and it starts to enter into the conscious decision category as asides to the post holiday impulse purchase if you’re in the market for something that looks unappealing on the surface but offers a surprising amount of depth you could do worse than glenfiddich reserve casknnwould i buy this to open in 10 years

wasnt just me i had a drinks package on holiday and made my way through all the whiskies on the list i have to say i was disappointed with this one im awful at describing it but my problem with it was that it didnt seem to have a middle it had nose the start of a taste then a bit of nothing then the finale i expected much better at the price score 1 body i’m not surprised you took this long to sample another glenfiddich the 12 was actually the last of the big brands for me and one of the most expensive it is also definitely the worst so it’s basically last on my list too score 1 body would

mouth light orchard fruit makes a fleeting appearance as wellnnthe finish is long warm and peppery designed for braving the cold winters and stiff north atlantic breeze the very end of the sensation delivers a hint of caramelised sugar as well nnit’s been a while since i’ve had a talisker and i’m glad there was some time between outings to allow for the review to be as nonbiased as possible there is no doubt that talisker 10 punches well above its price point in terms of character enjoyment and depth which is why it’s almost always found in any reasonable bar a cracking dram nnwould i buy this

white rye 30httpswwwredditcomrworldwhiskycommentsowaatj35thwhiskyreview8thaustralianwhiskyreview score 2 body its definitely a beginner islay i took a couple of bottles during the recent tescos promo along with a skye i still have 34 of the second bottle left and every time i come to the peat shelf its not the one i think of having its a bit light on complexity a bit light on the peat its got the slight spicy saltiness we expect from a maritime but overall its not an expression i feel enthusiastic about as a daily drinker and its certainly not a keepernni have the 18 on my try list but im not hurrying will likely be a show tasting if i cant find someonea bar with an open bottle score 0 body its great as an everyday drinkernnfor those in ireland its on offer at €30 in tesco at the moment so stock up in advance of the new years minimum alcohol pricing coming in score 1 body i think its my favorite easy to find scotch kiln embers has been the only one ive enjoyed more than talisker score 1 body sweet glass score 1 body important to make that distinction between islay and the isle of skye really skye belongs to a grouping of islands known as the ‘inner hebrides’ the region is referred to as ‘the highlands’ by the local authority council but is generally referred to as ‘the highlands and islands’ as this is one of scotland’s 8 electoral regions talisker is actually the only single malt currently distilled on skye however that is set to change with the torabhaig  distillery recently being set up on the sleat peninsula  looking forward to tasting this one when it’s ready there is also a recently completed distillery on the island of raasay accessed from skyennas for talisker it has notes of peat and sea salt to it owing to the western location and proximity to the sea loch harport it’s not the peatiest of the western whiskies lagavuilin being the most medicinal with lagavuilin and caol isla not far behind but still packs a punch which is softened with a wee drop of water to open it upnnpersonally i prefer it with a very wee drop of water score 2 body good spot thanks for the til and i have amended the review accordingly score 2 body agreed its at the beginner end of the peated offerings as someone whos not big into peat its well suited for my palate score 2 body just to correct some of thisnntalisker falls under the islands whiskiesntalisker is medium peated around 14ppm on average islay being around 3040ppmnskye is and is classed as an island but falls into the highlands council regionntòrabhaig has been open for over 3 years nownraasay has been open for just over 4 both have releasesnnsource  live on skye worked at talisker love whisky score 1 body thanks for the extra detail regarding the ppm for peat  very interesting… not sure what you’re correcting though  you literally backed up everything else i said 😂  one point i didn’t make clear was although there are releases at these other distilleries they are legacy releases and not fully matured malts i actually just picked up the latest raasay which is very nice indeed…nnalso meant to say laphroig was a peaty demon score 1

cask finish the nose is quite robust and inviting with strong notes of port wine plum and leather although not as delicate or nuanced as other archie rose offerings you’re more than willing to trade this for the wonderfully warm and inviting nose plum also comes through on the second or third revisit nnthe palette is quite syrupy and your mind immediately goes to a rich and inviting flavour of stewed plums figs dates and port wine when the initial kick wears off a bitter chocolate and slightly sweeter coca reveal themselves the palette is much like the carn morhttpswwwredditcomrwhiskycommentsgwcmps1stwhiskyreview1stscotchreviewglenlossie bottle that was my first ever review one that lends itself to cold nights by a fireplace and keeps you feeling warm and toasty nnthe finish is that of campfire smoke which is no doubt due to peated malt appearing on the mash bill alongside pale malt amber caramel atomic roasted and chocolate malts nnstrap yourself in because this review is more philosophical than usual over the last couple of years i’ve really come to appreciate the drop day for a rare or obscure whisky which as the market demand picks up are becoming harder to obtain the archie rose whisky in every port was one of those offerings with only 577 bottles in existence and a preregistration required and purchasers to be selected via ballot nni registered and was offered a bottle and my best friend also registered but missed out i’m a firm believer in whiskies which as this being saved for a special occasion as the rarity of it means it should be saved for a rare occasion such as a wedding funeral winning the wsop or in this occasion a pregnancy announcement some bottles are purchased with a milestone in mind others are saved for an unexpected announcement or achievement my friend who missed out visited on the weekend and dropped the news that he and his partner are expecting their first child which warrants opening a special bottle and a whisky in every port ticked the box perfectly in living up to the expectations nnin short this whisky is bloody good but part of that may be the fact that i’m unlikely to ever try it again and it is now forever associated with a joyful celebration with a much loved friend to me that’s how whisky is meant to be enjoyed good company good whisky good conversation and good memories and if you’re able to forever tie a certain whisky to a certain event then that’s a damn fine way to do it in my opinionnnwould i buy this to open in 10 years time nnyes if i can get my hands on

does this stuff exist is it cheap score 1 body yeah this stuff is not great released early on so they could get a bit of cash flow through the business but it fell very short was super excited to try it as i live only about 15 minutes from the distillery but this was a disappointment got a bottle of their single malt last year and it made up for it though definitely worth a review if you can get your hands on some score 1 body nice to see ratings that aren’t in practice 75100 thanks  score 6 body haha that about sums it up perfectly score 3 body as it doesnt need to age it allows a whisky distillery to start selling a product in a much shorter timeframe and start generating revenue unfortunately in this instance a bottle is 99 which is only slightly cheaper than their actual whisky which is 120 score 1 body youve summed it up well the single malt is excellent review of it to follow when i get some time score 1 body sounds like an expensive gimmick score 1

american bourbon casks finished in ruby port pipesnnbody mahogany nnnose plum oak berriesnnpalate sweet and thick fruit berries chocolate mousse orangennfinish long and sweet dark chocolate nnthe third of three glenmorangie whisky reviews the glenmorangie quinta ruban is the glenmorangie the original however it’s finished for an additional four years in ruby port pipes from the quintas wine estate in portugal and boy does that make a differencennthe nose is very adventurous with rich notes of plum and oak to enjoy behind this is a more subtle nose of berries which adds a little extra reward for exploring further nnthe palate is bold and adventurous with the undeniable port finish coming through prominently in a sweet thick viscosity fruit and dark berries provide the initial warm and rich mouthfeel while additional complexity gives hints of chocolate mousse and concentrated orange nnthe finish is long lasting and warm best compared to dark cocoa dense chocolate nndefinitely my favourite of the three glenmorangie reviews the original and nectar d’or were the other two as it stands head and shoulders above in terms of complexity depth and overall enjoyment whereas the previous two were sweet and lacking the quinta ruban offers something for everyone in terms of tastes and sensation nngoing behind the curtain to reveal my review strategy i normally do a blind tasting and put my notes down before comparing to other reviews to see if there’s anything i may have missed or anything i picked up that they didn’t this is the first review where four different reviewers here  here here and here all gave vastly different tasting notes in terms of what you can expect while i attribute part of this to the 2019 changeover from quinta ruben being a 12 year old to a more mature 14 year old whisky the remainder is simply the port pipe finish offers a variety of subtle and unique tastes that appeal to different reviewers nnwhile it sits behind the glenmorangie signet and the gelnmorangie duthac in my preferences list neither of which have yet been reviewed stay tuned the glenmorangie quinta ruban is a well polished whisky that offers excellent value for money for its price point if you haven’t tried it before and can get it on sale it’s well worth exploring you won’t be disappointed nnwould i buy this to open in 10 years time nnno unless it was being discontinued nnwould i give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast nnyes it would make a great gift nnwould i give this as a gift as an introductory whisky nnyes if they were fans of port or

given it’s currently winter in melbourne and the bottle was almost complete it was time for a review nnthe nose is sweet but a toffee and brown sugar sweet where it’s a little less refined and has a bit more depth to it than say a honey sweetness behind this apples pear and light floral notes add some extra depth and round the nose out wellnnthe palate has a strong initial kick which is to be expected from a 60 cask strength whisky it’s immensely warm with spices pepper and oak initially playing on your palette adding a drop or two of water opens this up quite a bit and allows for the lighter depth of sherry off and stone fruit to shine throughnnthe finish is warm mediumlong and lingering and really warms the cockles with light campfire smoke and stewed fruits competing behind the cask strength robustness nnoverall glenfarclas 105 is to me an underrated whisky that doesn’t get the love it deserves sure the label isn’t sexy and the distillery isn’t currently in vogue but glenfarclas 105 offers some excellent depth a good punch and fits perfectly on the shelf with a post it on it that says ‘best consumed on on a cold night’ a solid whisky that punches above its price

bottling i have yet to get and really want to as i love the high proof bourbons the 10 is ok the 25 is too woody for me while the 15 i have ready as a sample the 105 might be the one for me then again the 15 might be just the right balance too score 1 body i agree that this is underrated this is the dram to have sitting by the fireplace on a cold autumn or winters night after a big roast dinner rich complex sweet and warm i absolutely love it its a sherry cask gem i personally rate closer to 95 score 1 body really nice review   the 105 really opens up with a couple of drops of water from your pipette  give it a try if youve not alreadynnif you like this and the doublewood presumably the 17 year have a crack at the glendronach 18 allerdice  if thats not what youve got already looking

space in his artworks the label on the highland park bottle is ’sforzinda’nnthe bowmore was the final whisky we tried and was my least favourite of the four bottles we were told in advance that this is the most polarising whisky in the collection and one that people tend to be very in favour of or very against unfortunately i fell into the latter camp the best way to describe this whisky is imagine someone prepared a bucket full of hearty beef stew dumped a shovel load of fort william dirt into the bucket and let it sit there for several weeks before draining it and calling the remnants a whisky oh and for some reason someone added a dozen or so jalapeños in there as well just for good measurennwith that said the nose is undeniably engaging offering the most complex nose i’ve ever come across the initial nose of jalapeños and is curious yet getting behind these you come across a salty earthy beefy stew that somehow offsets the initial spiciness likely because it’s more robust the palate follows through with warm spices jalapeños salt earthy complexion and a beef stew with more subtle hints of malt when a couple of drops of water is added the nose rounds out this oddity with a surprisingly long peat salt and more beef stock cube nnthe ben navis distillery is apparently unloved being out of the way and a smaller distillery it doesn’t get the love of whisky

work for everyone  the use of brewers yeast and the earthy character can be a huge turn off  nnjalapeno would seem a bit unusual for a ben nevis  it usually simultaneously fruity and earthy  ive gotten an unshakable poblano on a peated bunnahabhain though score 5 body i can see why people would love the earthy characters its just not my thing i can definitely see ben nevis fans scoring this 910 based on the characteristics of the cask the jalapeño was very unusual and not something ive come across in any other whisky before where its spicy on the nose and palette if theres other whiskies out there that have a similar profile without the earthy tones id love to give them a try score 1

score 11 body interesting review nni’ve had blue label once and was thoroughly underwhelmed it was smooth the taste was fine but just fine i’d be just as happy having a suntori toki or glenmorangie 10 it was that kind of smooth and easy drinking score 4 body i love reading your reviews and this back to back of jw was great i felt a little attacked although deserved from your critique of red label your review is spot on but i drink it weekly when i’m alone on a weekday and just wanna taste some whisky it’s a way to fluff my expenses from my nicer whiskys meaning i’m too much of an alcoholic and poor to drink only my nice whiskys nnthanks for doing this 👌🏼 score 2 body i do would love to get a 200ml bottle to try blue label it is high on my list of whiskies to try but i can’t justify the 300 price tag for a 750ml bottle when i’ve never had it before always glad to hear that it is nice though score 2 body im a whisky drinker through and through but had a glass of blue label to celebrate on my honeymoon it was really just to splash out and do something out of the ordinary and while it may not be as developed or nuanced as many single malts far less pricey per pour it was absolutely delicious score 1 body a generally good rule is to not expect too much from blended whiskies they all have a relative sharpness and an unpredictability in regards to flavour doesnt mean theyre bad just not great quality produce score 1 body as a fairly new scotch drinker i love the jw double black costco had a sale 6 off per bottle of you bought two so i ended up getting four bottle for approx 20 each nni also got a green 15 year and quite frankly i am not a fan nni also got the 12 days of tasting 2 mini bottles of six different jw and are looking forward to trying them all blue included  but i’ll print out your review for comparison score 1 body the us43 makes me green label with envy here in thailand the generals mark up imported spirits 30 to 100 nnquestion from a nonjw person me  i found here the special release jw black label islay origin blended malt 1 liter for 1899 baht 63 for perspective a 700 ml of uigeadail here costs us132 should i buy a  spare bottle of the islay origin i do like it at that price to put away while it is still around will it really run out or will they keep making it like lagavulin did with the 8 score 1 body thanks i think it’s important to drink whatever you enjoy and not let public opinion sway your preferences too much one of my daily drinkers is gentleman jack which many would look down on as it’s cheap but it punches well above its price point imo score 3 body 20 a bottle is an absolute steal great buy at that price score 1 body i haven’t tried the islay origin range at all so couldn’t comment on it specifically my general rationale for whisky is if it’s a limited edition and i want to try it at some point i’ll buy a couple of bottles one to try and one to hold onto for later down the line so i’d say if it will make you happy fork out the 1899 baht and enjoy score 2 body haha very interesting i could never drink jack daniels again too much of it in my youth but i respect what you mean we all need our filler whiskys score

body best and most balanced review of blue ever written score 5 body great series of reviews thanks i am not an economist but you have to hand it to diageo who make jw  they have a series of products in the jw range that really do cover everything from inferior goods that we only buy if we can’t afford anything else  all the way through to jw blue  we see it as a luxury gift that doesn’t offend if we receive it nwhat would happen if they doubled the price of it could they create pappy levels of demand and secondary pricing score 2 body what a nice review all full of common sense and stuffnni have to say that many moons ago when i was solely a craft beer geek jwbl was my intro to whiskey a friend came over with a bottle that he had received as a gift from a customer i thought i didnt like scotch but was really pleasantly surprised with how tasty it was i think that soft palate and long finish is what did it i can see why they price it and market it where it is its a superb starter for a beginner score 2 body very nice review i agree with the idea that this whiskey is a celebratory whiskey it might help that this one is the last of the jw range while if youd take something like dalmore a whiskey at that price wouldnt be the last in the lot score 1 body i really appreciate these reviews i had this before and it spot on thank you for ur effort kind sir score 1 body great review and wrap up of the range score 1 body in these parts it’s on the shelves for 250 us everywhere i go price is skyrocketing for some reason even though every store has plenty in stock score 1 body it is kinda overhyped my nonscotchdrinking friend got a bottle for me thinking that it was the best thing around given the price and the fact that people wont shut up about it haha when he handed it to me i went in my head i wish you had told me you were about to drop 200 we could have gotten a way better bottle he himself hadnt ever tried it before and hated it score 10 body getting out of

so many people say its overpriced in switzerland you get it for 139 when you know where to look and for that price i actually do like it score 1 body i think green label is much more delicious score 5 body yeah i agree with you  i found it for 125 no tax very happy with it at that price  its not one of my favorite whiskeys but its pretty good and frankly there is something to be said for being able to pour something for a casual whisky fan that they will find impressive score 4 body thanks score 1 body what would be the craft beer equivalent to johnnie walker blue score 1 body somewhere out there someone has celebrated getting out of prison with a bottle of blue label i guarantee it haha score 3 body the drink society and nicks wine merchants both have it for under 60 a 200ml bottle score 1 body for a 200ml bottle  score 1 body having had both side by side several times i like blue better but green is by far the better value score 1 body its not bad but there are so many more interesting bottles to be had for 125 price cant go down if people keep buying it green label is a much better value for instance score 2 body not sure craft beer is very localized what i have access to here in the vancouver area is pretty different than someone as close as seattle across the bordernbut if youre asking about style i think id give someone used to bud or something worse a nice kolsch imo score 2 body blue moon or goose island ipa fairly ubiquitous and it’s decent without being superb score 2 body sort of depends what you are looking for i guess  green label isnt a better value in terms of pouring something impressive for someone who doesnt have a developed palate  i like to have something on hand for every type of whisky drinker score 2 body green label isn’t as impressive because it costs less doesn’t seem worth is to spend double on a bottle to “impress” snobs score 3 body eh worth it to me but i wouldnt recommend it for the first 50 or so bottles someone

define as the ‘real whiskies in the johnnie walker range ie not mass marketed it’s a whisky aimed at whisky drinkers the green label also stands out from its cheaper cousins by being 43 abv rather than a diluted 40 abvnnthe nose of cut grass isn’t one i’ve come across often in my whisky journey and it sets the precedent for what johnnie walker offers those who stumble into their mid ranger offering of green label with the rest of the nose composed of fresh fruit and vanillannthe palate is rich on oak and fruits that have come straight off the tree with floral notes behind it honey and cinnamon are also present and add a nice bit of depth the surprising aspect is that both the nose and the palate are comparable to other whiskies in the same price range i appreciate australian prices differ from elsewhere and it holds its own quite well in this regard the only criticism would be it lacks complexity however there are many other more expensive whiskies out there that are guilty of this same transgressionnnthe letdown for johnnie walker green is the finish it’s as short as this sentence it doesn’t linger it doesn’t round out the nose and palette in a way that you’d hope it does leaving you a little short in your overall drinking experience nnthe name of green label is appropriate as the tasting experience conjures up images of an orchard garden overall johnnie walker green

that johnnie walker makes score 27 body so i was having this with a friend a week ago neat and he thought it would be good with ice i kinda wanted to hit him in the back of the head but he said it changed the taste and how all the flavors open up so i tried it with ice the box recommends it and it changes a lot for the good score 4 body the underlying salt taste is what takes a lot of enjoyment away from this drink imo it just does not blend in well with other floral or sweet tastes score 3 body just got this one today a definite cut above black label and red label but also us77 total wine  more in my location near seattle wa so definitely a premium price macallan 12 year is only 70 here and a better scotch score 3 body a useful and very timely review since ive been considering this one as a slightlybetter blended expression for my collection the litany of qualified nos seems fairly determined i can get jw double black for 20 less which may be good enough for filling the gap as a mixer most of the compass box range would run me 6070 still not outrageous but im not sure which one to focus on maybe the peat monster score 2 body for blended this is the best considering taste profile and price 3999 at my local costco i have like 3 bottles in my home bar and i keep this stocked all year around also makes a great oldfashioned score 2 body awesome review excited to try this

outdoors score 5 body i completely agree score 3 body island green is my fav travel retail followed by this one score 4 body green label is best label score 2 body it’s near the bottom for me i prefer black double black gold the 18 year and blue all over this one green is just so underwhelming score 5 body i prefer almost every whiskey on the rocks usually just one big cube except islays if its a bottle ive never tried before ill always try it neat first but invariably i prefer it on ice score 4 body ill give it a try with ice tonight and see how it goes cheers for the recommendation score 2 body better brand  sure  better scotch  debatable score 2 body not outrageous but 6070 is still a bit much for a daily on the compass box thing i think peat monster is the easiest of the range to focus on as its the most distinct but in no means a real peat monster anymore 10 years ago i would say peat monster was just a different peat than say a laphroaig but now its more of a peat flower still delicious just not a monster score 2 body will give it a go next time im making an oldfashioned score 1 body cheers for my own learning is there multiple distilleries i know its a blend but the main jw distillery is cardhu distillery yeah score 9 body those are the featured malts certainly not the only ones score 2 body nope those are the four that are mentioned but there are other malts in there they mention “lowlands” but none of the four mentioned malts are lowlands the rumour is that there are over 20 different malts in here score 0 body i usually take a big swig of black before i hit the trails on my hardtail score 5 body thanks for the insight peat flower gave me a chuckle i prefer peated scotch so a quality blend that exhibits it in any form is ok with me regarding daily drinkers i shake up my rotation to include scotch bourbon rye irish and aged brandy so my scotch shelf mainly holds semiweekly drinkers and i dont mind paying just a little more still i can do pretty good between 45 and 60 score 2 body deleted score 13 body cardhu is a constituent of many of the jw expressions just not this one score 4 body right score 2 body i thoroughly enjoy the double black

inbetweener as it’s 40 abv meaning it’s been watered down yet it’s a comparable price to its ever so slightly more expensive cousin johnnie walker green it appears gold label is targeted towards those who feel they’re too advanced for double black yet somehow aren’t ready for the additional exploration that green label offers see companion review herehttpswwwredditcomrscotchcommentsllpwtk16thwhiskyreview10thscotchwhiskyreviewnnfor me the nose is incredibly offputting for some reason as it initially smells like intensely of alcohol and oak with honey behind it even the cheaper iterations of jw black and double black had a better nose than gold which seems to be representative of jw gold trying to be a step up yet still being essentially the same standard as the cheaper offers nnthe palate feels synthetic almost like it was flavouring added at a later stage after their initial market research said it didn’t have defined characteristics with that said it’s there you get plenty of honey toffee and vanilla without any real subtle notes behind itnnthe finish is moderate and rich in charred oak without too much behind it again this feels lacking especially when your palate is a sweeter one that a finish of fruit or spice may have redeemed what is otherwise a poor effort from johnnie walker for the price point this is the worst of the johnnie walker range when compared to its cheaper cousins red black double black and i’d take the double black over the gold any day of the weeknnnwould i buy this to open in 10 years time no i

biscuit buckwheat honey treaclennfinish liquorice long lastingnnnotes ninitially recommended by a former work colleague i purchased redbreast 12 several months ago and have only now worked my way through the cabinet to a point where it’s been cracked open nnan engaging nose of ginger and pine nuts tends to smother out the rest however you can detect a small smell of campfire smoke in there the mouth feel is a very pleasant sensation that can best described as getting the fireplace going in an otherwise cold room and slowly feeling the warmth wash over you embracing you with a lovely warm glow that makes you wonder why you didn’t do this earlier nnthe palate is surprisingly complex sweet without being overbearing yet engaging enough that there’s plenty to explore ginger biscuit buckwheat honey and treacle all have their moments and can feel as if they’re fighting for your attention in a good way nnthe finish is long lasting and distinct a light liquorice would be the best way to describe it and once again the mouthfeel is pleasantly warm and rewarding i can see why redbreast has won a swag of awards and i owe my work colleague a nip or two by way of thanks for recommending me a wonderfully engaging whiskynnnnwould i buy this to open in 10 years time no it’s redbreast’s introductory whisky however i’d happily buy one of their higher end products to stash

absolute favourites it is indeed an excellently crafted dram score 6 body i remember buying a bottle of this back in college some 15ish years ago and thinking it was great  i wasnt big into whiskey at that point but it was just so tasty and easy to drink  fastforward to the present day when ive got a home bar with over sixty open bottles and redbreast 12 or one of their other expressions always has a place there   nnnice review score 2 body nice review it sure sounds tempting to try it out its possible to order it where i live for approximately 70 but the label looks quite different httpsbitly2ovbgnmhttpsbitly2ovbgnm is it the samennthe 15 year version is approximately 90 have you tried it too score 1 body try finedramscom they often have it and will ship it just about anywhere score 1 body literally drinking this now score 1 body sorry why would one stash away bottles for ten years score 2 body your father is bang on the money it knocked my socks off in terms of how well constructed it is as a whisky score 5 body i’ve tried the 15 and love it more than the 12 it’s worth the extra money although i still think the cask strength 12 beats both of them score 5 body ive yet to try the 15 or the cask strength however theyve now been added to the list to do so score 3 body i haven’t tried the 12 years but the 15 years is very very nice score 2 body i found links in your

stash it away with a view opening up down the road later in the whisky journeynncurrently theres a bottle of dalwhinnie 25 cask strength sitting in the whisky cabinet for a special occasion down the line be it a major birthday wedding birth of a child etc nnlikewise theres a couple bottles of glendronach 18 2019 in there as well which while theyre not nearly as expensive as some bottles in the cabinet come with their own unique production story and will be harder to procure in the future interesting or discontinued whiskies also make great gifts as well down the line as they may not be something that one can readily go out and purchase in 203x as they can in 2020 score 3 body great im going to remember that the 12 cs is not available here in sweden as far as i can see score 2 body i find myself alternating between purchasing the 12 the 12 cs and the 15 as i always like to have a bottle of redbreast in my bar  its all good shit as far as im concerned score 2 body nice same here

vanillannfinish tannin nnnotes nafter seeing ujwj2203’s post a couple weeks back reviewing the starward total wine exclusive not available here in aus i decided to revisit starward especially given they’re within walking distance of where i live and who better to support during covid than your local producer having tried the cheaper starboard twofold just prior to christmas and finding it tasting mostly like ethanol due to the lack of maturation and complexity i opted instead for the nova which having been matured in exshiraz casks i figured should offer a bit of a punch nnan interesting whisky to review the nose isn’t as prominent as other whisky no doubt once again to a lack of maturation instead you find yourself trying to look behind the overarching smell of what can best be described as ‘everything all at once’ behind it and after several attempts i found a sweet smooth and delightfully warm smell of sweet fruit strawberry with a hint of blackberry jamnnthe palate was a smoother honey cinnamon and preserved fruit tastes that leads into a charred wood taste with a hint of vanilla underneath the finish i couldn’t quite put my finger on and went hunting to find tasting notes that would answer my question to which i’ve now added the phrase ’tannin’ to my whisky vocabulary and it can be best described as a full bodied dryness which given the exshiraz casks makes complete sense nnoverall i’m glad that the decision to revisit the starward distillery was made as the nova was not only an engaging whisky but it also taught me something new which is something that should always be cherished at the risk of sounding biased given my close proximity to the distillery this is definitely one to add to your collection as it’s engaging and exploratory when compared to other options at this price point nnwould i buy this to open in 10 years time yes but more as a memento to reexplore down the line if they run out in the interimnnwould i give this as

bad uti nothing wrong with a deep mahogany in a dram but it almost looks like very slightly cloudy but thanks for the review sounds like it drinks better than it looks lol score 1 body good review maybe typo when explaining choosing two fold instead of two foldi think you mean novannalso i reckon two fold does have complexity yes its young and brash but i suggest you revisit as sidebyside with nova score 1 body deleted score 1 body to answer your price question regarding price its supply and demand economics if youve only got a batch of say 5000 bottles then you have to pick a price point that allows you to still make a profit off those 5000 bottles australia has incredibly high overheads for things like rent wages etc which all need to be factored into the price as wellnncouple that with the fact the australian whisky market is still very immature by global standards means that these distilleries are also looking to recoup the cash to put into longer term projects with a 10 year maturation however you cant do that without the profits from your sales of the 23 year old whisky nnadditionally there is a lot of established market players in japan and the us meaning theyre looking to compete on price as well as quality something australian distillers dont need to worry aboutnnin short give it time the market isnt yet mature enough and theres no one dominant player who is looking to drive prices down by supporting the local producers now youre building a better world for yourself down the line with better quality and cheaper prices score 1 body it looks like water with a coppery rust to it theres also a slight oily sheen which may have looked cloudy as i had the lights on when the photo however it doesnt appear that way in person score 2 body thanks typo edited a friend of mine mentioned they wanted to try the other starward whiskies on offer so well hopefully have a chance to do a side by side comparison soon enough score 1 body id say thats a fair assessment it wouldnt go on the top shelf but it would in a 5 interesting whiskies you should try selection score 2 body i assume youre in melbournenhit up whisky and alement cbd as well as carwyn cellars thornbury for some older singlecask bottlings theyre usually around 81 abv nnyou might find something worldclass for under aud125nnprotip look for the new world label not starward i cant believe im giving this away on reddit score 1 body many thanks for the tips ive been to whisky and alement before and had a blast will check out carwyn cellars as well normally id use nicks wine merchants for tracking down obscure whisky however the more suppliers to choose from the better anything i should look for in particular with the new world label score 1

whiskies if i’m playing poker with friends or having a 5pm i’m glad the week is over drink if this were basketball then monkey shoulder would be a layup light easy to drink and an all round inspired but not overbearing taste leaves it readily quaffed by both whisky aficionado and newcomer alike strong flavours of citrus fruit honey vanilla and apricot provide a well rounded flavour that sits well on the palette and provides a long drawn out finish of oak and peppermint nnone of the best whiskies available for the price point and although i’ll happily spend two or three times more for a more sophisticated whisky there will always be a bottle of monkey shoulder in the cabinet so long as they keep producing the stuff nnwould i buy this to open in 10 years time no it’s lacking that ’special’

bottle but i’m not sure to buy it again if mixer i neednni find this whisky great for mixing for cocktails and try some new stuff because it’s good and will not kill your test or your favorite cocktail nnhowever neat in the glass i do not find this drink specially interesting or as good as a single malt scotch just very oknnedit i agree with you in the comments but i don’t understand the note too high compare to your comment it should be around 70 as you said you will probably not by a new bottle again score 4 body what bottle would you recommend to go into the next category up or above i have just bought a bottle of moneky shoulder after finishing some glenfiddich and they largely taste the same to me it would be great to hear what bottles are considered above these to see if i can tell the difference thanks score 2 body great review monkey shoulder is one of the best whiskies out there for getting someone in to whisky i think theres a lot of snobbery around whisky but to someone that hasnt yet discovered their palate this is a fantastic starting point and like you say is fantastic for that dram to celebrate getting to the end of the week for those that have invested in more expensive bottles but want just an easy drink score 2 body this assessment is spot on its a malt albeit mixed i much prefer it to jw in the same price range its not the most complex and yet its not insipid its a good enjoyable drink for me this is the standard to judge all malts if not as good as this i qualify the malt inferior if as good as this or better in my head its a superior product score 2 body hi depps nice review hit the nail on the head that this is a decent and affordable whisky and a great introduction for someone have you tried johnnie walker green another decent blended malt score 2 body nice review it does lack something to make it stand out never thought to use it for mixing but you’re right on the money score 1 body i bought a bottle monkey shoulder too and i totally agree with you this one is staying in my whiskey cupboard  score 1 body i cant agree more to the vanilla palate aftertaste score 1 body some notes i find interesting its made using a mix of spirit from balvenie glenfiddich and kinivie i believe correct me if im wrong the name is a reference to a condition that maltmen sometimes picked up while working long shifts turning the barley by hand it had a tendency to cause their arm to hang down a bit like a monkey so they nicknamed it monkey shoulder score 11 body 25 at sams club fyi score 2 body didnt update the template too keen to post the review d score 2 body completely agree that on the grand scheme of things its not as good as a single malt its priced lower accordingly as a result and offers more versatility than youd get with a single malt think of it as an all rounder support player instead of the star player in your cabinet score 1 body maybe try a highland park 12 or an aberlour 12 to get something with a different flavour score 3 body im not surprised that ms and glenfiddich hit similar for you since one of the malts used to blend ms is glenfiddich nnhighland park 12 aberlour 12 bunnahabhain 12 are all good places to start score 2 body completely agree its not a save for the birth of your first child whisky by any stretch but its perfect for drinking when you have friends over who like whisky but dont drink whisky regularly score 2 body love the history behind the name score 3 body two good recommendations above alternately id put forward the talisker 10 as another possible step up in terms of complexity without being too overbearing score 3 body great shout on the talisker 10 it was this dram actually that i had early on in my whisky drinking and it sent me on the figurative boat to islay
