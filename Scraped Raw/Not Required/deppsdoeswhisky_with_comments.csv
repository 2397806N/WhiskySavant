Nice review though,  seems this one is still a bit young for what it offers."", 'score': 2}, {'body': ""Nc'nean Organic Highland Batch No 12\n\nSingle malt whisky. 46% ABV/92 proof\n\nDistillery: Nc’nean distillery, Caithness, Scotland\n\nPrice: AU$135/US$88\n\nAge: 3 years old\n\nChill filtered: No\n\nBottled: Nov- Dec 2021\n\nLimited edition: 5,040 bottles\n\nMaturation: 35% ex-American whiskey casks, 65% STR red wine casks\n\nBody: Old gold\n\nNose: Green apple, butterscotch, lemon cake, honey\n\nPalate: Lemon posset, white pepper\n\nFinish: Spices\n\n113 reviews in and it was bound to happen at some stage where I forgot to take a photo of the whisky before doing the review, so here we are with an empty glass. Having never heard of Nc'nean before it was quite a surprise to see a highland whisky bottled at just 3 years of age. While some Islay whisky makers are cashing in on no age statements due to their sudden brand popularity (I'm looking at you Ardbeg ) this isn't even the main point of difference for Nc'nean. Instead they pursue the planet friendly approach where every bottle is certified organic, made in their 100% renewable energy distillery and bottled in a 100% recycled glass bottle. If you ever wanted a whisky that you feel good about drinking, this seems to be the dram.\n\nThe nose is initially quite fresh and light with instant fruity notes of green apple. Softer notes of butterscotch, lemon cake and honey round out this fun to explore range. \n\nThe palette is somewhat muted and monotone, with lemon posset being the only really defining note, though there is some white pepper if it sits for some time.\n\nThe finish is short and warm.  Spices offer some character but there's again no real depth or character.\n\nI like the idea of an eco friendly whisky, and I'm open to the idea of 3 year old (or NAS) whisky from Scotland, but I'm not sure Nc'nean Organic Highland Batch No 12 is the one that ticks the box. While the nose was vibrant and fun the palette and finish were decidedly uninspiring and lacking in anything of note. The choice in casks is the contributing factor here, using ex-American whiskey casks means it's going to be very light on, which the red wine casks are supposed to offset but STR casks are also a low tier cask choice for your whisky. Combine both cask choices with only letting it mature for 3 years and you've ended up with a whisky that is unfortunately decidedly mediocre. \n\n**Final Score: 52/100**\n\n**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** \n\nNo, it's not memorable\n\n**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** \n\nOnly if they were a super environmentally conscious whisky drinker \n\n**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** \n\nOnly if they were a super environmentally conscious whisky drinker \n\nWant an alternate opinion?

Incredibly dull. \n\nThe finish is moderate and warm, again with no real notes other than some oak tannin. \n\nWell that was bland. Glengoyne 12 is what I imagine drinking whisky while having lost your sense of smell to Covid would be like. If beige was a whisky this would be it. There's nothing really of note other than to say if offered a dram while you could drink it neat you'd be better off using it as a neutral spirit in a cocktail.

It is produced by Atom Brands (who also do other whiskey brands, see Xmas reviews #3 and #4). One website described it as 'the sleeper hit of the barbecue world' and another as 'one to revisit when we get the barbecue out' so it's evident their target demographic isn't whiskey drinkers, it's people who's primary passion is not whiskey. This doesn't bode well.\n\nThe nose is initially a mix of peat and brine, underscored by vanilla notes. Not overly complex or compelling.\n\nThe palette is quite basic, rye leads into pepper. \n\nThe finish is moderate and a mix of peat and rye spice. \n\nWhen Atom Brands market to 'the barbecue world' but it seems to be 'people who haven't previously purchased this whiskey' as it's unlikely anyone would willingly buy it a second time. For the price point there's much better whiskey out there, for the world whiskey category there's much better whiskey out there and for the sake of your palete there's better whiskey out there. In terms of the entire whisky advent calendar this one is an under performer that falls under the 'stocking filler' category. Not one I'd revisit again in a hurry.\n\n**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** \n\nNo.\n\n**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** \n\nNo.\n\n**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** \n\nNo.\n\n**Final Score: 35/100**\n\nWant an alternate opinion?

Expect several successive Irish whiskey reviews to make up for it, starting with  Teeling Single Grain. Single Grain bills itself as ""approx. 95% corn 5% malted barley"", with casks being filled at 66% ABV.\n\nThe nose is vibrant and makes itself known. Melon and figs are the two main notes, while behind this toffee and the barest whisper of lemon are evident.\n\nThe palette is soft and relatively straight forward. Dried fruit and vanilla do the bulk of the heavy lifting, with cloves coming in to add an extra bit of kick the longer it sits on the palette.

It\'s evident that churning out a product made with whiskies that are ""up to 6 years old"" and spending only 6 of those months in a rum cask means there\'s no real depth, character or distinctive notes. \n\nYes, it\'s at the cheaper end and yes, it\'s not a big name distillery, but you\'d expect better for a whiskey they\'re prepared to whack a \'small batch\' label on and try sell it as something people should experience. As a direct comparison for price point the soon to be reviewed Aldi \'Puca\' Irish whiskey is a vastly superior rum cask option, along with Jameson Stout Cask (also yet to be officially reviewed) if you\'d rather a stout cask.\n\nWant an alternate opinion on this whiskey? /u/alexonthefly did a review a couple of years ago [here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/irishwhiskey/comments/itel0w/review_6_teeling_small_batch/) The second opinion review was sourced after my review was completed, so it may or may not differ.

Overall for a sherry barrel you’d expect a bit more in terms of notes and complexity.\n\n\n**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** \n\nNo, it’s not special enough.\n\n**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** \n\nIf they liked Scotch and wanted to support Australian whisky yes.\n\n**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** \n\nYes, it’s not overly polarising. \n\n\n**Final Score: 64/100**\n\nRating Scale:\n\n0-50: Just bad.\n\n51-60: Shots only.\n\n61-70: Will do if there’s no better options.\n\n71-76: Average.\n\n77-82: Good (depending on price and availability, will probably \nbuy another bottle).\n\n83-87: Great (a cut above).\n\n88-92: Excellently Crafted.\n\n93-96: Superior.\n\n97-100: Whisky Nirvana.\n\nAll previous reviews can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeppsDoesWhisky/comments/owah1r/all_reviews_by_udeppsdoeswhisky/).\n\nMy three favourites to date are \nMy three favourites reviewed to date are [Balvenie Doublewood 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/loqg67/20th_whisky_review_12th_scotch_whisky_review/) (93), [Laphroaig Quarter Cask \\(90\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h9co01/4th_whisky_review_2nd_scotch_whisky_review/), and [Glenlossie Carn Mor Strictly Limited 12 \\(90\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/gwcmps/1st_whisky_review_1st_scotch_review_glenlossie/).\n\nMy three least favourite reviews to date are [Johnnie Walker Red \\(10\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/ljjvhc/12th_whisky_review_6th_scotch_whisky_review/), [Ned Australian Whisky \\(10\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h80o69/3rd_whisky_review_1st_australian_whisky_review/), and [Archie Rose Single Paddock Whisky Harvest 2018 \\(7\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/yd2okb/54th_whisky_review_20th_australian_whisky_review/).', 'score': 2}]"

The Glenburgie 17 is one of three Ballantines single malt offerings done in collaboration with The Whisky Club, an Australian based whisky subscription service. \n\nThe nose is very fun and engaging. Pineapple initially smothers the senses, and is underscored with lighter notes of honey, vanilla and toffee. \n\nThe palette is somewhat muted initially, but opens up to reveal soft tastes of red apple and candied orange. Unfortunately the palette doesn’t quite match the expectations of the nose, in that it lacks the depth and variety that you would have expected.\n\nThe finish is quite long, warm, and lacking in real depth.

Spices, vanilla, wild honey\n\nPalate: Caramel\n\nFinish: Long and delicate. Light caramel.\n\nStarward Two-Fold is a Starward core collection offering and is so called due to it folding in two types of grains, wheat and barley. Single malts be damned. I first came across the Two-Fold just prior to Christmas 2018 when department store Myer had a tasting table set up, and really didn’t enjoy it. Since then I’ve made an active effort to avoid Starward Two-Fold, however given it’s included in my sample flight, which was a gift from last Christmas, it warrants a review even if the expectations are quite low. \n\nStarward love red wine casks, almost all of their core range (and some limited releases) involve the use of Australian red wine casks. As with any Starward review I note that this, combined with the warm Melbourne climate, typically creates a punchy and robust no age statement whisky. In this the Two-Fold isn’t much of an exception, it’s quite strong on the nose with spices and vanilla present. Wild honey is also evident.\n\nFor the palate I hope you like caramel, because that’s all your getting. It’s like a Weathers Original, but in whisky form, oh and the mouthfeel is a bit punchier than it’s 40% ABV, which isn’t surprising. \n\nThe finish is long and warm, but oddly devoid of any real notes, not even caramel.

Bottle RRP AUD$249/USD$157\n\nAge: 4 years old\n\nChill filtered: No\n\nBottled: 2022\n\nMaturation: Air dried, virgin American oak\n\nBody: Brown Sherry\n\nNose: Yeast, mandarin, Anzac biscuit \n\nPalate: Yeast, berries, ginger\n\nFinish: Orchard fruits\n\nWhenever I go to a whisky bar the same scenario inevitably unfolds each time without fail. I make several interesting whisky choices for new and exciting bottles, I take photos of the bottles, and then never actually do a review, because it's much more fun doing it at home where I’m more focused on the whisky and less on the conversation. However there has come an occasion where a review is warranted due to the uniqueness of the whisky and my experience with it. Also in the interests of disclosure I’m not an enormous fan of Rye whisky. So here we go, Archie Rose Single Paddock Whisky Harvest 2018.\n\nThe bottle was brand new and freshly opened for me by the bartender, who provided a generous pour. The nose was immediately rather off-putting and uninviting. Though I couldn’t put my finger on the particular smell at the time, some post consumption research has revealed said smell to be yeast. Behind this mandarin and Anzac Biscuit were noticeable. \n\nThe palate was horrible, more yeast than one ever needs in a whisky (there’s a question, should whisky ever feature yeast?). It’s unquestionably a rye whisky, and is best described as tasting like [The Gospel Solera Rye](https://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/p42zbi/37th_whisky_review_10th_australian_whisky_review/) mixed with kombucha. The hefty 61.6% cask smothers a lot of the experience and you’re left trying to navigate through the sea of yeast to find the berries and ginger underneath. \n\nThe finish I enjoyed, namely as it meant that it was over and done for. Warm, lingering and with orchard fruits the finish is unquestionably the best part of this experience. Repeating it with a few drops of water to take the edge off did very little to open up the whisky at all, it’s hell bent on assaulting the senses with a feast of yeast.\n\nAs always I’m a fan of distilleries who break the mould and try new things. Archie Rose have released a bunch of whisky recently under their ’Trials and Expectations’ series, and Single Paddock Whisky Harvest 2018 is both their most hyped and most expensive of this series. While I understand it appeals to a certain demographic of rye whisky enthusiasts this whisky reminds me of a [Ben Nevis](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/lxvdgk/27th_whisky_review_17th_scotch_whisky_review_ben/) single cask for the fact that it’s polarising and not for the majority. \n\nFor me this whisky is bad, not in a ‘Johnnie Walker Red tastes like ethanol’ kind of way where you know it’s meant to taste like that, this tastes bad in a way that says ‘we committed to this project and it turned out shit, but we had to bottle and sell it anyway’.

I also really rated their original Tawny release, however didn’t review it. Now the conflicts of interest are out of way let’s get into the review.\n\nThe Starward Tawny #2 is quite enjoyable on the nose, though it’s not overly complex. Dried fruit immediately grabs your attention, and orange isn’t far behind. Toasted oak is also evident when you explore further. Overall the nose is the equivalent to sticking your nose into a bowl of dried fruit that’s been given a quick soak in Tawny wine before it gets thrown into a Christmas pudding. \n\nThe palate is initially surprisingly sweet, before that’s quickly kicked aside by the robustness I’ve come to expect from a Starward whisky. The initial sweetness is a welcome change, no doubt due to the longer maturation process. While it lacks any complexity and real depth it is still quite rewarding with dried fruit and nutmeg featuring prominently, with lighter notes of brown sugar evident with a bit of exploration. \n\nThe finish is long and well balanced. The spice leaves a warm and pleasant feel well after you’ve finished, and sits on the tongue for quite some time with an enjoyable mouthfeel. \n\nFirstly the big difference from almost all other Starward whiskies is the sweeter notes that present in Tawny #2. This is no doubt due to it being aged 7 years, while most Starward whisky is bottled at a 3-4 year range and as such is quite robust and punchy. This more mature product is no doubt due to the change in location in 2016 which allowed them to expand their production and rely less on quicker turnover of product, and it bodes well for the future. \n\nOverall Tawny #2 is an ideal winter whisky, and one of my favourites to date from Starward Distillery. \n\n\n**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** \n\nPossibly, if I had the cupboard space and wanted to compare it to the inevitable Tawny #3\n\n**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** \n\nYes, it would make a great gift\n\n**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** \n\nNo, it’s not a good introductory whisky\n\n\n**Final Score: 88/100**\n\nRating Scale:\n\n0-50: Just bad.\n\n51-60: Shots only.\n\n61-70: Will do if there’s no better options.\n\n71-76: Average.\n\n77-82: Good (depending on price and availability, will probably \nbuy another bottle).\n\n83-87: Great (a cut above).\n\n88-92: Excellently Crafted.\n\n93-96: Superior.\n\n97-100: Whisky Nirvana.\n\nAll previous reviews can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeppsDoesWhisky/comments/owah1r/all_reviews_by_udeppsdoeswhisky/).\n\nMy three favourites to date are \nMy three favourites reviewed to date are [Balvenie Doublewood 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/loqg67/20th_whisky_review_12th_scotch_whisky_review/) (93), [Laphroaig Quarter Cask \\(90\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h9co01/4th_whisky_review_2nd_scotch_whisky_review/), and [Glenlossie Carn Mor Strictly Limited 12 \\(90\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/gwcmps/1st_whisky_review_1st_scotch_review_glenlossie/).\n\nMy three least favourite reviews to date are [Johnnie Walker Red \\(10\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/ljjvhc/12th_whisky_review_6th_scotch_whisky_review/), [Ned Australian Whisky \\(10\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h80o69/3rd_whisky_review_1st_australian_whisky_review/), and [Archie Rose White Rye \\(30\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/owaatj/35th_whisky_review_8th_australian_whisky_review/).', 'score': 1}]"

Overall the nose is the equivalent to sticking your nose into a bowl of dried fruit that’s been given a quick soak in Tawny wine before it gets thrown into a Christmas pudding. \n\nThe palate is initially surprisingly sweet, before that’s quickly kicked aside by the robustness I’ve come to expect from a Starward whisky. The initial sweetness is a welcome change, no doubt due to the longer maturation process. While it lacks any complexity and real depth it is still quite rewarding with dried fruit and nutmeg featuring prominently, with lighter notes of brown sugar evident with a bit of exploration. \n\nThe finish is long and well balanced. The spice leaves a warm and pleasant feel well after you’ve finished, and sits on the tongue for quite some time with an enjoyable mouthfeel. \n\nFirstly the big difference from almost all other Starward whiskies is the sweeter notes that present in Tawny #2. This is no doubt due to it being aged 7 years, while most Starward whisky is bottled at a 3-4 year range and as such is quite robust and punchy. This more mature product is no doubt due to the change in location in 2016 which allowed them to expand their production and rely less on quicker turnover of product, and it bodes well for the future. \n\nOverall Tawny #2 is an ideal winter whisky, and one of my favourites to date from Starward Distillery. \n\n\n**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** \n\nPossibly, if I had the cupboard space and wanted to compare it to the inevitable Tawny #3\n\n**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** \n\nYes, it would make a great gift\n\n**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** \n\nNo, it’s not a good introductory whisky\n\n\n**Final Score: 88/100**\n\nRating Scale:\n\n0-50: Just bad.\n\n51-60: Shots only.\n\n61-70: Will do if there’s no better options.\n\n71-76: Average.\n\n77-82: Good (depending on price and availability, will probably \nbuy another bottle).\n\n83-87: Great (a cut above).\n\n88-92: Excellently Crafted.\n\n93-96: Superior.\n\n97-100: Whisky Nirvana.\n\nAll previous reviews can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeppsDoesWhisky/comments/owah1r/all_reviews_by_udeppsdoeswhisky/).\n\nMy three favourites to date are \nMy three favourites reviewed to date are [Balvenie Doublewood 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/loqg67/20th_whisky_review_12th_scotch_whisky_review/) (93), [Laphroaig Quarter Cask \\(90\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h9co01/4th_whisky_review_2nd_scotch_whisky_review/), and [Glenlossie Carn Mor Strictly Limited 12 \\(90\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/gwcmps/1st_whisky_review_1st_scotch_review_glenlossie/).\n\nMy three least favourite reviews to date are [Johnnie Walker Red \\(10\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/ljjvhc/12th_whisky_review_6th_scotch_whisky_review/), [Ned Australian Whisky \\(10\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h80o69/3rd_whisky_review_1st_australian_whisky_review/), and [Archie Rose White Rye \\(30\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/owaatj/35th_whisky_review_8th_australian_whisky_review/).', 'score': 2}]"

This gives way to dry oak, and is underscored with what can best be described as the solvent like smell of nail varnish remover, though in the interests of disclosure I recently had covid, so it’s highly possible my sense of smell is still somewhat misaligned. \n\nThe palate is soft and largely follows the nose in terms of sweetness. An enjoyable mix of vanilla and honeycomb take hold almost immediately, which is a lot of fun to explore as not enough whiskies offer up a honeycomb taste in my opinion, it’s usually toffee or honey. Candied fruits underscore the sweetness of it all and a hint of cinnamon gives it that little bit more edge that it would otherwise be lacking.\n\nThe finish is moderate and quite simple, with black pepper giving way to a caramelised banana. \n\nOverall Cowra Characters surprised me, as it’s a solid whisky as far as Australian distilleries go. The fun and engaging tastes of honeycomb and caramelised banana provide a point of difference, however where it falls down is the same as the [Glenfiddich Reserve Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/vb8f0i/49th_whisky_review_29th_scotch_whisky_review/), namely that it doesn’t have that depth you’d typically want out of a whisky. With that said for the price point of ~AU$90/US$61 for a 500ml bottle it almost holds its own. Worth exploring if you’re into light and fruity whisky, but it’s unlikely to become a staple of your collection. \n\n**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** \n\nNo, it’s not worth holding onto.\n\n**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** \n\nPossibly, if they’re someone who enjoys trying smaller distillers. \n\n**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** \n\nYes, it would make a good introductory whisky. \n\n\n**Final Score: 81/100**\n\nRating Scale:\n\n0-50: Just bad.\n\n51-60: Shots only.\n\n61-70: Will do if there’s no better options.\n\n71-76: Average.\n\n77-82: Good (depending on price and availability, will probably \nbuy another bottle).\n\n83-87: Great (a cut above).\n\n88-92: Excellently Crafted.\n\n93-96: Superior.\n\n97-100: Whisky Nirvana.\n\nAll previous reviews can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeppsDoesWhisky/comments/owah1r/all_reviews_by_udeppsdoeswhisky/).\n\nMy three favourites to date are \nMy three favourites reviewed to date are [Balvenie Doublewood 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/loqg67/20th_whisky_review_12th_scotch_whisky_review/) (93), [Laphroaig Quarter Cask \\(90\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h9co01/4th_whisky_review_2nd_scotch_whisky_review/), and [Glenlossie Carn Mor Strictly Limited 12 \\(90\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/gwcmps/1st_whisky_review_1st_scotch_review_glenlossie/).\n\nMy three least favourite reviews to date are [Johnnie Walker Red \\(10\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/ljjvhc/12th_whisky_review_6th_scotch_whisky_review/), [Ned Australian Whisky \\(10\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h80o69/3rd_whisky_review_1st_australian_whisky_review/), and [Archie Rose White Rye \\(30\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/owaatj/35th_whisky_review_8th_australian_whisky_review/).', 'score': 4}, {'body': 'Nice review.. that glass looks enormous', 'score': 1}, {'body': 'Nail varnish remover...tempting 😁', 'score': 1}, {'body': ""It's a Denver and Liely glass, highly recommended!"", 'score': 1}, {'body': 'First time I’ve used it as a description but it’s definitely there (at least to my covid sense of smell)!', 'score': 2}, {'body': 'Thx...give it a look-see', 'score': 1}]"

Glenfiddich predominantly position themselves in the low and low-middle end of the whisky market with whisky that aims to appeal to the masses rather than the enthusiast. Side note I’m surprised it’s taken me 49 previous reviews to reach a Glenfiddich, as my first introduction into single malt whisky was a Glenfiddich 12. \n\nThis whisky was thoughtfully purchased by a friend for us to explore together. At 40% ABV, and coloured with the dreaded E150 caramel colouring, my expectations going into this whisky were quite low. \n\nThe nose offers Christmas spice, oak, and citrus, though it is somewhat muted and not as enticing as it would otherwise be at a higher ABV. \n\nThe palette is incredibly velvet smooth and contains a surprising amount of depth. Malted grain, vanilla, and caramel all feature prominently and jostle for position. Behind that oak and dark chocolate notes can be found, although these require a little bit of exploration. This is rounded out by a subtle yet distinct taste of anise.  \n\nThe finish is long and bold, which again is a surprise given the ABV.

Glenfiddich predominantly position themselves in the low and low-middle end of the whisky market with whisky that aims to appeal to the masses rather than the enthusiast. Side note I’m surprised it’s taken me 49 previous reviews to reach a Glenfiddich, as my first introduction into single malt whisky was a Glenfiddich 12. \n\nThis whisky was thoughtfully purchased by a friend for us to explore together. At 40% ABV, and coloured with the dreaded E150 caramel colouring, my expectations going into this whisky were quite low. \n\nThe nose offers Christmas spice, oak, and citrus, though it is somewhat muted and not as enticing as it would otherwise be at a higher ABV. \n\nThe palette is incredibly velvet smooth and contains a surprising amount of depth. Malted grain, vanilla, and caramel all feature prominently and jostle for position. Behind that oak and dark chocolate notes can be found, although these require a little bit of exploration. This is rounded out by a subtle yet distinct taste of anise.  \n\nThe finish is long and bold, which again is a surprise given the ABV. Cloves, citrus, oak, and vanilla are all present, and the finish is warm and enticing.  \n\nGoing into it with such low expectations I’ve got to say the Glenfiddich Reserve Cask has outperformed my expectations.

With that said it is a great whisky, and a score of 83 reflects it's good value for the price-point. \n\n**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** \n\nNo, it’s missing that special something that warrants a revisit.\n\n**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** \n\nYes, it’s enjoyable and would suffice as a gift. \n\n**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** \n\nYes, it’s enjoyable without being too polarising. \n\n\n**Final Score: 83/100**\n\nRating Scale:\n\n0-50: Just bad.\n\n51-60: Shots only.\n\n61-70: Will do if there’s no better options.\n\n71-76: Average.\n\n77-82: Good (depending on price and availability, will probably \nbuy another bottle).\n\n83-87: Great (a cut above).\n\n88-92: Excellently Crafted.\n\n93-96: Superior.\n\n97-100: Whisky Nirvana.\n\nAll previous reviews can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeppsDoesWhisky/comments/owah1r/all_reviews_by_udeppsdoeswhisky/).\n\nMy three favourites to date are \nMy three favourites reviewed to date are [Balvenie Doublewood 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/loqg67/20th_whisky_review_12th_scotch_whisky_review/) (93), [Laphroaig Quarter Cask \\(90\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h9co01/4th_whisky_review_2nd_scotch_whisky_review/), and [Glenlossie Carn Mor Strictly Limited 12 \\(90\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/gwcmps/1st_whisky_review_1st_scotch_review_glenlossie/).\n\nMy three least favourite reviews to date are [Johnnie Walker Red \\(10\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/ljjvhc/12th_whisky_review_6th_scotch_whisky_review/), [Ned Australian Whisky \\(10\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h80o69/3rd_whisky_review_1st_australian_whisky_review/), and [Archie Rose White Rye \\(30\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/owaatj/35th_whisky_review_8th_australian_whisky_review/)."", 'score': 1}]"

My friend who missed out visited on the weekend and dropped the news that he and his partner are expecting their first child, which warrants opening a special bottle and A Whisky in Every Port ticked the box perfectly in living up to the expectations. \n\nIn short this whisky is bloody good, but part of that may be the fact that I’m unlikely to ever try it again, and it is now forever associated with a joyful celebration with a much loved friend. To me that’s how whisky is meant to be enjoyed, good company, good whisky, good conversation and good memories. And if you’re able to forever tie a certain whisky to a certain event, then that’s a damn fine way to do it in my opinion.\n\n**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** \n\nYes, if I can get my hands on another bottle I certainly will\n\n**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** \n\nYes, but only if I obtained two bottles moving forward. I wouldn’t gift my own replacement bottle.\n\n**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** \n\nNo, it would waste a very good whisky on someone who won’t appreciate it\n\n\n**Final Score: 90/100**\n\nRating Scale:\n\n0-50: Just bad.\n\n51-60: Shots only.\n\n61-70: Will do if there’s no better options.\n\n71-76: Average.\n\n77-82: Good (depending on price and availability, will probably \nbuy another bottle).\n\n83-87: Great (a cut above).\n\n88-92: Excellently Crafted.\n\n93-96: Superior.\n\n97-100: Whisky Nirvana.\n\nAll previous reviews can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeppsDoesWhisky/comments/owah1r/all_reviews_by_udeppsdoeswhisky/).\n\nMy three favourites to date are \nMy three favourites reviewed to date are [Balvenie Doublewood 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/loqg67/20th_whisky_review_12th_scotch_whisky_review/) (93), [Laphroaig Quarter Cask \\(90\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h9co01/4th_whisky_review_2nd_scotch_whisky_review/), and [Glenlossie Carn Mor Strictly Limited 12 \\(90\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/gwcmps/1st_whisky_review_1st_scotch_review_glenlossie/).\n\nMy three least favourite reviews to date are [Johnnie Walker Red \\(10\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/ljjvhc/12th_whisky_review_6th_scotch_whisky_review/), [Ned Australian Whisky \\(10\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h80o69/3rd_whisky_review_1st_australian_whisky_review/), and [Archie Rose White Rye \\(30\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/owaatj/35th_whisky_review_8th_australian_whisky_review/).', 'score': 6}, {'body': 'Great review.

(bottled unknown)\n\nDistillery: Archie Rose Distillery, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia\n\nPrice: ~USD$11 / AUD$15 for a 30ml pour\n\nAge: NAS\n\nChill filtered: No\n\nMaturation: Not matured\n\nBody: White, translucent\n\nNose: rose petals, herbs\n\nPalate: tropical fruits, sweet spices, amaretto\n\nFinish: anise, spices \n\nNotes:\n\nHad debated buying a bottle of the Archie Rose White Rye in the past, however decided against it and resolved instead to give it a try when the opportunity arose. Fortunately it arose whilst visiting Polly Bar in Fitzroy, Melbourne. I tried taking a photo, however the dim lighting and my otherwise preoccupation lead to two horribly blurry photos, so a generic stock photo of the bottle will have to suffice for this review.\n\nFirstly a quick rundown on white whisky, as it’s not overly common outside the US. White whisky ""is essentially a raw, unfinished product on its way to becoming grown-up whiskey. In the regular whiskey production process, a fermented, grain-based mash is distilled to higher proof (ABV) and aged for varying periods of time in oak barrels.White whiskey skips that last—theoretically essential—aging step and goes right to the bottle. Yes, to be called “whiskey” (just whiskey, not bourbon or rye or single malt, etc.) the spirit technically has to be stored in oak, but this could last as little as 10 seconds, imparting none of the caramel or wood or pepper or fruit or smoke we’ve come to know and love in our whiskies. What you get instead is basically naked grain.

This is followed by softer tones of oak spice and wild honey underneath. \n\nThe palate is a silky and syrupy sweetness, though not sickly sweet like The Original. It takes some time to open up a bit, however the toffee, honey and vanilla notes eventually make themselves known. No real robust or delicate notes present. \n\nThe finish is medium, and much like The Original. That is to say honeyed fruit to begin with before being overtaken by an unusual taste that I can best pin down as malted barley, though comparing my notes to tasting notes online no one else described it quite like this. \n\nFirstly the naming Glenmorangie Nectar d’Or is perfect, with the use of French wine casks and the rich golden colour of the whisky itself.

This is followed by softer tones of oak spice and wild honey underneath. \n\nThe palate is a silky and syrupy sweetness, though not sickly sweet like The Original. It takes some time to open up a bit, however the toffee, honey and vanilla notes eventually make themselves known. No real robust or delicate notes present. \n\nThe finish is medium, and much like The Original. That is to say honeyed fruit to begin with before being overtaken by an unusual taste that I can best pin down as malted barley, though comparing my notes to tasting notes online no one else described it quite like this. \n\nFirstly the naming Glenmorangie Nectar d’Or is perfect, with the use of French wine casks and the rich golden colour of the whisky itself.

With that said, as far as supporting Australian distilleries goes, Archie Rose presents a wonderful offering at this price point with a distinctive whisky that lends itself to being a go to option for almost any occasion.  \n\n\n**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** \n\nLikely not, they will have better offerings over the next 10 years\n\n**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** \n\nAbsolutely, the bottling and uniqueness makes it a great gift\n\n**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** \n\nYes, the presentation alone makes it an ideal gift, but the whisky also helps. \n\n**Final Score: 78/100**\n\nRating Scale:\n\n0-50: Just bad.\n\n51-60: Shots only.\n\n61-70: Will do if there’s no better options.\n\n71-76: Average.\n\n77-82: Good (depending on price and availability, will probably \nbuy another bottle).\n\n83-87: Great (a cut above).\n\n88-92: Excellently Crafted.\n\n93-96: Superior.\n\n97-100: Whisky Nirvana.\n\nAll previous reviews can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeppsDoesWhisky/comments/lr97dt/all_reviews_by_udeppsdoeswhisky/).\n\nMy three favourites to date are \nMy three favourites reviewed to date are [Balvenie Doublewood 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/loqg67/20th_whisky_review_12th_scotch_whisky_review/) (93), [Laphroaig Quarter Cask \\(90\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h9co01/4th_whisky_review_2nd_scotch_whisky_review/), and [Glenlossie Carn Mor Strictly Limited 12 \\(90\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/gwcmps/1st_whisky_review_1st_scotch_review_glenlossie/).\n\nMy three least favourite reviews to date are [Ned Australian Whisky \\(40\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h80o69/3rd_whisky_review_1st_australian_whisky_review/), [Johnnie Walker Red \\(45\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/ljjvhc/12th_whisky_review_6th_scotch_whisky_review/), and [Johnnie Walker Gold \\(50\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/llpwhn/15th_whisky_review_9th_scotch_whisky_review/).', 'score': 1}]"

In my companion review I recommended heading down to the Starward Distillery in Port Melbourne to give the Cherry Wood small batch a try, it would be remiss of you not to add the Ginger Beer #5 to the tasting flight while you’re there.

The malt was smoked using cherry wood much like you would a barbecued meat. It is a new take on peated whisky, instead of using peat to provide the flavour, you use particular woods.\n\n\nEdit: why no cherry wood casks?\n\nCherry wood is much more porous than oak and provides a more oxidative environment (more oxygen contact). This has worked well for wineries as it provides a shorter aging process, but is difficult to work with in whisky due to the volatility in flavour.

(see companion review [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/llpwud/16th_whisky_review_10th_scotch_whisky_review/))\n\nFor me the nose is incredibly off-putting for some reason, as it initially smells like intensely of alcohol and oak with more honey behind it. Even the cheaper iterations of JW Black and Double Black had a better nose than Gold, which seems to be representative of JW Gold trying to be a step up, yet still being essentially the same standard as the cheaper offers. \n\nThe palate feels synthetic, almost like it was flavouring added at a later stage after their initial market research said it didn’t have defined characteristics. With that said it’s there, you get plenty of honey, toffee and vanilla without any real subtle notes behind it.\n\nThe finish is moderate and rich in charred oak, without too much behind it. Again this feels lacking, especially when your palate is a sweeter one that a finish of fruit or spice may have redeemed what is otherwise a poor effort from Johnnie Walker.

It appears Gold Label is targeted towards those who feel they’re too advanced for Double Black, yet somehow aren’t ready for the additional exploration that Green Label offers. (see companion review [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/llpwtk/16th_whisky_review_10th_scotch_whisky_review/))\n\nFor me the nose is incredibly off-putting for some reason, as it initially smells like intensely of alcohol and oak with honey behind it. Even the cheaper iterations of JW Black and Double Black had a better nose than Gold, which seems to be representative of JW Gold trying to be a step up, yet still being essentially the same standard as the cheaper offers. \n\nThe palate feels synthetic, almost like it was flavouring added at a later stage after their initial market research said it didn’t have defined characteristics. With that said it’s there, you get plenty of honey, toffee and vanilla without any real subtle notes behind it.\n\nThe finish is moderate and rich in charred oak, without too much behind it. Again this feels lacking, especially when your palate is a sweeter one that a finish of fruit or spice may have redeemed what is otherwise a poor effort from Johnnie Walker. For the price point this is the worst of the Johnnie Walker range when compared to its cheaper cousins (Red, Black, Double Black) and I’d take the Double Black over the Gold any day of the week.\n\n\n**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** No, I wouldn’t even buy it to open in 1 years time let alone 10.\n\n**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** No, they’d think I’m an idiot.\n\n**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** \nNo, they wouldn’t initially think I’m idiot but they would at some point in the future.\n\n**Final Score: 50/100**\n\nRating Scale:\n\n0-50: Just bad.\n\n51-60: Shots only.\n\n61-70: Will do if there’s no better options.\n\n71-76: Average.\n\n77-82: Good (depending on price and availability, will probably \nbuy another bottle).\n\n83-87: Great (a cut above).\n\n88-92: Excellently Crafted.\n\n93-96: Superior.\n\n97-100: Whisky Nirvana.', 'score': 21}, {'body': 'If your scale is 0-100 how is 50 not average?\nMaybe the scale should be 0-50.', 'score': 7}, {'body': 'Can I just say bless you for doing these back-to-back-to-back reviews of whiskies you clearly are not enjoying very much, solely for the purposes of JW completionism.

(bottled 2020)\n\nDistillery: Starward Distillery, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\n\nPrice: ~USD$55 / AUD$80\n\nAge: unknown\n\nChill filtered: No\n\nMaturation Profile: ex-shiraz casks\n\nBody: red ochre, oily\n\nNose: sweet fruits, strawberry, blackberry jam\n\nPalate: honey, cinnamon, preserved fruit, charred wood, vanilla\n\nFinish: tannin \n\nNotes: \nAfter seeing /u/JWJ2203’s post a couple weeks back reviewing the Starward Total Wine Exclusive (not available here in Aus) I decided to revisit Starward, especially given they’re within walking distance of where I live and who better to support during COVID than your local producer. Having tried the cheaper Starboard Twofold just prior to Christmas and finding it tasting mostly like ethanol due to the lack of maturation and complexity I opted instead for the Nova which, having been matured in ex-shiraz casks I figured should offer a bit of a punch. \n\nAn interesting whisky to review the nose isn’t as prominent as other whisky, no doubt once again to a lack of maturation. Instead you find yourself trying to look behind the overarching smell of what can best be described as ‘everything all at once’. Behind it, and after several attempts, I found a sweet, smooth and delightfully warm smell of sweet fruit, strawberry with a hint of blackberry jam.\n\nThe palate was a smoother honey, cinnamon and preserved fruit tastes that leads into a charred wood taste with a hint of vanilla underneath. The finish I couldn’t quite put my finger on and went hunting to find tasting notes that would answer my question, to which I’ve now added the phrase ’tannin’ to my whisky vocabulary and it can be best described as a full bodied dryness, which given the ex-shiraz casks, makes complete sense. \n\nOverall I’m glad that the decision to revisit the Starward Distillery was made, as the Nova was not only an engaging whisky but it also taught me something new, which is something that should always be cherished. At the risk of sounding biased given my close proximity to the distillery this is definitely one to add to your collection as it’s engaging and exploratory when compared to other options at this price point. \n\nWould I buy this to open in 10 years time: Yes, but more as a memento to re-explore down the line if they run out in the interim.\n\nWould I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast: Yes, with a unique complexion it makes the ideal gift. \n\nWould I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky: No, it’s likely to be off-putting to someone who doesn’t drink a lot of whisky. \n\n**Final Score: 80/100**\n\nRating Scale:\n\n0-50: Just bad.\n\n51-60: Shots only.\n\n61-70: Will do if there’s no better options.\n\n71-76: Average.\n\n77-82: Good (depending on price and availability, will probably buy another bottle).\n\n83-87: Great (a cut above).\n\n88-92: Excellently Crafted.\n\n93-96: Superior.\n\n97-100: Whisky Nirvana.', 'score': 2}, {'body': '80/100?

Australian blended whisky. 40% ABV. (bottled unknown)

Distillery: Top Shelf International, Campbellfied, Victoria, Australia

Price: ~USD$41 / AUD$60

Age: unknown

Chill filtered: Unable to find out, however I'd have to assume yes given it's 40% ABV and the review below.

Maturation Profile: Matured in Oak barrels, charcoal finish

Body: light; thick

Nose:honey, caramel, liquorice, vanilla

Palate: oily, vanilla, honey, caramel, stone fruits

Finish: spices, vanilla

Notes: Decided to support local whisky producers during covid and purchased a bottle of NED as it’s distilled less than 30 kilometres (18.5 miles) from my house. The nose, palate and finish are all sickly sweet. I once read of a man who suffered maple syrup disease, whereby his urine smelt like maple syrup as he was unable to digest certain amino acids properly. This is the closest thing I can compare with NED, it’s sickly sweet and smothers your palette to a point where you’re worried it will start attracting ants.

As a whisky that doesn’t list its age I can only assume it’s 3-4 years years old as none of the flavours have had time to mellow. The sweet lingering taste is very sugary and left me feeling like I’d end up with diabetes if I consumed any more.

Would I buy this to open in 10 years time: No, definitely not.

Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast: No, unless they really liked sweet whiskey like Jack Daniels

Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky: No, it would distort their whisky drinking experience

**Final Score: 40/100**

Rating Scale:

0-50: Just bad.

51-60: Shots only.

61-70: Will do if there’s no better options.

71-76: Average.

77-82: Good (depending on price and availability, will probably buy another bottle).

83-87: Great (a cut above).

88-92: Excellently Crafted.

93-96: Superior.

97-100: Whisky Nirvana.",[]

While I can appreciate that’s ideal for some whisky drinkers, it’s not me at all, however I was fortunate enough to try the Laphroaig 18 which was a lot nicer as the more subdued and well rounded flavours that combined to deliver an excellent drinking experience. \nBut enough about the other Laphroig offerings, let’s focus on the task at hand, Laphroaig Quarter Cask. The reason for the prior rambling is that the Quarter Cask fits in somewhere in between the Laphroaig 10 and the Laphroaig 18 in terms of complexity and peatiness and it’s excellent. The initial overwhelming peat, smoke and salt gives way to a more mellow and subdued taste which is rich and inviting. The final notes don’t liner, rather they stay around for a considerable time treating the drinker to a rich and inviting warmth. Overall a well rounded and highly recommended whisky.\n\nWould I buy this to open in 10 years time: Yes, though I can’t see a need to do so.\n\nWould I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast: Yes, absolutely. \n\nWould I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky: Possibly, if the gift was for someone who was into other spirits such as rum.\n\nFinal Score: 90/100\n\nRating Scale:\n\n0-50: Just bad.\n\n51-60: Shots only.\n\n61-70: Will do if there’s no better options.\n\n71-76: Average.\n\n77-82: Good (depending on price and availability, will probably buy another bottle).\n\n83-87: Great (a cut above).\n\n88-92: Excellently Crafted.\n\n93-96: Superior.\n\n97-100: Whisky Nirvana.', 'score': 1}]"
