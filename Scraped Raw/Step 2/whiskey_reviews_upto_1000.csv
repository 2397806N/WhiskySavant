How to differentiate the notes of whiskey?,I‚Äôve always had a hard time trying to decipher the notes when I‚Äôm drinking whiskey. I read reviews of people getting all sorts of different noteson the nose and palate of a whiskey. I can definitely taste the difference between whiskeys but can‚Äôt pick out specific notes. Any one have some tips? ,"I get Three notes:
1. Oh this is good I like it!
2. It‚Äôs okay, kinda meh. 
3. This sucks!
 Eh, I‚Äôm old and don‚Äôt want to think that hard.
Google whisky sensory/flavour wheel. It might help
Try this. Sniff the whiskey, write down what you smell. If you can't figure it out exactly, describe it. Taste it. Do the same thing. After you have that written down, go back and find tasting notes for it and compare. You'll start making connections this way. Also, try a NEAT glass. They were designed for drinking whiskey. It helps get the ethonal vapors out of the way and helps get to the aromas. I have a couple of buddies who have a whiskey podcast, and this is exactly what they did to get better at tasting notes.
Smell from further away in small whiffs. 
 Taste small sips and roll them around and inhale short breaths . 
Use dashes of water to open it up. 
Don't swirl too much. 
Practice a ton. 
Whiskey judges work for years to hone a skill. ....

Master blenders spend decades
Kinda how I feel haha
Thank you!
A good way to find a note in a spirit is to smell it side by side. For example crown Royal deluxe has a clove aroma from the rye grain. Smell them side by side repeatedly until you train your brain to find that note. After that you'll never lose it.
You're welcome. In the event you're interested, my buddies' podcast is The Whiskey Tangent. They do all sorts of things to keep it interesting. Right now, they're in the middle of their Whiskey Madness episodes. It's also a great way to find something new to try.
I‚Äôll check it out! I like listening to the podcasts. 

I had some angels envy tonight. Picked up on some notes and compared them to what others said online and got a couple similar ones
There you go! Remember, don't get discouraged, because it will take some time. Good sites for reviews that have easy to understand tasting notes are the whiskey wash, breaking bourbon and the whiskey jug (though the gentleman who runs the site, seems to have fallen off the face of the Earth). If you try some barrel spirits, definitely find a review somewhere, as their own tasting notes are pretentious, lol."
How did my fellow Virginians do today?,"Virginia ABC barrel pick release day. 

I am a Maker‚Äôs Mark lover and was happy to pick up this bottle, especially with a name like creamy caramel. 

Also picked up my first High West product. Cabernet Sauvignon finish is what I am diving into first. I‚Äôll post a comment with my tasting notes in a little bit. 

I think four roses was the main target of the day. 

How‚Äôd you make out in VA?","Not from Va but if that‚Äôs your first HW you did good. You are all set for the weekend.
I too got a bottle of the Maker's mine is called marshmallow delight
I picked up the HW Chardonnay.  Is very good but tastes more single malt than bourbon.  Our Makers was something like ‚ÄúMega Chocolate.‚Äù  I would have picked up the 1792 Full Proof but forgot about the event until lunch and it was all gone.
I am a rye guy so I gladly started across town to grab the Knob Creek single barrel then went back across to my home store and snagged the Clyde May‚Äôs single barrel. 2 more stores in town but they didn‚Äôt have anything that peaked my interest. I did as a bonus though pick up a Bardstown origin series rye.

The four roses was def the best of the list imo. A lot of people I talked to were after the EC private barrel. I say whatever floats your boat.
I got the marshmallow makers and a 1792 full proof
High West doesn‚Äôt miss
Totally forgot ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Nice pick ups! Got a Four Roses. Both of those look good. Wanted to try the high west
Got a Four Roses, ECBP and a 1729 Full Proof. So I count that as a good day!
Bulleit, 1792 BiB, Rebel, Clyde May rye, tromba tequila. I might go back to a few today and see if anything is left. Nobody was really buying any at the stores in my area.
It‚Äôs been a wild weekend for me, I decided to due a one time bar building extravaganza. Whole new cocktail kit, all new glassware, and about 12 bottles of base spirits. 

Just a few sips into the HW and I am really liking it.
Man that sounds good too. I would‚Äôve happily bought all the makers variations.
I‚Äôve cracked into my makers and I love it. High proof wheaters are my favorite. 

The HW cab sauv feels ‚Äúrefined‚Äù and it‚Äôs enjoyable with a pleasant bitterness. 

I definitely wanted that mega chocolate.
Yeah I would‚Äôve certainly grabbed a knob creek if I saw it. I like a good rye too I just have a lot on my shelf right now.
That is a solid days work
Right on.
Yeah the chocolate one was only 100 proof so I passed.  I am sure they will have a few tomorrow if I swing back by.  For me it was between the EC and the HW.  This is also my first HW product (although I have had HW before at a bar)."
"Drink This, Not That! Volume 1","Are you getting out-tatered? Are you asking yourself why we‚Äôre going through all this nonsense to obtain bottles that not all that long ago were found on shelves everywhere? Maybe you don‚Äôt have a hookup, or maybe you‚Äôve had to blow your rent or mortgage payment money to get a BTAC, or maybe you tented in front of a liquor store overnight because a Facebook post told you there‚Äôd be a Pappy available in the morning. Well I‚Äôm here to tell you, it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. It is well past time to cut through the bullshit in the whiskey world. In this series, I‚Äôm gonna review tater bottles against something I think is very comparable (or better!) but most importantly, at least slightly more findable. 

I should warn you, these reviews are going to be different than what you‚Äôre used to. I‚Äôm just an average dude, like most people. And like most people, I can‚Äôt pull out a dozen tasting notes from a whiskey. It‚Äôs a blessing in a way. It makes it easier to recognize when the emperor is not wearing any clothes but since palates are fickle things, your mileage might vary. 

Seeing as this is my first volume of this series, I‚Äôm coming out swinging at the top o‚Äô the tater bottle, Blanton‚Äôs. Probably the most talked about bottle on the planet. It‚Äôs hyped to say the least. But does it deserve its title as tater king? I‚Äôd say no. So here‚Äôs the matchup: Blanton‚Äôs Single Barrel vs. Redwood Empire Pipe Dream. 

First, let‚Äôs look at the stats. To start, the horsey top. 

Buffalo Trace Distillery, Single Barrel, generally 6-8 years old, bottled at 93 proof. $65ish dollars for a bottle from a store that hasn‚Äôt lost its soul, $100-110 for the guys that like to use the term ‚Äòdoll hairs‚Äô.

Second, the challenger. Tall bottle, white label with the interesting art. 

Redwood Empire, a blend of whiskey‚Äôs 4-12 years of I believe MGP stock, bottled at 90 proof. $40-$45 all day long, NO inflated secondary value. 

So, I owe quite a bit to Blanton‚Äôs. It was the first sought after ‚Äúrare‚Äù bottle I was able to luck into and it made me appreciate that this whole whiskey thing is kinda fun. Since then, I‚Äôve bought two more that I‚Äôve traded away for better bottles without a second thought. And passed on it a dozen other times. If I never open another, that‚Äôll be just fine. In fact, the one pictured here is only because I have a trade in the works with a friend (bash away if you must).  But I‚Äôll always replace my bottle of Pipe Dream. Because the first time I poured myself a dram of that,  I had to take a second look to make sure I didn‚Äôt grab the soccer ball bottle by mistake. It‚Äôs that close in proof, nose, taste and finish for me. All the same light nose, baking spice and sweet but short finish but without having to fight off a dude that‚Äôs memorized the truck schedule. Blanton‚Äôs does have the better viscous mouth feel though, I‚Äôll give it that. 

I‚Äôm not going to disparage Blanton‚Äôs. It checks a lot of boxes that bourbon should be. But many, many experienced whiskey guys will tell you they‚Äôve moved on to something more available or just a better overall bourbon. Pipe Dream does at least the first half of that with ease and has a solid argument for the latter. 
","Drink what you like not what Reddit tells you to drink.
Never had blantons but pipe dream is just so good for 29 bucks
Personally I like their emerald giant more
Redwood in general is pretty great. And pipe dream is the least of it.
Even the cask strength versions(which are incredible) are half blantons secondary
I‚Äôm more of a scotch guy, but was given pipe dream for my birthday. I didn‚Äôt dislike it, but it didn‚Äôt impress me either. Other bottles I‚Äôve had recently: ER10 was unoffensive, but maybe a bit boring; OF1920 was pretty good. If I‚Äôm looking to explore bourbon more, what redwood empire bottle should I try next?
I will do my part to sacrifice for my fellow whiskey drinkers and accept all bottles of Blanton‚Äôs. I‚Äôll even dispose of them for free!
Redwood Empire is amazing, I love their emerald giant cask strength. I think they were MGP when they first started years ago but the last few vintages they've done their own distilling.
Pipe Dream is great. It beat out hibiki, eagle rare, and redbreast lustau for me in a blind taste test, which I felt was wild. It's excellent and by far the best thing at its price point. Plus the bottle looks cool.
I just finished my first bottle of Redwood Empire. I have had Blantons, Blantons Single Barrel, and Blantons Straight from Barrel. I loved Redwood Empire Pipe Dream and will definitely try out their other whiskey. I don‚Äôt understand why it has to be either or though? Why not both?  They both taste great and get them if you can. I think Blantons is smoother, sweeter, and has a better mouth feel. Redwood empire had a bit more spice to me. Great whiskey and cool art.
Pipe dream tastes like water to me! Wife liked it but not for me
The day you get your hands on Redwood Empire Pipe Dream CS, this review might be edited differently
Redwood Empire Distillery is doing some very good work.  I haven‚Äôt been disappointed by anything from their selection of whiskey..
Damn!  I just bought Lost Monarch. Is Pipe Dream better?
I'm on board with most of what you said outside the comment of not picking out notes makes it easier to tell ""the emperor isn't wearing clothes"". I don't even know what that is implying. I understand the general meaning of the phrase, but are you saying folks that pick out specific notes can't tell when a bottle is overrated? Being able to pick out notes is usually just tied to life experiences. A certain note just kicks off a memory that is reliably tied to one one thing. Notes will vary but *generally* are in the same categories. Being specific, even oddly specific, doesn't make it any easier or difficult to tell if a bottle is overrated. If that's what you even mean by the phrase.
Drinking Lost Monarch now, have the Grizzly Beast and ED in the pantry ü´° Pipe dream is next on the list. Honestly from a tater. The line up in insane from RE gotta try the cast strengths next time
I‚Äôm in Australia. Blantons is about $140 here and in practically most Dan Murphy stores here, and Pipe Dream is $150 and only available online. I‚Äôll pick the Blantons.
The redwood empire blue bottle was a little too harsh for me from what it looks like this bottle seems to be a much better choice I'll have to check it out after I finish my two current bottles
Excellently written! And I‚Äôd agree just like most here. I have a few tater bottles I hunted down. Thankfully they were msrp because I live in a controlled state. But that makes it even harder to find them. I can say I wasn‚Äôt blown away by any of them after waiting to find them. Only one I‚Äôd say might be worth more than msrp is Stagg Jr. I do like them & thought they were better on the first pour vs the later pours, once the taterness wore off. Redwood is doing some awesome stuff with MGP juice. If you can find a cask strength be sire to grab one. They‚Äôre around $70. But worth a try for sure. Keep in mind Blantons is a single barrel product. So each one will taste different based on the barrel it came from. I have only had one. And it was good. But if they all taste like that I‚Äôd much rather have something cheaper and easier to find.
Both the P.D & E.D Cask Strength‚Äôs are out of this world.
I wholeheartedly agree! I just picked up the cask strength one too and it's awesome!
Ok but why do you have your bottles in what looks like your torture chamber basement?
I just did a blind 16 tasting, Blantons was in the mix along either other allocated and higher end bourbons. Pipe dream won. It‚Äôs the best by a lot ? No. Is it awesome 100% all day.
I actually think Bulleit 10 Year is a very similar taste to Blanton's. I'll have to try this whiskey too.
I have loved redwood empire for a few years now. Get your hands on some barrel-proof if you can. They're cooking something great over there.
You could have at least made it competitive. Pipe Dream is far better than Blantons.
Love the way you are presenting this series. Looking forward to more!
I like the style of your review. Please do more!  How about comparing:

Sagamore Rye Sherry Finished vs MWND

Compass Box Spice Tree vs Yamazaki 12

JW Green vs JW Blue
Thank you for this. Finally someone who I agree with that the allocated stuff just isn‚Äôt that good.
Lol Blantons is better than this young MGP blend. Pipe Dream is very solid for the price and it is definitely refreshing to drink something enjoyable that you don't have to hunt or overpay for, but let's not kid ourselves that it is better. If you compared it to something like Barrel bourbon or Russell's Barrel proof it would be much closer.
$29??? Wow! These are $42+ by me... and I still don't complain. I love it.
Agree. Got got 25 recently on sale. That and lost monarch will never not be on my shelf
Love pipe dreams my new daily
About $30 in St. Louis. Great bottle, love RE
It's better than Blanton's in my opinion.
Haven‚Äôt had Pipe Dream but EG is excellent.
Pipe dream is my least favorite redwood empire offering and I still like it üëç. Emerald giant and Lost Monarch are even better, and their respective Cask Strength versions take it up to greater heights. Then their non-core lineup of Rocket top and Grizzly beast are fantastic. Need to try Foggy Burl and Devils top next.
Yeah‚Ä¶. Pipe Dream is not out performing Blanton‚Äôs. Ever.
Man I have a lost monarch! It‚Äôs absolutely fantastic.
Lost Monarch. Easy decision.
You sound like you might be a fan of single malts, so Foggy Burl is there single malt, but I think their BiB Rocket Top and Grizzly Beast are the best bottles they produce
I will gladly trade mine for redwood empire bottles.
You answered your own question.  ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äù. That‚Äôs the whole point of the post.
This is how I feel about 1910
I've been happy with LM, PD, and Grizzly Beast. That last one is more expensive, but I think it's something special
Both are great and everyone‚Äôs palate is different.  I prefer PD personally.
Haha. That your brain went to that says more about you than me. 

It‚Äôs just the work bench of my highly disorganized garage which is connected to my highly disorganized office where a bunch of my whisky is kept. The work bench was repurposed by the previous he owner. Used to be the kitchen counter tops and cupboards.
I‚Äôm in Vegas and ya it‚Äôs right at 29 for the normal Pipe dream. But have yet to find eagle rare and that in my area
Lost Monarch is a staple. Was getting it for about $35 then the store started selling more of it so the owner upped the price to $59.99.
But EG Cask Strength

Sensational
Not sure why you‚Äôre being downvoted. You‚Äôre entitled to your opinion. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary that it‚Äôs better. They are single barrels. So some might not be up to snuff. I have one that if good for the msrp. But not worth a penny more imho. Redwoods are all very good. I prefer the lost monarch. But I can say this. If I had a choice of either. I‚Äôd probably go with Redwood as well. Easily accessible & just as good for less.
Totally valid opinion. I‚Äôve got some pretty good blantons - takara red, STFB, ive had the black and the gold. The best of it is not that much better than pipe dream- but the rest of redwood outperforms.
Yes it is
Thanks! Will put it in my list.
Agreed on Grizzly Beast.  Big Scotch drinker and this and Pipe Cask are two faves.
I was driving through Kentucky yesterday and stopped at a liquor store. It was $150 a bottle for single barrel Blantons lol. They had  tons of good stuff smoke wagon for $100, Thomas handy for $699. Prices were crazy.  I almost pulled the trigger on Larceny Barrel proof for $100. I probably would have for $70-$80. Complete dump of a liquor store off the interstate too.
I assume you mean Old Forrester 1910, correct? Thanks for input
The hive mind works its ways. I just thought Lost Monarch was pretty boring and also quite youthful tasting. I prefer the fruity notes I get from Blanton‚Äôs. Other offerings from Redwood could certainly stand up to Blanton‚Äôs imo, but this isn‚Äôt one of them"
La Victoire Two Worlds Second Edition,Anyone have any insight on this bottle? I am having a hard time finding any reviews on it other than the distillers notes. ,
How do you think aging my Knob creek maple would turn out? & several other ?'s I want answers to.,"I want to buy one of those 3 liter barrels and try to age some Smoked maple Knob Creek till perfection. Also what other bourbon or Rye do you think would go well blended with the smoked maple if I were to make two batches?

Is there a blended whisky that yall like in comparison to Jack Daniel's Triple Mash? (Not from JD)

I like the baking spice notes in that Triple mash. What is it in the Triple mash that is bringing out those flavors? (Trying to educate myself here as I am extremely new to bourbon.)

What is the equivalent to Michter's Rye?

what should my viewpoint be of my bottle of soft wheated Ben Holiday? what can I expect? I've watched several videos on it already, that's how I got the bottle lol. but what do yall think of it? I'm excited to find a reserve from them. also anyone else subscribed to Brewzle on YouTube?

What has more fruit flavors and less bourbon taste? I like the proof don't get me wrong. I can work through proof in order to taste the product. But I want to taste more fruit in the whisky and from what I hear. That fruit taste comes from when a barrel is toasted not charred.

So is there any bourbon or whisky whatever that is heavy in fruity notes? I know this is such a sissy question.

I do like the Michter's Rye! I held it in my mouth and let the proof go away. Then it was bad tasting for a couple seconds. Then I couldn't stand it so I swallowed it all little bits at a time until it was all gone from my mouth. Then I started tasting very slight bits of spices and other things I don't know the words for yet. But there wasn't much burn to it. And the oak taste wasn't unbearable.

So is there any bottle that tastes lighter than Michter's Rye?

also I would like to try benchmark fullproof. possibly try it with a pinch of the maple Knob Creek. idk I crushed a beer then that came to mind. 

like is it better to just try mixing two bourbon I lile and think will complement each other? instead of aging some in a 3 liter barrel? 

  
I know I'm incredibly new and yall are just gonna tell me to go fuck myself and to taste whatever I can get my hands on. & ur right! but I want minds to bounce these ideas off of. I have no friends hardly and the ones I think I have, I don't really trust and they are making fun of me because of this obsession here lately. I just want social interaction, answers, & meaningful conversations. ","Once the bourbon was dumped from the original barrel at the distillery, the aging process stopped. If those 3 liter barrels actually worked to further age the bourbon, you‚Äôd see everyone using them!  They are just for show, and really nothing more.
Ah ok thank you for the info. Haven't looked up research on it yet. Just drunkards on YT¬†
Why wouldn‚Äôt it age it further?  Heard of double barrel?  They take it from one barrel and put it in another. As long as the 3L barrel is charred it should add additional character to anything you put in it. Now if you put a low alcohol liquid like KC Maple in it, it probably won‚Äôt end well. But a 125 proof whiskey that‚Äôs only been aged a couple years. Sure it‚Äôll do things. Doesn‚Äôt take long to over oak something in these small barrels though.
Instead of a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù mini barrel, consider looking into Ten-30 barrels which can solve a lot of problems like high evaporation rates and over-oaking. Lots of good info over on r/barreling
All I can say is I have two friends who attempted it and the results were abysmal.  The bourbon ended up being worse.  The extra ‚Äúaging‚Äù in the smaller barrels added a bitterness to the bourbon that hadn‚Äôt been there previously."
Need help picking a whiskey to gift my SO?,"Hello! I would like to ask for some help picking a whiskey I want to give as a gift to my SO for our anniversary. Please note that I don't know if there is a wide variety of whiskeys and whiskey brands where I live, so I'm just putting together this list that I know that is within my budget and is available, and the brands I recognize. He likes whiskey, but since it's especially expensive where we are, there's not much experience other than Jack Daniels.



Below are the choices that are within my budget and are available to me. Which of these is a better choice in terms of taste, smoothness, notes? Maybe even what's one that they can have a glass of on the rocks for an achievement? Or, I don't know the word for it in English, to have the most worth for the price? Though it would be better and hurt less on my wallet if it's cheaper. üòÖ I know the first two Jack Daniel's ones are cheaper than the rest, which are really going to stretch me thin. But I also want him to like it and be excited to have a glass when the occasion comes, and also maybe have a new taste for him to enjoy.



* Jack Daniel's Tennessee Straight Rye Whiskey
* Jack Daniel's Gentleman's Jack Whiskey
* Glenfiddich 12 Year Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky
* Glenlivet Founder's Reserve Single Malt Scotch Whisky
* Glenlivet 12 Year Old Single Malt Whisky
* Johnnie Walker Gold Label Reserve Blended Scotch Whisky
* Johnnie Walker Green Label 15 Year Old



Thank you for your help.

Edit: I don't drink. üòÖ I've only ever seen him drink Jack Daniel's though, but that's because of price not because of just taste. I do however, like the smell of Blue Label. It's smells so fruity and nice, but I don't like the taste of liquor in general.

  
edit 2: Thank you for your help!!","From your list, I‚Äôd grab the Johnnie Walker Green. Really good value for what it is. If you want a fancier bottle, get the Gold Label. 

It seems like you aren‚Äôt big hobbyists, and both those options score ‚Äúvery highly‚Äù for the average drinker
Johnnie Walker Gold is really sweet and tastes like honey.  Johnnie Walker Green is also sweet with a hint of peat or smoke.  Glenlivet 12 is sweet with a vanilla taste.  Glenfiddich 12 is smooth with apple/pear notes but it is less flavorful.  I'm not familiar with the other choices.
If your only experience is Jack Daniels, then Scotch whiskeys are a rather different beast. You may want to consider staying in the bourbon/American whiskey type category until you know what you like.

I'm a lifelong American whiskey fan of all types. I can appreciate the craft of Scotch whiskeys, but I don't really enjoy them. Too much peat for me!"
A question on Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,"I had a pour at a bar a couple of months ago and I loved it. It was the biggest green apple note I have ever tasted in a whiskey. I ordered a pour yesterday at a different bar and it had no green apple at all. In addition, there was peat which I don‚Äôt mind but I do not remember any peat in my original pour. I was outside so I did not see them pour my whiskey. Did they serve me the wrong whiskey? Are there any other whiskeys that have a strong green apple note?","I don‚Äôt think I recall a green apple note in Taketsuru but it‚Äôs been a minute. Also, it can vary on what you were eating/drinking before hand. And Taketsuru is possibly my favorite Nikka for reference.
I don‚Äôt think Taketsuru has a green apple note and it should have light peat. I think you were served the wrong whiskey the first time. 

I personally get big green apple notes from Writer‚Äôs Tears whiskey.
Maybe you got the miyagikyo instead of Taketsuru,  miyagikyo don‚Äôt have any peat note, but even with miyagikyo, I don‚Äôt recall heavy apple note. More of a pear note."
Made a swing through part of the Tennessee Whiskey Trail,"Had to be in Chattanooga for a conference Thursday/Friday.  So I looked at the Whiskey Trail map and planned a trip.  A quick summary with a note on each place.

Wed
Big Machine Distilling.  Looks like a super fun place to work.  My tour guide jumped in on what looked like employee pickle ball as I was leaving.  Bottled my own Clayton James.

Pritchard‚Äôs Distilling.  Took a wrong turn and Waze rerouted me easy enough‚Ä¶ onto a one lane gravel road with trees over reaching.  If it was night; it‚Äôd be straight out of Icabod Crane!

Jack Daniel‚Äôs.  Met a buddy from college.  It‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôd expect from a large commercial place.  They were top notch all around.  Grabbed a Distillery only bottle while there.

Thur
Nearest Green.  They have a great story to tell.  They have co-opted some great history and tell a story worthy of the California movie execs that own the place.  Our guide Xavier was great and you could tell he was passionate.

George Dickel.  Nice smaller place.

Fri
Chattanooga Whiskey. Your was fine.  Gotta say‚Ä¶ the tasting was pretty great.  Six pours and then basically poured anything else they had on hand.  Good thing I walked from the hotel!

Sat
Leipers Fork.  Nice smaller place outside Franklin.  Lot of families just hanging out.

Company.  Used to be HClark.  No tours.  Just tasting.  It was fine.

Short Mountain.  Two dudes.  Super passionate about their work.  Geeked out and talked organic chemistry with the head distiller.

Overall was a great trip.

","How was the Ancient Wheat? Think it came out Friday and I‚Äôve been interested to hear more about it, thinking of making the drive down for some.
That was the first day it released.  It was one of the things they just let me taste in addition to the scheduled selection.  It was good.  A very nice finish to it.
Nice, love everything I‚Äôve had from Chatt
I have a friend that went for a tasting a few years ago, and he was telling me how much he liked their 111 cask strength.  So I made sure to grab a bottle to take him.  I‚Äôd never had any of their stuff, they had some unique offerings.  One in the tasting was a botanical that really tasted like Jager.  Wasn‚Äôt a fan, but I can appreciate the experimentation they put into their work."
Reviews #8 and #9: RedBreast Tawny Port Cask and Gold Spot 13 Year,"For Saint Patrick‚Äôs Day, it seemed appropriate to review a couple recently released single pot still Irish Whiskies. First up is Redbreast Tawny Port Cask Edition, which is part of their Iberian Series, and next is Gold Spot 13 Generations Edition. Both start with Midleton distillate, which is then matured in bourbon and sherry casks and finished in wine casks. Given their similar maturation and identical proofs, it seemed like it would be interesting to compare the two.
 
Redbreast Tawny Port Cask 

Distiller: Midleton

Maturation: ‚ÄúMatured in bourbon and oloroso sherry casks before being recasked into delectable tawny port hogsheads‚Äù

Age: NAS

ABV: 46%

Tasting Notes

Nose: Buttered bread, vanilla, waxy nuts, and some sweet berries from the port.

Palate: More berries and vanilla, some nuttiness, like a raspberry bar. Light oak.

Finish: Medium/short. More vanilla and oak after berry sweetness subsides.


Gold Spot 13

Distiller: Also Midleton

Maturation: ‚ÄúMatured initially in ex-bourbon and sherry casks before being finished for 16 months in Recioto della Valpolicella Italian wine casks‚Äù

Age: 13 years old

ABV: 46%

Tasting Notes

Nose: Sweet berries (blueberry and maybe strawberry), toasted oak and vanilla. The influence from the bourbon casks is noticeable. I also get honey, granola, clove and allspice.

Palate: Similar to the nose. Mixed berry pie, honey, oak and vanilla.

Finish: Medium/long. Honey sweetness fades, leaving behind oak, vanilla, and blueberry.

Thoughts

These are two excellent whiskies, and quite similar, which I suppose is not surprising given the similar maturation employed. The main difference is the presence of the nuttiness in the Redbreast, which is typical of that brand. The Gold Spot separated itself by having more complexity from the oak tannins and spice, as well as the longer finish. The wine finish also felt slightly more prominent on the Gold Spot. It is hard to say whether the extra oak influence comes from increased age (13 years vs. non-age stated), or from better cask selection. The Gold Spot is more expensive, so probably that should be expected, but the Redbreast lacks a bit of punch in comparison.

Ratings: Redbreast - 7.8/10. Gold Spot 13 - 9.0/10.","Would you recommend that Gold Spot? I'm debating it, but the price is a bit beyond what I'm usually comfortable with.
Hmm that is a tough question to answer. I like it more than blue spot and maybe slightly more than red (although I think that could change with a given day/mood). But, given the way Spot and Irish prices in general are going in the US the price from the distiller isn't the craziest thing out there. In a vacuum is it fair value for money, maybe not compared to standard Redbreast offerings (12, CS). But I like this much better than their middle range offerings (15, Tawny Port), so from that perspective, yes. And I probably had some FOMO from missing out on the 9 year gold spot, so I'm definitely happy to have the bottle, even if it was a bit of a splurge. It's something I plan to nurse and enjoy for a long time."

I've been meaning to write a review for this bottle for a while now. I won't go into a huge amount of detail, but this is a truly special drink. Probably the best scotch I've ever had, mostly because it hits a great sweet spot for me between sherry sweetness and the robust flavours you get from higher ABV whisky. I normally discount quite heavily the first few drinks I get from a new bottle and wait until I'm past the neck until I do a proper review. So here you are!

ABV: 55.8%

* Nose: dried fruits (dates and raisins, particularly), candied oranges and orange peel, Christmas spices.
* Palate: more of the same, but with honey coming through. I also get some chocolate notes and more waxy orange peel. Figs and more dates lurk in the background. I can feel the ABV lifting the flavour profile but it's in no way overpowering. Just magically put together.
* Finish: long, in a word. Treacly sweetness that sits with you for a while. No need to go anywhere.

Rating: 4.95/5

This is truly phenomenal stuff and I can't recommend it highly enough if you like sherried scotches. Normally I wouldn't want these as an everyday drinker. Not the case here. I won't need much of an excuse to pour this for myself. Cheers!",Edradour (and the peated equivalent Ballechin) are putting out some very very special bottles that are flying under the radar. Their sherry cask stuff is everything Macallan want to be just now and their peated is putting many Islay‚Äôs to shame.
"Had this down at SPI last week. On the front label, it says; ""Texas Made"", but the back label doesn't jive with that claim. It's not bad, but wonder who actually distelled it? Anyone ever try or hear of 1835? Cheers to Friday!",,"You can safely assume it's Barton distillate.¬†
It‚Äôs likely distilled by Buffalo Trace. ‚Äú88004‚Äù on the UPC is know to be used by them. It says ‚ÄúDistilled in Kentucky‚Äù and while that‚Äôs fairly ambiguous, it aligns with the UPC. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything that would prohibit the brand from putting ‚ÄúTexas Made‚Äù on the label, however it is quite deceiving. It looks like they are an NDP who bought young Buffalo Trace distillate and bottled it in Texas. The lack of ‚ÄúStraight [Insert State] Bourbon Whiskey‚Äù doesn‚Äôt give any actual insight as to where it was aged, but the lack of ‚ÄúStraight‚Äù designation indicates it‚Äôs very young."

For this installment, I have three bottles:

# Old Forester Single Barrel Bourbon Barrel Strength

Well damn. This one has a really nice spice to it. An incredibly inviting aroma, the 132.4 proof will have swift words with you if you‚Äôre not careful. This is the first higher-proof bourbon I have tried. I like it. It‚Äôs complex. Way more complex than I would‚Äôve guessed for something that is two-thirds alcohol. I found this to be incredibly enjoyable. Worth the money and something that forces you to drink slowly and enjoy.

**Rating: 4.0**

# Bowmore 15 Year

This was the whisky that got me into whisky- a Christmas gift that had me asking ‚Äúis this what good whisky tastes like?‚Äù You open the bottle, and I swear bagpipes play in the distance. The smokiness hits you before anything else. Peaty and smoky. Transporting me into the wild- it‚Äôs difficult to describe, but this digs up some sort of deep memory of camping in the Scottish Highlands (and I‚Äôve never been to Scotland). Something that I really want to love. I am enjoying the finish more than anything else. The bottle states, ‚ÄúAn exquisite SHERRY CASK FINISH that develops layers of RICH, PEAT SMOKED complexity.‚Äù I agree with all of that. I dig it. It‚Äôs a trip.

**Rating: 4.1**

# Hibiki Japanese Harmony

This is the first Japanese whisky I‚Äôve ever tried. Love it. It‚Äôs light and complex; it feels ‚Äúnew.‚Äù I must admit, I read several reviews for this one before trying. Reviews mentioned notes of ‚Äúfloral,‚Äù ‚Äúoak,‚Äù ‚Äúcandied fruits,‚Äù ‚Äúhoney,‚Äù and ‚Äúsherry.‚Äù  Sweet herbal. It's almost like a light maple syrup with an oak finish. It‚Äôs delicious. This makes me want to explore more Japanese whiskies.

**Rating: 4.1**

1. Hibiki Japanese Harmony
2. Bowman 15 Year

Another day another buffalo trace post,"I live in a small area and this is the first time I've came across a buffalo trace single barrel($45 they were proud of it I guess). I like buffalo trace but I wouldn't pay more then $25 for it ""normally"".
That being said I scooped up a bottle and figured I'd compare it to the blended tater juice. It's definitely more pleasant on the nose, I can pick out the sweet notes easier and it's more complex. Kinda reminds me of honeysuckle from when I was a kid. As far as taste it's much better on the pallette, I can pick up on the fruits and vanilla much easier and the oak is more distinguished. All in all I'm happy with the purchase. Would  I pay $45 again? Probably not but it's definitely worth it for a first time purchase. Sorry if my comparison is lack luster, I'm not much of a connoisseur more of a consuming enthusiast.","I have a few picks of BT and the regular bottle. I need to blind them. The one pick I have opened definitely has an edge in a good way. But at 90 proof, it can be a bit harder to tell than blinding barrel proof offerings
I'm a barrel proof guy all day, I agree that it's hard to tell the differences the lower you go but it's pretty dang easy with the barrel pick I have. It's nothing to write home about but it will make a good conversation piece amongst my 100 other conversation pieces I have on the shelf lol. I really need to blind my 1792 bib, I got 3 different barrel picks and 1 OG non barrel pick. That's definitely one of my favorite everyday pours."

Hey Whiskey Enthusiasts!

I've recently been curating my whiskey collection and would love to hear your thoughts and opinions. Here's what I've got so far:

- Eagle Rare
- Town Branch Single Barrel Select
- Basil Hayden Small Batch
- Four Roses Single Barrel (a bit left)
- Oban 14

Was a gift from my father in law this year in Feb for my birthday. He said he grabed it around Christmas
nice, solid collection."
Pappy van Winkel 15 - notes,"I‚Äôm in San Francisco for work and decided to drop into a bar for a quick drink. A bottle of Pappy 15 on the shelf caught my eye, so I decided to have a pour. I don‚Äôt have any involved tasting notes. Needless to say, this is a very good bourbon.

Nose - dates, orange peel, toffee, other dried fruit
Palate - I get toffee, a bit of briny funkiness, brown sugar, and more dried fruit. Finally a bit of spice that I can‚Äôt really place
Finish - long, in a word. I‚Äôm still sitting with this an hour later. I can still taste the booze-soaked dates and some light toffee

I loved this, and would recommend it to anyone who wants something a bit special. I drink quite a lot of scotch and would probably liken Pappy 15‚Äôs taste profile to Edradour 21.

I paid quite a bit (225+ tip for the generous pour I received), but I‚Äôm fortunate in that this sort of outlay for a casual drink isn‚Äôt a problem for me. 

Review - 4.7/5","Thanks for this post.  It is sort of nice to be able to live vicariously though the experiences of others and your review was outstanding.  I write this under the glow of an evening of Irish whiskeys ending with some Green Spot... and probably will never be able afford to enjoy your pour this evening. 

Thanks for sharing!
Winkel
I hope you enjoyed your drink - that‚Äôs the main point of this all!
Quite right! I live in Amsterdam and I‚Äôm used to seeing Winkel (Dutch for ‚Äúshop‚Äù).
It surely is!  Do you think it is really worth all the hype... the van Winkles that is?   I've considered stepping up for something truly epic, but worry about being disappointed.   It's not so much a money thing for me, as it is a feel of being mislead by reviews.  Maybe my tastebuds are not refined enough maybe?   Anyhow... cheers!  (raises a glass)
It‚Äôs hard for me to say, and I‚Äôve only had the 15 yr. Ultimately there‚Äôs a ceiling to how good any food or drink can be (at least to me). Beyond a certain point you‚Äôre paying for hype, scarcity, or a very unusual flavor profile. If you have the ‚Äòfun money‚Äô for this sort of purchase to make sense then go for it, but it‚Äôs not transcendental or anything. It‚Äôs just a very well put-together drink that is a nice supplement to life‚Äôs other experiences.
My advice, having had a few unicorn whiskies like this is that the following things tend to elevate the quality of a drinking session, putting it into the category of a memorable life experience:

- Drinking with good friends, especially if they also enjoy whiskies.

- Exploring a variety of whisky flavor profiles finding those which are especially well-tuned to your personal tastes & preferences, and then hitting a top class premium example of the specific subgenre which most appeals to your tastes.

- Finding a whiskey which dramatically over-performs its price in terms of drinking quality, leaving you feeling like it was a steal.

In the case of the Van Winkle bourbons, that last category is obviously not on the menu. The first two factors are very much in play. What I'll say in favor of the PVW 15 is that it does a great job of showcasing what wheated bourbons are justifiably (IMHO and to my taste) famous for, which is that they age gracefully - with good barrel selection you get a lot of complexity in the bourbon without it being overly tannic in flavor. 

I think this style is extremely well suited to people with broad tastes who like a variety of different drinks and not necessarily just bourbons - the celebrity chefs who help to publicize the PVW range in the early days of Pappy Mania are a good example of such.

This is a more subtle style of whiskey than some of the *punch you in the face* flavor bombs which can be found in barrel proof bourbon - for the latter at a reasonable price you might be better off with something like Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, or one of the older (in years of maturation) Russell's Reserve Single Barrel or Knob Creek Single Barrel store picks.

If you like wheated mashbill bourbons specifically and are fine with drinking them at a younger age with less complexity, but at high proof, then I rec the Maker's Mark limited editions and Private Selection store pick single barrels which are pretty easy to find and very affordable by the standards of today's marketplace.

Hope that helps, good luck
I came to the same conclusion with wine. Generally speaking, quality basically tops out at 200 to 300 for bordeaux/napa.  There are a few bottles that are very unique around 1k+, but I can't say I enjoyed those more."
1920 Thoughts,"After researching the recommendations y'all have I went with the 1920. They only wanted 12 bucks for the decanter so I figured why not. 

As someone new to bourbon, this one shattered my mind. I had heard about the complexities of whiskeys before, but had never really experienced them. I had no idea I would actually get so many different scents and flavors. 

The nose has a tiny bit of caramel, some vanilla, banana, chocolate, marshmallow, and a bready note. The palate have me a big hit of chocolate at the beginning, with marshmallow and banana. The finish has the marshmallow and chocolate linger, followed by a bready taste like on the nose. 

At 115 proof it is remarkably smooth. Barely felt any burn and what is there lingers giving a very good warm feeling in the throat. It's very thick which I absolutely love, and the legs in my glencairn eye very uniform. The color is tremendous as well. 

My local store wanted 64.99 for the bottle which isn't a terrible markup, though I would have liked to save the five dollars by going to Spec's. But I always want to support local if I can. The 1920 is definitely worth the money, and may be my go-to from now on. ","This is a solid every day sipper you can‚Äôt go wrong with it. It‚Äôs great to put in a decanter and just have available for you at any time. 1920 has great nose, a great pallet and anyone who likes whiskey will think this is enjoyable.
Just a heads up about decanters. They are meant for short term storage/serving purposes (think of a fancy dinner party or gathering). They are not designed for storing whiskey more than a day or two. The glass stopper tends to form a relatively imperfect seal and allows for significant evaporation and air exchange when compared to a properly corked/capped bottle. There is an exception in that adding grease to the stopper/neck will allow for an airtight seal, but nobody wants grease in their whiskey! 

In any case, glad to hear you enjoy the 1920, it‚Äôs a solid bottle. Cheers!
Definitely get the 1910 also. I actually have a decanter with a special blend of both 1910/1920 thats amazing if you‚Äôre fan of both it‚Äôs known as a 1915.
If I could only ever have one bottle of whiskey for the rest of my life, I‚Äôd take the 1920. It‚Äôs widely available, good proof, but not so high proof that it will kill a newbie if I‚Äôm sharing it, and it‚Äôs just damn good.
Yeah it's all downhill from here. Either harder to find pointlessly, impossible to find, or just nowhere near as good.

If you see Jack Daniels Single Barrel Barrel Proof, esp. a store pick though, that'll maybe give 1920 a run for its money.
I found it to have a spicy cherry flavor, almost akin to cherry Dr Pepper. Very good whiskey! Got it on my shelf now. 

Like others have mentioned, you gotta try 1910. Delicious! Very similar to the Woodford Reserve Double Oaked, which is my staple whiskey.
1920 is solid. Even better the 2nd, 3rd day. I need a new bottle to blind taste against a couple single barrel bottles. Along the same price point I think putting it up against Elijah and Larceny single barrels would be interesting.
I enjoyed it. Keep an eye out on that proof though. It sneaks up on ya ü•É
Definitely a fan of this one. Super smooth. I have only tried it neat so far. Temping to try it with a splash of water or on the rocks
That‚Äôs pretty much the going rate here where I live and it‚Äôs worth every penny. It‚Äôs my favorite so far.
I really like it. I got a nice maple syrup vibe from it, along with some of the other notes you gave.
pretty much always wind up going back to this one. its perfectly well rounded for me
Always keep on hand.
Wow! An actual review of a bottle instead of asking everyone else what they think. This is an incredible day for r/whiskey
I like putting any of my higher proof stuff in decanters. Nice decanter by the way AND you've sold me. My next bottle will probably be a OF 1920 üòÇ
Love this one! When I first opened it, I got like a fermented sourdough note. And to me the palate is all chocolate cherries. Never had chocolate flavors in bourbon before this one! So good!!
Not my jam. I don‚Äôt like dark chocolate and that was very prominent to me. I couldn‚Äôt even after 2 drinks of it. Ended up giving to a buddy who does like dark chocolate so it was perfect for him as a fellow bourbon head
Definitely one of my favorites
So how are you supposed to store whiskey? If you have a normal screw on bottle would it change the whiskey?
Also - crystal decanters are super dangerous for long term storage of any liquid. Crystal is literally leaded glass, and when liquid sits in crystal for a long period of time, the lead leaches into the liquid. Lead poisoning is no fun.
Man, the store sites have Buffalo Race regularly, and they have antique weller in the case for 200 a piece. I've heard good things about each of them but I'm not paying 200 for a bottle. Is the Buffalo Trace not as good? I know everyone's palate is different but there is usually a consensus.
I would say to keep it in the bottle it comes in. Store it upright on a sturdy shelf, out of sunlight / UV light and between 60-70 degrees F. If it is a natural cork you'll want to gently tip it occasionally so that the cork doesn't dry out. When a cork gets dry it can shrink and compromise the seal. This is especially important with bottles that have larger corks, which will undergo more dramatic shrinkage (e.g., Old Grand Dad 114).  A lot of people will just tip a bottle whenever it's been sitting for a couple weeks or more or whenever/before they go to open that bottle.

If it is a screw-top bottle or an artificial cork (e.g., Knob Creek) then tipping the bottle/wetting the cork isn't really necessary.
You do realize that OLD crystal was made with lead. New crystal is lead free. A simple Google search for the brand in the picture with ""lead"" will pull up a resulte that it is lead free.
You all fucking suck. No reason a comment like mine deserved 10 downvotes. Nothing I said is untrue - the only caveat being that newer crystal often doesn‚Äôt contain lead. It still can. Better to just store your whiskey in 100% American made glass. Fuck yourselves.
Normal Buffalo Trace is fantastic for Whiskey Sours and Paper Plane cocktails. It's not really a sipper if you ask me, though you can. Buffalo Trace products, like Old Forester, don't have a lot of ""nut"" flavors to them, unlike Heaven Hill, Jack Daniels, Wild Turkey et al. So they're similar in that way. I find Old Forrester is a little less corn-y than Buffalo Trace and a little more medicinal.

I've never had Weller Antique but I've heard good things. I'd probably shell out the 200$ to try it because it's so hard to find here had I the chance.
Good to know! Didn‚Äôt realize that
You need to calm the hell down kid. You spread misinformation, you got downvoted. Control yourself or get the fuck off my post.
It‚Äôs not worth $200. Markers mark cask strength is just as good for $47. Larceny Barrel proof is even better than 107
Be a little careful. They‚Äôre right that a lot of new crystal is lead free, but a significant portion is still leaded. Always check to make sure you‚Äôre getting unleaded before you buy if you want unleaded.
Misinformation lmao that‚Äôs so fucking dramatic.
My comment is 100% accurate for old decanters. Someone else pointed out that new decanters don‚Äôt contain lead, and someone else corrected THEM by pointing out that some do. I thanked the first person for providing an amendment to my comment. The fact is that SOME decanters do contain lead. I wasn‚Äôt attacking you for using one. Makes zero sense that people jumped on my comment when I was being completely cordial. Toxic af community.
Oh except you plainly said that all decanters are lead when they're not now. The only toxic thing here is you."
Single Barrel Hazmat Bourbon from Boulder Spirits - Review,"First Single Barrel offering I‚Äôve seen from Boulder Spirits and it‚Äôs also the first Hazmat/Cask Strength Bourbon I‚Äôve seen that is also reasonably priced ($70). Six years is not a super impressive age statement, but the high temp variations and dry climate in CO tend to speed up the aging process of whiskey, so I would say this is more on par with a 10-15 year old whiskey. It definitely doesn‚Äôt suffer from ‚Äúyoung‚Äù tasting notes. 

It has a very nice nose that reminds me a bit of Old Forester, in that I catch a strong note of ripe banana. The high malted barley mashbill comes through strong on the palate, still a pretty heavy banana influence too. I also get some nice charred oak. For how high the alcohol content is, it‚Äôs still very drinkable. It isn‚Äôt super viscous but it coats the mouth well and delivers a pretty strong kick of flavor and heat.

The finish is long and provides more oak and banana. It is accompanied by a very warm and lasting whiskey hug.

I‚Äôve also had the standard barrel proof offering from Boulder Spirits (67.6% ABV) and it is fairly similar. So I recommend getting it if you can find it at $80 or below.

Overall and after a small tasting, I‚Äôd give this particular single barrel an 8.5/10. It‚Äôs great and an easy buy at $70

Cheers!","Why are you hiding part of the label?   

Nice review too, enjoy the rest :-)
Nice review
Nice! Wish I could get this shipped to ny been looking for a tasty reasonably priced hazmat
I‚Äôve had their standard offering (135.2 proof). Definitely agree it drinks like a much older bourbon minus the mouth feel. Great pour!
Thanks!"
Shanghai/Tokyo haul,"The end of my business trip yielded two fun layovers and two unique bottles. 

First was in Shanghai, there was a Kavalan tasting room a few blocks from my hotel, I was able to sample the Ex-Bourbon (pictured), Oloroso Sherry, Port wine and a couple others. The ex-bourbon had such a great texture and finish, it was an easy choice.

Second was an evening and AM layover in Tokyo. I went to a mall near the hotel to get some souvenirs for my boys and while passing through the market before the mall, I found a Takara Black. Check, I‚Äôm done. And yes, I still loaded up on goodies for the boys üòâ

I did sample the Blantons when I got home, the 80p is really nice, while I do prefer higher proof points, I‚Äôve got to say, this works. It reminds me  more of Eagle Rare than Blantons at 80, no issues there, and is a welcomed addition to my selection. As far as tasting notes go, I‚Äôm terrible but I will say I get more of the cherry specifically in the Black than I do with the regular which I mostly identify as a general fruitiness and is why it reminds me of ER more and that‚Äôs also my favorite note in the SFTB that I have, which is superb.

Cheers to the week boys! ü•É","Excellent picks! Kavalan is my favorite world whisky. I got major notes of coconut, guava, and lychee from that ex-bourbon solist. Enjoy!

MASSIVE BEGINNER - I have a couple of questions,"Hello Whiskey community ! 
After doing a good amount of research I think I understand the basic gist of whiskey and a lot of the information that goes along with it. 

I am still left with a couple of questions that I can‚Äôt seem to find a good enough answer to-please have mercy on me as I really am curious about this and would like to know more about this interesting hobby that so many of you share 

Please correct me if any of the terms I‚Äôm using are incorrect or if I‚Äôm using any terms incorrectly!
 

What is the relationship between type of malt whether it be single malt, single grain, and  blended, and flavor ? 

Is there really a notable difference between bourbon and scotch or is it more dependent on the specific type of whiskey? 

Does color have an effect on a whiskeys overall tastes?


Bonus question:
I‚Äôm currently located in the USA , and I am looking for a whiskey that is suitable for beginners that is smooth, sweet, and has apple, caramel, vanilla , notes
Price shouldn‚Äôt be too much of an issue as long as it isn‚Äôt absurdly high (100+ USD for me is my limit) 
Any suggestions ? I would love to hear what you guys have to say ! 

Also like I said  feel free to correct me on anything I may have said incorrectly. thanks! ","There is a huge difference in flavour between scotch and bourbon.

Bourbon is made up of: corn, barley and rye.

Scotch is usually made from only malted barley. 

Bourbon must be aged in a newly charred American white oak barrel. 

Scotch can be aged in any barrel so long as it is oak. Sherry, Madeira, Port, Manzanilla, Stout... whatever.

Bourbon is matured in rickhouses, and, typically, has a far, far warmer climate to mature in. Bourbon matures more rapidly than scotch because the spirit is squeezed in and out of the barrel through the hot Kentucky summers.

Scotch is matured in dunnage warehouses, which are very cold and the spirit can age for far longer than bourbon can without becoming overpowering with wood (or evaporating- This is called ""The Angel's share"")

Colour makes no difference. In Scotch, they can artificially colour the spirit. If it is natural colour, it is only indicative of what casks are used; a sherry cask will impart a red mahogany colour, whereas ex- rum casks or ex-bourbon casks will impart a golden like colour. The flavour comes down to how active the casks were, quality of the casks and whether it is a first, second or refill cask.

Eagle Rare 10 is your friend. Its a very sweet, mellow and approachable bourbon. It may be allocated, in that case go for Elijah Craig Small Batch.

Balvenie 14 Caribbean Cask is a very sweet and light scotch whisky
The best to start with is probably Woodford Reserve Double Oaked. Its very smooth, sweet, and widely available
> What is the relationship between type of malt whether it be single malt, single grain, and blended, and flavor ?

So, it isn't ""Single Malt"" and ""Single Grain"". It is ""Single"" meaning from 1 distillery. ""Malt"" meaning made from Malted Barley. ""Grain"" is malted grain (can also have corn, rye, etc). 

Blended whiskey is a mix of whiskies from different distilleries, blended together. 

> Is there really a notable difference between bourbon and scotch or is it more dependent on the specific type of whiskey

Bourbon and Scotch are different types of Whiskey. Whiskey is a loose term for liquor made from malted grain (barley, corn, rye, wheat). Bourbon is made exclusively in the USA and has some specific rules around how it is made, scotch is made exclusively in Scotland and also has specific rules.

> Does color have an effect on a whiskeys overall tastes?

Maybe.  Some whiskey gets colour from the barrel. The barrel has massive influence on taste. Some distilleries add colour to the whiskey and this may or may not affect taste."
Blind taste,"Blind tasting for the wife and I tonight. Cut to the chase with the winners
Wife:
1 Blantons
2 Larceny
3 Elijah 
Myself:
1 Larceny
2 Elijah 
3 Blantons
A few notes. A newly opened bottle never tastes the same after the first day. It always tastes better. For me, the Elijah was easy to pick out because this is the second day. I‚Äôm sure it will be even better tomorrow night. For my amateur pallet, tomorrow it may be hard to tell it from the Larceny. As far as Blantons goes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.i like this bottle. A lot. It doesn‚Äôt carry the proof that I would look for in a single barrel offering and because of that it easily stood out in this blind. But for some nights, when I don‚Äôt want proof, this bottle is very enjoyable. Less proof but with more complexity and viscosity than a small batch offering. 
",
Shanghai/Tokyo,"The end of my business trip in Taixing provided two layovers and n Shanghai and Tokyo. While I wasn‚Äôt able to super hunt I did manage a bottle of Kavalan and Blantons Takara Black. Very excited for both. 

While I‚Äôm trash at tasting notes I will say that at 80p, this Blantons is deliciously strangely tastes closer to Eagle Rare than blantons. I don‚Äôt know, it delicious. I‚Äôll open that Kavalan in a couple days, sharing with friends will commence soon.

Is the Balvenie 14 Caribbean Rum worth it?,"It‚Äôs quite expensive but the described taste and experience is what I‚Äôm looking for so I‚Äôll buy it if it‚Äôs truly worth it. If there are any other cheaper whiskeys I could start with, my preferences for whiskey is slightly creamy, with notes of caramel and vanilla",">It‚Äôs quite expensive

This is one of my yardsticks when I walk into a new store. If they have it <$90, I consider that a good sign. I've seen it going for $110 or more in some places.

That said, I wouldn't pay over $90 and Balvenie 14 is my favorite scotch.
I'm usually not much of a scotch but this one is pretty good and worth the price to me.
Has been one of my favorites for years, I just wish it was still 60 bucks.
I prefer bourbon, and this is one of my favorite scotches. I got my bottle from Costco for about $80, but would probably still buy if it‚Äôs less than $100. Maybe try a pour at a bar to see how you like it?
I‚Äôm a bourbon guy, and I think this is a fantastic scotch. I picked it up from Costco for 80-90 can‚Äôt remember, but definitely worth it! Would buy again
No
If you are a Bourbon Guy, this could be a good choice. Usually scotch is stored in cherry barrels. The Balvenie 14 Carribean is stored in american oak barrels, so this will probably fit your taste and this Whiskey tastes strongly like exotic fruits. In my opinion, this is a very good bottle.
Do you mean <$90 ?
Scotch isn't normally stored in ex sherry casks, it is sometimes and it is sometimes finished in them for a few months but for the most part they're aged in ex bourbon or virgin oak casks.
Thanks for catching that! I did, and corrected my comment.
After doing some research about my knowledge i can confirm your right. Ex Bourbon is mostly used for scotch and sherry is on second place, at least that's what 3 different websites said. Thanks for clarifying."
Now I get it..,"Start off by saying that this of course isn't a review and I'm new to the nerdy bourbon side, up until this first pour of this JD SBBP Rye I have thought that I wasn't a fan of high proofers. Loved some around the 105-115 range but had an ECBP that just felt like fire and wrote off anything that high.

With that being said this taste and being only the first pour has been a complete WOW! This was so eye opening I felt the need to make a post.

Was able to find one of these after seeing all the reviews and decided to crack it tonight to get that high proof poor done and the bottle ""airing out"" started. All I have to say is wow, the taste and finish of this is incredible and drinks just like anything else l've had if not easier than some of my favorite sub 115 pours. The finish is just incredible with a great rye spice, and sort of minty-ness.

Has definitely made me want to explore some higher proof options and very excited to see how this bottle opens up. With that said, thanks for reading and have a great week everyone!","does that say 124.9 or 134.9?
It‚Äôs a Rye, not bourbon. And it‚Äôs fantastic. It was plentiful here for a while but now has disappeared. Enjoy and personally if you like I would back it up if possible

134.9
Yea, sorry was some copy pasta from the similar post I made to r/bourbon and realized I left that in there. Can‚Äôt edit for some reason so it‚Äôs stuck.

Tried to find the highest proof they had! Warmed up the palate before hand with a pour of Souther Star Paragon Cask strength (113.6) or so. 

This arguably drank like it was lower proof than that!"
Review #1,"Decided to do my first tasting on here. 

Nose: Peach

Palate: Peach

Finish: Peach

At 70 proof this whisky shows nothing but it‚Äôs flavor, providing absolutely nothing but peach notes. 

Please delete if not allowed, thought it‚Äôd be funny for the group. ",I‚Äôd say your post is just peachy!
Battle of the Wheaters,"Battle of the Wheaters

Decided to grab a few of my favorite Wheaters on this fine Saturday for a battle royale. All tastes neat in a glen after 10-15 minutes. 

I didn‚Äôt blind it this time, but will consider in the future to avoid bias. 


Nose Rank:
1: Holladay - a soft & inviting nose, gives the impression that a smooth sip is coming. 
2: OWA - soft, but a little more oomf. Maybe from the slightly higher proof? Still inviting. 
3: MM46CS - a bit of an ethanol smell on this one. Definitely the most ‚Äúin your face‚Äù nose. 

Palate Rank:
1: OWA - warm, gives an immediate fruit flavor that has me wanting another sip. 
2: Holladay - warm, fills your mouth but slightly less oomph than OWA
3: MM46CS - can pull out the oak and brown sugar easily, definitely no burn but easily sense the ethanol

Finish Rank:
1: Holladay - super soft to end, it lingers in the best way with no burn. 
2: OWA - the warm taste continues, gives a hint of a burn without a burn. 
3: MM46CS - leaves the softest burn, I honestly would normally appreciate this subtle burn but compared to the others, is a touch less appealing. 

Final Rank: 
1: Holladay 
2: OWA 
3: MM46CS 

Final Thoughts:

This is my first formal review & is fun to pick out the differences! If not comparing so closely, I would be very happy to receive a pour of any of these. 

These are three of my favorites overall (that are semi-readily available) & all are worth having around! 

How would you rank these 3?

","Probably the same. Holladay makes great stuff. OWA secondary is wild and I believe it‚Äôs only worth it at MSRP. I‚Äôve become not as much of a fan of Makers although the Cellar Aged is amazing
107 is my favorite wheater of all time"
Infinity jug spreadsheet,"Hello All,

I had done a project all last year where I had created an infinity jug. After writing down each of the bourbons and amounts, I decided I wanted to get as granular as possible with what was inside. I ended up creating a spreadsheet that tracked and calculated amount, ABV, tasting notes, mash bill (where applicable obviously), and most importantly the spreadsheet had the weighted amount attached to each ( 300ml of a 90proof that‚Äôs 80/20 on mash affects the breakdown far more than 50ml of 115 proof that‚Äôs 60/40 mash)


Would anybody be interested in using this spreadsheet for your infinity jug projects? ","Interesting. I‚Äôve just been using whiskey shelf app for similar result.
Share away please."
Tasting Tuesday Barrell Whiskey ,"Barrel Private Release c501
- blend of Irish whiskeys finished in Spanish brandy casks
Proof: 130.1
Price: 64.99
Age: N/A

I decided to drive down to barrell's retail store in Louisville today. I am a huge fan of barrell especially their rum blends. I had gone there in the hopes to find another bottle of rum but alas no luck. However, they had tons of single barrels and private releases at great prices. Even the standard offerings like seagrass and vantage were $65. Way cheaper than anywhere else I see it for sure. This was the last bottle and for a $65 130 proof Irish whiskey blend I was in! I love Redbreast cask and wanted to see how this would stack up.

I did this tastings 2 ways neat and with water...
Rested 10-15 in a Glencairn glass 
Color: golden Straw

Neat
- Nose: proof hits you for sure, no way denying its high abv. But then I'm immediately hit with notes of dried fruit like pear and leather. Swishing the glass it then transitions to honey suckle with a faint hint of malted barley. The pear note for me sticks out the most!

Taste: lots of dried fruit! Tastes like one of those leather fruit sticks. I'm hit with a subtle taste of oak but the predominant second flavor is pepper spice. This doesn't feel dry and really coats my tounge.

Finish: the proof lasts for a few seconds and then dissipates rather quickly. Has a nice hug in the chest

Rating neat 6.5/10

Cut with Water
Nose: mostly the same but more Barley is pulled out for me. More of a honeysuckle than pear this time.

Taste: Wow the Barley really takes over! But it's a sweet Barley not overpowering but definitely letting you know it's Irish.

Finish: this is where it gets good! The brandy comes alive on my tounge and refuses to leave. Sweet and syrupy. If I combine the finish with water with everything else neat I think this would give redbreast a good challenge!

Rating 7/10

Final thoughts:
I think I would like to visit this again once it gets some air into it. I can see where it's trying to go flavor wise the proof is just slightly hindering the sweet notes that dormant because of its proof. But for $30 cheaper than what I paid for redbreast cask, I think this is great. Lots more Barley on the redbreast than on the barrell. This one I think will become a great spring or rainy day sipper for sure!

Thanks for reading!

Profound Bitterness - Is This Common?,"Hey folks, I am a fairly inexperienced whiskey ""drinker"" and overall a very lightweight drinker. In fact, I drink almost exclusively on special occasions (holidays, family gatherings, etc.).

I've noticed that whiskey has an overpowering bitterness to it, no matter the type. So far, I've tried JD #7, Bulleit, and Johnnie Walker. I'd say that Bulleit is by far the worst; the bitterness overpowers every other tasting note in each sip. I've had other types of alcohol (ice wine, sake, beer, etc.), and nowhere do I find the bitterness to be as domineering as it is in whiskey.

Does anyone else have this experience? Is this common amongst inexperienced whiskey drinkers or am I the odd one out?","Sounds like you just don‚Äôt like whiskey. Which is fine, you don‚Äôt have to. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. No need to force yourself to acquire a taste. 

You can get the same social experience with brandy, rum, tequila, wine, craft cocktails, mocktails, etc.
It is likely the effect of the wood on the liquor and your individual interaction with the flavor. I do notice some bitterness in the finish, but for me it is overpowered by the wood sweetness and other flavor profiles I‚Äôd the whiskey. Also, the bitterness is usually pleasant to my taste buds.
I think that's somewhat common. Most people are more bothered by the burn, and whisky is actually quite sweet. But there can be bitterness present as well.
I wonder if you aren‚Äôt tasting so much bitterness as you are astringency. Tannins will create a mouth drying feeling that seems to sap the moisture off your tongue. Do you have the same sensation or taste when you drink red wines? The tannins from the skins and stems in a red wine create astringency like the oak in whiskey does.
Surprised no one said it yet. I can‚Äôt speak for johnnie walker, but bulleit and jack 7 are not good sippers. It‚Äôs mixer whiskey at best. You won‚Äôt need to spend much or search far to find better stuff. There‚Äôs plenty of threads in this subs recommending great bottles under $30, $40, so on. Higher quality whiskey shouldn‚Äôt have that bitterness, and will have a lot more complexity to it where you‚Äôll be able to experience the flavor notes."
Review #1: Edradour 12 Year Natural Cask Strength Ibisco Decanter 2010 Cask 164,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hcyqpjj5rylc1.jpg?width=1752&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0382ab56282d027967de810144eeceeeb589ae8

**ABV: 57.0%, NCF, Natural Color**

**Maturation: 12 years in a Single Oloroso Sherry Cask**

&#x200B;

**Background:** Welcome to my first review! Many people review whisky, but I may have a bit to offer when it comes to reviews for a few reasons: I enjoy a wide range of spirits from heavily peated, non-peated, sherry bombs, ‚Äúdirty whiskies,‚Äù straight bourbons, finished bourbons, Japanese whiskey, world whiskies, etc. I will review a range of different spirits on this page. I am also not an expert by any means.

**Nose:**

Neat: Black cherries and cola. The ethanol doesn‚Äôt hit until the top of my nose, so the thick, dark cherry scent lingers on the front. There is faint tobacco on the nose ‚Äì like the paper that held a cigar.

With water: Far more fruit forward but approachable. You can really dig your nose in the snifter, open your mouth, and take a deep inhale. A mix of black cherries, cola syrup (I swear this is a positive thing) and a note that I remember from a fig balsamic vinegar. I could spend quite a while enjoying the nose.

**Palate:**

Neat: A slight leathery note that serves to balance the cherry and cola. After it coats my entire tongue, I get a beautiful raspberry note. There is a minor astringent note on the mid palate ‚Äì it is my only off-putting note for the scotch as a whole. The texture is viscous. I liken it to Kavalan Solist textures, which is a plus. There is nothing thin about it in taste or mouthfeel.

With water: That astringent note shifts to dark chocolate bitterness, which is a good thing. Fruitier, more expressive, and mouth-watering. All of the other notes remain.

**Finish:**

Neat: Such a long finish. The texture and oiliness ensure that each sip goes a long way. Finally, I get dates ‚Äì the cola dissipates on the finish. The only issue is that the slight bitter, astringent note remains. Don‚Äôt let that scare you away from this scotch though ‚Äì the bitterness does mellow as it sits in the glass.

With water: Blackberry compote? Ok, it sounds like I am just picking dark berries now but the addition of water took away that bitterness and allows the fruits to shine. You lose a bit of the oiliness but the balance that the water brings more than makes up for the difference. Leather remains but it is very pleasant and serves to balance the fruit.

**Thoughts:** While 12 years in a single sherry cask that imparts this much flavor and color may seem one dimensional, I would argue that is much more complex than it seems. As someone who likes extremes, I smile. It is powerful enough to hold up to a bit of water, and the water actually elevates the scotch. Let this bottle breath! The neck pour was a bit harsh, but a month later this bottle really amazed me. It tastes older than its age. Fantastic cask selection from Edradour.

**Why should you get this bottle?:** You like sherried whiskies such as Macallan 12/18, Glendronach, Glenfarclas, Glenlivet 18 etc but are searching for something more extreme and are OK with a bit more of an alcohol note.

**Why shouldn‚Äôt you get this bottle?:** If you are not a fan of sherry bombs, you are setting yourself up for disappointment. It is not a beginner‚Äôs whisky.

&#x200B;

**Overall**: 91. I highly recommend this bottle, and I have another in reserve. Perfect way to start my inaugural review.

^(100: I‚Äôll know it when I taste it‚Ä¶maybe?)

^(90-99: Best in class or damn near perfect. Anything that is a 90+ is an absolute winner for me. If we know each other personally, I have probably mentioned this whisky to you.)

^(80-89: Delicious. I seek out these bottles. There may be an off note or two that prevents it from rising to the 90+, but it is minor.)

^(70-79: Quite good, but would only buy a bottle if it is on sale.)

^(60-69: Will come back to it. Definitely will take a dram if it is available.)

^(50-59: Will only take if free or the only option at a bar, but still palatable.)

^(40-49: No thank you, but I appreciate the craft.)

Review: Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky 18 Year,"So much for dry week.

Currently sitting in a basement filled with ABSURDLY drunk 20+ something year olds. As I was counting down the seconds until I could bolt the hell out of here (I‚Äôm a 37 year old grumpy man serving time as the DD for my wife at her work party while trying to abstain from drinking for a week, oh well), I scanned the bar and had to do a double-take. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Yamazaki 18 year,‚Äù says I to my bored self. Is that for real? Asked the hostess if I could indulge in a pour, and to my delight her head nodded yes. Swell! Time for me to pretend to know what I‚Äôm doing with tasting notes. In my head I‚Äôm as giddy as a wee lad on Christmas morning.

Nose: Floral, honey, a whisp of blueberry (and yes, I exaggerated the ‚Äúwh‚Äù in whisp in true Family Guy fashion.) If this were a blind tasting, I‚Äôd swear this is a Speyside.

Palate: White grape skins, barley is heavy but not overpowering. Very thin. Orange notes make their presence known as I go in for follow up sips.

Finish: Is this sherry-casked finished? Don‚Äôt know for certain but it certainly seems so. I‚Äôm getting very subtle black pepper. I don‚Äôt want this to end.

Value: A+ - didn‚Äôt pay a cent for this, but did surrender some of my Friday evening.

Rating: 8.5 on t8ke scale.


Looks like people are cracking open the Fireball, so things are about to get real dumb. Time to drink some water and egress.

Thanks for reading. Hope you enjoyed.

Cheers!","I paid full price for the bottle and it‚Äôs still a 8.5 to 9 for me.  Cheers!
Bought my last bottle for $350‚Ä¶ it will probably be my last buts it‚Äôs about as close to perfection as it gets for me
Darn, I was in a store in Naples FL last week and they had both Hakushu and Yamazaki, both in 12 and 18 yo expressions, with markups. I brought back the Hakushu 12, but couldn't quite bring myself to pull the trigger on either 18 yo. Maybe next time.
I depend on my early June ( Father‚Äôs Day ) Chicago land drop of this‚Ä¶hate how msrp has climbed from $250 to $449 for it, but, I make it last 9 months so it‚Äôs well worth it
Holy Jealousy, Batman!!
How much for the 18 yo for Yamazaki and Hakushu? Thanks
What do you think of the Hakushu 12?  I rated it like a 4.  It left little to no impression for me.
449 is about half what I've seen it go for.
I‚Äôll buy all they have if it‚Äôs $449.

It‚Äôs going for ¬•250000 in Don Quixote, both Tokyo and Fukuoka. That‚Äôs like almost $1800 per bottle.
I think you're missing a 0 there,  ¬•25000 is like $180
I see the $800+ prices in Chicago as well‚Ä¶my pockets are deep enough to get those‚Ä¶but the 1 MSRP $449 bottle I get a year does the trick for me
My apologies. I‚Äôve added the missing ‚Äú0‚Äù üòÖ"
What‚Äôs Next?,"I‚Äôm relatively new to whiskey, ~6mo. Looking to expand my horizons and maybe help out some fellow newbies. I‚Äôll rate things I‚Äôve tried (and can remember) x/10 and give a quick like/dislike of notes I picked up. If you have any suggestions let me know. Summary is at the bottom for those that don‚Äôt care to read. Thanks!

Straight bourbon:
*BT - 7/10, first bottle, drinkable, eased me in
*ER 10yr (pic) - 8/10, sweet bourbon notes, nice oaky flavor (assuming from age), does taste a bit ‚Äúthin‚Äù to me.
*Calumet 16 (pic) - 9/10, similar comments to ER, but definitely has a deeper taste that I enjoy, maybe a little less smooth (harsher throat) than others, also on the ‚Äúthin‚Äù side like ER, kinda musty if that makes sense.
*Trying Statesman tonight

Wheaters:
*Old Elk (pic) - 10/10, my favorite wheated bourbon, vanilla, honey, caramel, nutty, reminds me of grandma‚Äôs granola. A bit too sweet to just throw back every day.
*Weller SR - 9/10, strong vanilla and caramel, a bit of banana, thinner and more ‚Äúcasual‚Äù than OE. 
*Wilderness Trail - 7/10, good, but a bit muted on flavor and harsh on feel, maybe a bit watery for me?
*Larceny/Green River - 7/10, thicker, darker flavor that I like, definitely not as ‚Äúwatery‚Äù as WT or BT, they just miss the mark a little on the ‚Äúwow this is good‚Äù factor
*1792 - 5/10, I got almost no flavor, tasted like spiced water. Maybe it‚Äôs just me‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt get into it
*Makers French Oak - 8/10, love the vanilla, has a great texture, not too thin like 1792, not too thick like OE, good level of smoke and spice, just gives me heartburn so I don‚Äôt drink it a lot.

Rye:
*Michters US*1 - 10/10, favorite Rye, nice balance of sweet, spicy, woody, even savory. Like a good Texas bbq. Also has that ‚Äúthicker‚Äù taste/feel I prefer.
*Eli Craig (pic) - 8/10, nothing spectacular to note, it‚Äôs just good and comes with a good price tag, flavor is a bit shallow compared to US*1.
*Russel‚Äôs 6 (pic) - 9/10, like a mix of the previous two, falls short of US*1 in flavor complexity and intensity, still a great pour after work.

I‚Äôd really like to focus on the ‚Äúthickness,‚Äù I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on it, maybe someone could help me out. For some reason when a bottle has that kind of body, combined with a good explosion of flavor, I instantly love it. I‚Äôm not picky on straight/wheat/rye/etc. I just like a good complexity, and I don‚Äôt want my whiskey to whisper its notes, I want it to slap me in the face and scream a nice lullaby‚Ä¶ if that makes sense.","Higher proof should have a thicker mouthfeel. I‚Äôd try the old forester rye and knob creek 9. 100 proof. Also willett 4 year rye is usually around 110 and is a complex rye IMO
Thanks for the suggestions. I‚Äôll definitely have to check those out. Didn‚Äôt know that higher proof might be my style. Being new I kinda figured high proof might hurt my underdeveloped taste buds, but I don‚Äôt have any whiskey buddies to help me out so it‚Äôs been brewzle videos and Hail Marys for my entire experience
Yeah it may be a little bit hot at first. Try the bump to 100 first and work your way up if that‚Äôs your desire. I usually stay around 90-100 other than the willett which is just a super unique rye
Went out after a rye yesterday. Didn‚Äôt find Old Forester or Willett, but took your advice on looking for a higher proof. Ended up with Rare Breed Rye (112.2), and it has a lot of what I was looking for. Also surprisingly smooth and approachable, making me feel a bit more comfortable trying some of the higher proof stuff. I guess if it‚Äôs just good, it‚Äôs just good.
Exactly right. If it‚Äôs good it‚Äôs good."
‚ÄúCollection‚Äù (selection) finally complete!,"Mostly because there is simply no more room to store bottles according to my wife‚Ä¶

And yes, these are all meant for consumption not saving! Only thing I have tucked away is a Hibiki Harmony 100th anniversary that I got for $110 and hoping like 25 years from now it will be worth something or make a nice gift for someone.

Thoughts? I can certainly give mine on anything here. Eventually I‚Äôll get around to reviewing a lot of it formally.

There‚Äôs some other stuff in the cabinet too - Redwood Empire Pipe Dream CS (delicious) and their Foggy Burl (interesting but not for me).

As you can see I am a big fan of finished stuff - most of the Irish and Scotches are.

Favorites: Bookers 2023-03, Bardstown Discovey #4, JD SB BS regular whiskey and rye (both amazing, have to say the nose on the whiskey is worth it alone), Michter‚Äôs BS toasted, Blanton‚Äôs SFTB, Nulu wheated, EC BP B523, Stellum rye Fibonacci #1, MWND 11, Glendronach 18, Signet, The single cask: Glen Elgin ruby port finish CS, Infrequent flyers: Deanston 13 Marsala finish, Lady of the glen: Longmorn 12 CS PX finish, Old elk Port cask, Magnus cigar blend, GOTA Hontambere 1985 Armagnac, Gold spot, Redbreast CS, both Dair Ghaelachs, Irishman 17, Dunville‚Äôs 11yr CS PX, Celtic cask 49.

All worth their going price or a bit more for sure.

Disappointed: Elijah Craig 18 (biggest regret here even for $179 - could just be a dud SB), 2XO Gem of KY & Bombergers declaration 2023 (both good but not worth the price), Hillrocks (great but there‚Äôs a charred bitterness that keeps throwing me off), Weller 12 (not worth more than $100 - remember older bottles tasting better), Blanton‚Äôs (again, when it was $50 everywhere sure, but it just doesn‚Äôt do it for me anymore over $100), Springbank 18 2016 (same - good and unique but $249 is too much), Edradour 11 CS Sauternes matured (good just had higher expectations- maybe needs to sit longer), Redbreast Tawny Port and 2023 bottling of PX, Dingle Grianstad Gheimhridh.","One hell of a selection there my friend! May I ask how the Whistlepig 12 was for you? Haven't opened mine, got it as a gift from my parents when they visited Japan early last year, waiting for my birthday this year to crack it, stoked. Looks like you've got a ton of great bottles to work through, cheers! :)
How are the found norths?
Nice selection! How are the Seelbach's and the Celtic Cask? I see you snuck that Hontambere in too lol.
For a second I thought I posted something without realizing it. We have pretty similar [collections](https://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/s/FKqJPuDz7o) and shelving
How is that Penelope American Light Whiskey?
I was considering EC 18 for $165. I haven‚Äôt heard that it‚Äôs worth the price tag and this is the nail in the coffin. I‚Äôll stick to the ECBPs.
What did you think of seelbachs 9?
How would you rank
Signet, Grendronach 18 and Royal Salute?
It‚Äôs great. Questionable if I‚Äôd buy another for the $150 I see it for but it‚Äôs very well balanced. Not too heavy of a finish, the spirit shines through well.
Their most recent numbered release, 008, is absolutely fantastic
They are quite tasty - definitely a great value. Would love to try them all, especially the other SB finishes, just so hard to find most places! I would say if you see any in the wild just buy it and you will not have regrets. Some great Canadian stock out there, glad they are acquiring and blending it well.
That seelbachs is excellent - some great barrels they pick! Tastes like it costs more. $99 was definitely fair. 

Had a few Celtic casks in Ireland too - amazing stuff. Wish I could have them all! This one is a nice sherry bomb - can‚Äôt beat the 22yr age for the price! I order from Celtic whiskey shop often and it‚Äôs worth the shipping/duty.
Haha I see that! Glad someone mentioned your shelf issue - first thing I noticed was that peg with no weight on it! If they don‚Äôt have a center support may not hurt to add something? I feel confident about mine - but please weigh in! They‚Äôre solid original built-ins so 30 lbs shouldn‚Äôt be a problem I‚Äôm figuring.

How do you like the red spot vs the others? I know I liked it when I was visiting Ireland frequently, but I drank a lot of whiskey and Guinness üòÖ so who knows what I remember. I keep seeing people thinking it‚Äôs too thin and light. I‚Äôm always tempted to add one at like $120 to one of my Ireland orders‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs certainly different. Good though - randomly found it for $110. Figured I wouldn‚Äôt see it again and it‚Äôs 15 years. It‚Äôs definitely hot - but it has a bright caramelized banana flavor mixed with some nail varnish lol. Ice doesn‚Äôt smooth it out that much. It‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt mind spending $$ just to try something. Better options out there - not that I‚Äôve tried much light whiskey. The Barrell Pineau des charentes finished SB CS is a light whiskey too - much better IMO.
Knowing you can get 2 for that price it‚Äôs a no brainer! Maybe if you could sample the exact barrel and decide first‚Ä¶I know I liked it in the past - the 23 year is much better but def priced out of reasonability.
Love it - if I didn‚Äôt feel so saturated with bourbons and love scotch and Irish so much I‚Äôd def stock up on more of their private label stuff. It‚Äôs exactly like you‚Äôd want a well aged CS KY bourbon to taste like. Their description on Seelbachs is very accurate.
Signet in the lead for sure - then Glendronach 18. Royal salute is smooth balanced and delicious but it lacks that wow factor. I think it really needs to be like 43% to let some of the flavor punch through. But the GD18 kicks hard - if you‚Äôre into easy drinking scotch, the RS may be better for you. Even if it‚Äôs not my favorite style or bottle that I have - I can appreciate the Signet as probably the best thing out there under $300 - truly exquisite.
A very reassuring and exciting answer, thanks!
I‚Äôm a huge fan of red spot. However, blue is a true juggernaut and I‚Äôm also a huge fan of gold. I probably rank them blue>gold>red but that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not happy paying a pretty penny for red spot 

That said, the recent price increases of the spots has been ridiculous. I paid $99 for my blue spot and now the store wants $299. Just msrp tripling

But‚Ä¶. Let me know where you can find one for $120‚Ä¶. Red spot is $250 at *costco* now
That sounds a lot like what I get from the JD SBBP. Appreciate the insight!
Nice. Thanks you. Signet is on my top list.
Irishmalts.com is great. $120 there RN. If you‚Äôre getting a few bottles the shipping balances out. Worth it for some hard to find Irish stock. You prefer it over the yellow? I do love that one too. Lucky I got my blue locally for $115 before things went nuts.
I see the similarity! Def prefer the JD though.
Woa honestly there a screaming deal. Even one bottle comes to like $170 all in. I‚Äôd pay that in a heartbeat. Might get a backup bottle just in case 

Cheers
Yes I prefer red to yellow. All are fantastic but aside from blue, red, and gold I‚Äôll usually just get redbreast 12CS
I actually just ordered the red spot and a bushmills causeway 2010 cognac cask from them! Thanks for pushing me over the edge ü•≤ I‚Äôm gonna have to clear off another shelf of my wife‚Äôs stuff lol
Tbf, you have a shit ton of room

Look at my shelf. That stuff is packed three or four deep. 

But‚Ä¶. I also know wives don‚Äôt see things quite the way we do haha"
A genuine question.,"A long time ago I found out that I really love to drink hard liqour, mainly whisky/whiskey with all the different interesting notes of flavours and what I liked the most was wood taste (from the barrells I guess, but i'm not an expert) :D I have worked in places that had bars and for example the same whiskey like Jack Daniels just feels completely different from there to what I would get in the exact same bottle from the shop/market. I'm not talking just Jack Daniels though.. Have compared a few and it has all been a disappointment from the shops/markets where whisky/whiskey just feels like it's straight up alcohol without any  ""special"" taste. Haven't compared Tenjaku whisky with the shop one yet, but very much want to do so. Also maybe I have written in the wrong reddit since I know whisky and whiskey are different, but my point still stands. Is it just my country being like that? Are shops buying something that's not really what it is? Obviously bars are more expensive.. I want to add that it's not because I have tried it in a bar with people around me to not feel lonely, I was basically alone ;O I have heard same stories about wine in our country that if you want to get something really nice you have to deliver it yourself from the production land or something.. The country is Latvia btw. I hope what I write makes sense. I tend to drink hard alcohol not to get wasted, but for the taste.. Could anyone enlighten me about this? Should I try to find out where bars order from and try to do the same? Can't order 100 bottles tho.. I really don't think it's placebo since I can just feel the alcohol not tasting the same. Regarding bar Jack Daniels I have had a bottle of the same thing at home and got some from the bar and the difference was 100% noticeable even if I had my eyes closed. Maybe I should add that I can feel difference the bettween tap water/filtered wated/mineral water/boiled water. Literally did a test with my friends with eyes closed and guessed everything correctly. What's going on? Any advice is welcomed. Sorry for bad englando it's not my first language.

Edit : The Tenjaku I have tried at a bar had almost no alcohol taste and just pleasant notes of what i can't figure out. And the light drunk feeling was out of this world.","I can't really answer your questions friend. Depending on my mood, vibe or what I ate before, whisky might taste different to me, even if ever so slightly. What's more, many factors change how your whiskey tastes, including¬†glassware, temperature and the environment. I don't go do bars myself tho. Anyway, this sub is dedicated to all types of whisk(e)y, fell free to post your questions. And yes, woody notes come from barrel/cask. Greetings from Poland ;). Cheers!
whisky interacts with oxygen over time, most bottles in a bar have been open for a while so they tend to have already gone through that. of course it depends on other factors but generally the longer a bottle has been open the softer the alcohol taste will be. next time you have a whisky at home let it sit in the glass for 10-15 minutes before drinking it and see if that makes a difference
Thanks for the answer! I would really like to know the scientific answer as to why it could taste different in different glassware, but the temperature makes sense to me. I guess I should google it. I did try different things in different glasswares and even in a paper cup like the ones used for the coffee.. So I really suspect that the alcohol that shops/markets are buying and selling are some kind of a ripoff.. Maybe that's why it kind of justifies the price difference compared to buying alcohol at the bar. Although I have looked at the invoices from the buy-ins at the bar and they do buy the same alcohol brands from warehouses with lower tax thus having lower prices per bottle than shops since it's a company. All this makes me wonder if shops/markets are buying it at an even cheaper price (it's a company too) and even lower quality or maybe the brands that they are selling are not even the real thing.. Could be some conspiracy going on there or it's just in my head and I think that if you pay more you get better quality. I don't believe that though because I had made tests with identical beverages from a bar and a shop. It just doesn't compare and you can feel only the alcohol taste in the shop bought beverages while in the bar there are other notes and flavours.. I'm either schizo or up to something :D
Ohh that's something I have never thought about! I will try your suggestion. Thank you very much!"
Tasted the new 2023 special release from diageo(spirited Xchange),Very informative and interesting tasting all of the whiskey is cask strength and every single bottle had  something wonderful to bring to the table in its own way (I can give notes and a bit of information if anybody is interested),"i‚Äôm curious what you thought of the bunch. they tend to sit around at my local store due to the inflated price, but i picked up a bottle of the clynelish and thought it was decent. not worth the price i paid, but still a cool bottle to have on the shelf i guess
Screw Diagio and these releases.
Those are some sick labels.  üòç
They all were good in their own regard 
The clynelish bottle was the smoothest one 
But if I had to pick one I would choose the lagavulin I really enjoyed what they did with the Don Julio tequila barrels.
If you like them a little bit more smokey with a hint of saltiness the talisker is a definite winner.
Take the oban if you enjoy a bit of sweetness to your whiskey the rum cask did an amazing job.
I agree with you that prices are insane
Yeah, they are beautiful."
Blind Results from Last Night... ,"A few notes from some blind tastings... 

John J Bowman unanimously beat Blanton's and EHT SmB. Fuller flavor profile and the extra, time in the barrel made a significant difference. 

Stagg 22A beat 23B and 23C unanimously. 

ECBP - C922>A124>B523. King Ranch single barrel (10yr 131 proof) was about equal with C922. 

At MSRP, Weller Antique 107 is one of the best bottles you can buy. 

EHT BP slightly beat out Stagg 22A, results were mixed. 

Michters Barrel Proof toasted finish is one of the best toasted barrel finishes I've tried. Far better than EC Toasted Barrel and JD 2023 Heritage Twice Barrelled. 

Russell's Reserve 13 (LL/KE) was the big winner for the night. Most people had the RR13 over the EHT BP. Proof difference between the two was not as noticeable as one would have imagined. I think the RR13 drinks, slightly above it's proof point. 

Cheers. 

","More like holy shit I'm blind from last night amirite¬†
You're dead, right? That's a shit ton to blind
Fuck you.  I mean that in a good way.
JJB is the best. Love that stuff.
Interesting results! Love the RR13, not surprising that was king!

How much did you try for each bottle and what did you do between pours to clear your palate? You must have a palate of steel! After about 4-5 even 1 oz pours my palate is blown.
Thoughts on the Knob Creek 12?
OWA 107 single barrel‚Äôs are the most underrated bottle IMO. I‚Äôd rather have 5 of those than a Pappy 15.
Which John J Bowman was it? Couldn‚Äôt find it in the pic! üëÄ
Considering most of these aren‚Äôt open, this is an attempted flex, no?
Ohhhhh, you got MONEY money
It was a high proof kind of afternoon.
My first time trying the 10yr single barrel, got lucky on a bottle last week. Lives up to the hype around it.
I doubt they were even 1oz pours honestly. This was over a good 5hr period or so. Just did water and salteens between tastings and it seemed to clear out it pretty well. It's tough to get all the guys together these days, so when we can, it's go big or go home.
If available for MSRP, buy it. Always try to keep one laying around. Will have to run it against, some other 100 proofers soon, I'd imagine it will do very well blind though.
Single barrel, behind the antique 107 but in front of the EHT SmB
This was before we started tasting, only thing not opened is the van winkle 12. Buddy wouldn't open that one now. Everything else, atleast 1 is open. There are some unopened backups though.
If this is like 4-5 people's stuff, most of which was bought at MSRP over a few years, then it's not really a ton of money. Mostly just hard to accumulate all of it without drinking it.


I have most of the bottles in this picture (not duplicates or anything) and a few they don't have, and it wasn't THAT expensive.
Does your single barrel have the front green label too or have they changed it?
Haha I love it. 5 hours is great, and this makes a lot more sense over that time period. Jealous you got to taste so many stellar bottles!
Yeah this is mine and one other friends collection, all at MSRP. We live in a control state. This is over a few years, but still not everything in the collection. Just the ones, we pulled out for a Pic.
Green label
Yeah that's one of the very few benefits of living in a control state. I'm in Pennsylvania and can get everything here at MSRP as well. Expensive, for sure, but not out of control. Biggest issue is just finding it at all. If you enter enough lotteries or just wait for the weekly drops, you'll eventually be able to amass a nice little collection like this.

Hope you enjoyed the tasting! Lots of good stuff here.
Alot of these bottles included standing outside in the cold all night to be one of the first in line. Van winkle 12 was a lottery win... I mostly drink WT101 and EW BiB on the regular though."
I tasted 19 y.o. Edradour Ballechin today!,"OMG!

Exceptional taste! Manzanilla sherry casks really added incredible taste to it! A bit dry, but sweet and with tiny note of burnt wood and peat, cask strength (55% alc) feels like you are drinking liquid iron. Literally gave me chills!

Highly recommended, if you spot it somewhere! By far in top-5 whiskeys I ever tried!

Top 3 note preferences would be vanilla, caramel, banana. Over the year I haven‚Äôt changed my preference much just become more open to new things. Still not a Rye or Scotch guy though.

Edit: I‚Äôll also say, I‚Äôve figured out I prefer a 4-8 year bottle over the stuff over 10. I also like my proof between 90-110.
I like it a lot. Not an everyday pour, but it brings enough sweetness and unique flavor that I think about it often. Wasn‚Äôt disappointed paying the $100.00 mark for it.
Russels Reserve single barrel is calling your name.

I was going to say Jack Daniels barrel proof but might be too high ABV. But you can always add a bit of water
I‚Äôll check them out!"
Had a nice bit of Irish tonight,"Had a tasting of my Redbreasts
Each of the is truly a delicious pour, and unique in their own way. 
I owned the 15, and was gifted the 27 as a very special thank-you.  (Very special!)  So I felt I had to buy the 21 to balance my collection ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It was a lean-in but well worth it. The way I drink, all three will last me a few years, so I don‚Äôt mind. 
I am not for being able to wax eloquently about all the subtle flavors but I will give a high-level review:
15 year is truly a delicious pour. So much full flavor. If this was all I had of the three, I would  be happy. A delicious and solid pour I will keep on the shelf and replenish as needed. And it is at a reasonable price point. 

21 year was a little softer (ok a lot) on the front end but had the more sophisticated long finish that the extra 6 years brings. If I was drinking with some buddies, maybe I would prefer the 15. Relaxing with my wife on a quiet evening, the 21 is just an amazing chill pour that lingers and captivates. Delicious and complex. 

27 year is an interesting story. Highly finished whiskies are sometimes a bit much for me, whether it is port or sherry or cognac. And at first sip I don‚Äôt love the 27 as much as I should. BUT on the second sip, and after savoring it, this is an amazing pour. Much different from the 15 or 21. Very sophisticated. Very complex and deep. And very nice. Certainly not an every day sipper, but truly a special pour to enjoy at the end of an evening, perhaps with some very nice cheese (which I sadly did not have this time but did when I cracked it with the person who gave it to me). A special bottle and special gift I will cherish in special moments for several years to come. 

Thanks for hearing me out.  Hope this doesn‚Äôt come across as a flex. I feel fortunate to be able to have these. Cheers ü•É","Thank you for sharing your notes! I finished a 21 last year and absolutely loved it. The 27 is on my list, hopefully o can sample at a bar in the mean time. Cheers"
One word: Orgasmic ,"I love it being aged in sherry, it‚Äôs reminiscent of Yamazaki 18. I get heavy sweat notes, vanilla, cherry, some citrus, some dark chocolate
I do enjoy that‚Äôs there‚Äôs a slight burn, not as smooth as the NAS Harmony in my opinion. 

I can taste it all, Mizunara from Yamazaki, slight peat, apple/citrus notes from Hakushu & little bit of the grain from Chita

Next is to purchase or purchase a dram of the 30yr","I‚Äôm sorry, heavy *sweat* notes??
I‚Äôm a major Hibiki fan‚Ä¶I‚Äôve yet to have this. Lucky bastard

Who's *sweat* are we talking about?
Sweet** my fault
If ur coming from non Japanese whiskey, yamazaki will be a better gateway

How do you guys drink whiskey? ,"Hello! 

I'm quite new to the whiskey of it all, but I wish to learn, so I thought where else to ask but here. 

I'm geniuenly looking for some step-by-step or a bit of a guide-ish to look at, or just read and internalize, so I can actually start enjoying whiskey as it is, not just mixing it with coke :D

Like any way to introduce it to the pallete first? How do you go about feeling the flavors and actually tasting the notes? Any ways to not get shocked by the high ethanol content? Just any tips you guys have acquired during your hobby? 

I searched around and there's been some okay answers, but mostly vague, but I'm genuinely looking for like a nice ""proper"" way to go about it, to get the most out of a whiskey and just learn how to enjoy it. 

Thanks in advance for any answers. ","If you watch the movie ‚Äòneat‚Äô Freddie from Buffalo Trace actually gives a tasting lesson and how to get to neat. I do neat, rocks, highball‚Ä¶.
Start with a small sip to acclimate the palate.  The initial alcohol burn will kill off most flavors.  From there, you can taste finer notes.

Some like to put a single ice cube in there or a small drop of water.

The key is that first sip to get your taste buds opened up.  Shooting alcohol will never give you the taste notes that differentiate one whiskey from another.

Good luck!
Start with a lower proof bourbon on some rocks and then try with a splash of water or neat. 

Drink whiskey often and try a lot of different whiskeys, a lot of different ways and see what you like. Whiskey sours, old fashioned‚Äôs, manhattans, other cocktails, are all good ways to enjoy different whiskeys as well. No wrong way to do it really. 

Drink what you like, how you like it.
I prefer it over ice, most of the time. Just a nicer beverage to me that way.
The way I teach people at work is; start off with it neat, you can go from there later.


Bring the glass up to your nose, breathe in deep and enjoy the aromas


When your lungs are full enough, hold your breath and sip on it, let it roll around your taste buds while you maybe count to 2 or 3


Swallow and exhale (mouth or nose, depending who you ask, but it's up to you with what works better)


Usually, that'll give you a good idea if it suits your tastes and you can add water/rocks/coke as needed


When we hold our breath we aren't inhaling the alcohol fumes, which is usually what makes us sputter and cough and want to down it quickly and chase it away

Hope it helps!!


Edit: Invest in some good glasses, Glencairn snifters make a huge difference in the experience but just about any rocks glass will work, just not as effectively
I slightly open my mouth to take a sip and I swallow the liquid after tasting it. 

All jokes aside: Neat with perhaps a bit of water to open it up.
There are lots of ways to go about getting into whiskey. Here is my take:

I would start with whiskey and mixer drinks, slowly increasing the amount of whiskey and keeping the mixer the same (or decrease). So maybe 1oz of a mixing whiskey (really, you could use any whiskey under $25) to 6oz ginger ale/soda/Coke to start.

Then try Old Fashioneds. This really highlights the whiskey, but makes it easier to drink because of more sugar and added dilution.

Next, try to drink whiskey on a large ice cube. This will open up the flavors over time and dilute/chill the drink.

Next is the best part. You have acclimated to drinking whiskey and may want to experiment drinking whiskey neat (no ice, water, nothing. Just whiskey in a glass). The best way to do this, IMO, is to go to a bar that has a great whiskey selection. Do your research and find a place that does whiskey flights. Then you can try multiple whiskeys at once, while not committing to purchasing a full bottle or multiple 2oz pours. Make sure to take notes on which ones tasted best to you.

Once you determine the whiskeys you like best, I would Google ""whiskey similar to (insert the whiskey you liked best here)"". 

Now that you have tasted whiskey in multiple forms and formed your own opinion on whiskeys, you can go off into the world of whiskey to explore all the possibilities!
Start with the old fashioned, then go to ice and water, and finally if you like start moving to neat. But there‚Äôs no ‚Äúright‚Äù way to drink it. Elmer T Lee himself used to drink it with ginger ale (which is actually quite good)
With gusto.
I like to boof it with a dropper
I started on old fashioneds. It's a nice way to ease yourself into the taste of bourbon
If you're wanting to ""appreciate"" whiskey, as Charles MacLean puts it, meaning you want to delve deep into it for analysis and such, I suggest **comparison tasting**.

Let's say you want to delve deep into straight bourbon, to have an advanced palate and get all these notes everyone talks about. Get a bottle of a baseline, entry-level bourbon (such as Wild Turkey original, Old Forester original, Evan Williams Black, Jim Beam original, or even Old Crow). Then, get a bottle of one that's a step-up (such as Wild Turkey 101, Old Forester Signature 100, Evan Williams White BIB, etc). Pour a dram of each into a glass (a glencairn IMO is ideal but any tulip-shaped one should work fine).

If you want to put a small amount of water in each, that's fine too. I suggest a couple drops to, at most, 1 ml. Water can ""open up"" the whiskies and bring out fuller aromas and flavors. But if you want to keep it simple for now and not do the water, perfectly fine.

Now, smell the entry-level one. Don't sip! Get the aromas first. Bring your nose just close enough to it but not so close you get the alcohol burn. It's ok to back your nose away a bit. Then, smell the other bourbon, same way. Compare the notes and aromas.

Of course you can write all this down if you want.

Take a sip of the entry-level one, a small sip as if you're sipping hot coffee, and let it rest on your tongue for a few seconds. Swish it around if you want. Then, of course, swallow. Think about what you just sipped. Next, take a sip of the other one and do the same exact way. Compare the flavors you just had. And that's basically all there is to it.

Since you're new, instead of two bourbons, you can compare one entry-level bourbon against, say, an entry-level single-malt scotch (Glenlivet 12, Glenmorangie 10, Glenfiddich 12, or another single malt that's 10 or 12 years old). 

You can compare three at a time if you want: entry-level bourbon vs. entry-level single malt scotch vs. entry-level straight rye. And so on.

But whatever you do, go slow and take your time. You will get inebriated so whatever you do, make sure you don't have to drive anywhere afterwards.

I don't watch Whiskey Tribe anymore really but this video is great for beginners, it helped me quite a bit: https://youtu.be/LqrVZA3Ccxk?si=VHvdCZNveCOUJ63r
Mouth. Had to cut back due to health problems. Sad.
I drink about 2-3 oz at a time from a tumbler with a single large cube of ice. Let it melt and cool for like 60-90 seconds then enjoy.
My coworker laughed at me because I used my Elijah Craig Toasted barrel for a pickle back shot. To each their own üòÇ
Neat and only neat. I've tried cocktails and they just aren't my thing. I've tried with ice and absolutely hate it. 

If I'm drinking whiskey, I want the full flavor as it was intended from the bottle. I just love the taste of straight whiskey, especially bourbon.
Start with lower proof. Try 2 different ones at the same time to have something to compare to.
Almost always neat. Otherwise on the rocks.
Get to know a good bartender who likes whiskey and hopefully has a signature cocktail.
With my mouth.
I started work old fashioneds, then started to use just one ice cube that I would stir 20 times, and then remove the ice so it does not continue to dilute. Over time I would stir it less and less until I stopped using ice altogether.¬†
I'm the bourbon and coke drinking antichrist.
I started a few years ago but have since acquired hundreds of bottles. I was in the same position as you were and discovered a few things to enhance my flavor discovery process. 

1. Get a nosing glass. A Glencairn a good one.  

2. Pour your whisky and set it a distance from you. Start trying to make out the flavors as you bring the glass closer and closer to your nose and move the glass further away to see if you can detect nuances. I'd argue smell is often more important than tasting in the mouth. 

3. Before taking a sip bring the glass right up to your nose but breathe through your mouth. You'll get sweetness and flavors on the top of your tongue and roof of your mouth. 

4. Sip the whisky and swish it around your mouth. Coat your gums and leave it in your mouth until the alcohol burn wears off. Higher ABVs are generally more oily and complex. You'll start appreciating the different between palette flavors and finishes more this way. 

As you get better with picking out flavors, you can start introducing water as water bring outs more flavors and nuances that were overpowered. 

Once you find the perfect amount of water or just drinking neat you can start playing with temperature. Cold whisky tastes very different from hot whisky. I have a larger glass filled with boiling water that I dip the glencairn in. This is how some sommelier judge and rate whiskys. 

Lastly take your time and enjoy!
Most ppl will probably say a variation of ‚Äúthe best way to drink whiskey is how you like it.‚Äù And they‚Äôre not wrong but I think you‚Äôre wanting to intentionally expand your interests. 

The recommendation another commenter made is actually good. I‚Äôd add some things to it. I think a key is finding a whiskey you like. A lot of newbies want smoother stuff, so if that‚Äôs the case you want to aim for something low proof and on the sweeter side. Jack Daniels is actually really good in this respect. So is crown. I find wheated bourbons are also fairly smooth. 

So I would apply the other recommendation of cocktail>ice>water>neat. But do it with something mild. Then when you‚Äôre to the point where you can drink jack neat, start expanding your horizons into some common stuff that good. I know it‚Äôs every frat‚Äôs ambrosia, but wild turkey 101 is actually a great quality whiskey for the price and it brings a higher proof you can work on adapting too. 

Like all things, it takes practice.
Definitely start with small sips, add some ice if the ethanol burns too much. It takes some time to get used to the ethanol. I would recommend starting with an Irish whiskey like Jameson, as they tend to be low proof and overall not very harsh on the palate. Starting with a low proof bourbon would be good too, such as Buffalo Trace, Old Forester 86, Makers Mark, etc. I would not go over 100 proof while starting out. If you buy two bottles of whiskey or more, doing a side by side comparison on smell and flavor will help you start to pick out the nuances in the spirit. Having a glencairn glass will help significantly with smelling.
A lot of it. in a glass.  like meemaw
Keep it at 100 proof or lower to start as well as keeping the price tag under $49 to start. Drink it however you want, it‚Äôs meant to be enjoyed.
Start with lower proofs 80 to  90. I suggest you first try them neat. Make the first couple of sips small like you are drinking something hot. Let them sit on and cover your tongue to get acclimated. When you swallow, breath out through your mouth. You can then experiment by adding a drop or two of water and then try ice, a large cube, or only one small one to prevent over dilution. 

Don't be swayed by price. I have some good 30.00 to 50.00 dollar whiskeys and some 100.00 plus bottles that aren't really that much better. 

Cocktails, my favorites are Old Fashioned, Boulevarder, Manhattan, and even a Whiskey Sour.

Good luck, and enjoy your journey. It is never ending.
I try it straight, then either put a bit of water in or an ice cube. If it‚Äôs a new whiskey I always try it this way twice before deciding if I hate it. If I hate it, I mix it with a cola.
Started off drinking 80 proof scotches and 90 prooof bourbons strait. Really it‚Äôs just conditioning yourself to the ethanol burn and the flavors will come.
Sometimes neat, sometimes on the rocks and sometimes with diet coke.
Ralfy.com or look up ralfy on you tube he will teach you how to pull out all the flavors of a whiskey
Any way I can get it. Mixed, rocks, neat, shooters, straight from the bottle. Drink em if ya got em.
Neat with a few drops of water
Typically out of a glass.  If I drink out of the bottle my wife always has comments towards me.
Neat. Sometimes I make an old fashioned or a high ball, but mostly neat.
I started with mixed drinks just Jim beam and ginger ale being my go to. Eventually worked towards liking the flavor enough to drink with just a splash of ginger ale. Then whiskey on the rocks, then eventually enjoyed it neat
Neat. However I came into Scotch first and then migrated to bourbon, rye and Irish. Now I do anything from 80ish proof up to almost hazmat. Just take the time and enjoy.
Most of mine is neat I will have a glass or bottle of water close by those
Best advice anyone can give- experiment. See how you like it. When you try something new (or first sip of anything), smell it. Take in the aromas and see what you can smell. Write it down. Then take a sip, either swirl it around with get your palate acclimated then (or) take a sip and see what you taste. Write it all down. Then look at tasting notes. This will help you train yourself to find the notes in whiskey. After that, try it neat, try with a couple drops of distilled water or a globe. See how you like it. I have friends who only put whiskey on a globe if it's over 115 proof. You'll also find, you like some whiskeys mixed with something or in a cocktail. The key takeaway is, whiskey is fun and relaxing, and there really aren't any rules on how to drink it.
Neat
Scotch and good bourbon I drink neat. Anything that‚Äôs just alright I either make an olde fashioned or just mix with ginger ale.
I drink it with my mouthhole.
Pour it in my mouth hole and suck it down my throat
A leather glove.
When I first started I drunk whiskey sours. Then I put a little water in it and eventually I started drinking it neat.  
But the key is small sips and really look for what the notes are in the whiskey and what it has to offer, Then after a little practice you‚Äôll start to pick stuff out of it. Good luck
Very carefully
90% of the time, neat. The rest of the time a Highball, Whiskey Soda (7-up), Old Fashioned or a Manhattan- in that order of most to least.
I saw somewhere when nosing to periodically smell your own skin or clothing something familiar to help reset everything. Unfortunately for me I don‚Äôt get nearly everything that these reviewers get but I know the difference between good and ok. Hopefully you have a more sophisticated pallete than me.
With my mouth, wow!
I'd say start with breathing it in to acclimate the palate. Then small sip once the sting from breathing it in seems to dissipate. I wouldn't expect more than five big sniffs, probably less. If you don't notice any difference by five, just go take a small sip.

This is more effective the stronger the whiskey, but still helps even down in the 80s.

It helps filter out the burn and pick out other things.

Well, at least in my opinion. I don't have much beyond personal experience to back it up and I might just be weird.
Have you tried the NEAT glass yet? It really does help diffuse the alcohol vapors that a neat glass will funnel into your nose..
I agree with this. I dont know if it's just me but the glass changes the taste. Also, i will swish in around my mouth. Lick my lips. I'm a woman that's always preferred neat.
Rye and Ginger Ale is great as well!
I just jumped right into it and went neatü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Lol
Copy that
I am unfamiliar and my quick Google search didn't seem to turn anything up that stood out, tell me about them?
How different is it from a glencairn, if you have happened to compare the two
I thought those were for Japanese whiskey. I‚Äôll have to give them a shot I guess really what‚Äôs the difference
I'm not articulate enough to explain why but is most certainly does! I try not to encourage swishing without the preface of ""gently"". I've had some people take it to heart and act like the whiskey is mouth wash.
Went to a dinner business meeting with a group of southern gentlemen a few years back, and was introduced to Crown and Ginger. A delicious combination that translates well to other whiskies.
Braver than me.
Take a Glencarin glass and squish it down some, and flare out the top edge some. Like with the Glencarin, the bowl allows aromas collect, and the flare at the top allows the ethonal vapors out, while one puts their nose in the middle of the glass and receives the aromas. Yeah, there is a bit of a learning curve to it, but it really does make for a good dram.  A couple buddies have a whiskey podcast (the Whiskey Tangent) and on one of their early episodes, explored using several different glasses. The NEAT glass won.
It's wider with a bigger bowl, and a flared top. The flare allows the alcohol vapors escape, and the aromas come up. I like the Glencarin glass, it's good, but neat took what Glencarin did, and raised it. I only found out about the NEAT glass thanks to a couple of buddies with a whiskey podcast (the whiskey tangent), they had an early episode where they compared several glasses including glencarin, neat and rocks glass along woth another one or two.
Hmm. I know Glencarin was specifically made for scotch. The NEAT glass was made for whiskey in general. They have a couple of different versions, and the one with the stem is the one to get. You can find those on their website along with stemless. You can also find stemless on Amazon. If it wasn't for a couple of buddies, I never would have known about the glasses. They really do help bring more out. Granted, they aren't really the glass to put a globe in.
Lol. I started like an amateur though. I drink it like a shot. I‚Äôm cultured now haha. I only gulp down what I don‚Äôt like now
I'm gonna have to pick up a couple, thank you!!
I recommend their glass with the stem. For that you need to go to their website. If you get stemless, you can also go to Amazon."
Stagg options,I‚Äôve got a choice between Stagg 125.9 proof 23C and Stagg 127.8 proof.  Does anyone know the tasting notes for these?  What would you pick and why?,"Everything I‚Äôve read/heard indicates that 23c is more well received but both are good üëçüèª
127.8 proof looks to be 23B. I'd recommend searching r/bourbon or your most trusted YouTube reviewer for the best information as each persons palate may be different. I'm sure there are comparisons 23B vs 23C.

https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/search?q=stagg+23b+vs+23c&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=stagg+23b+vs+23c
There were three batches for Stagg in 23?  I thought they only release two per year.
I have both opened among a few other batches, they're all really good. If you don't have any, go for the higher proof, Stagg never disappoints and more bang for your buck never hurts.
I picked up 23C last night! Came home and compared it to my 23B and I would definitely grab B. IMO, I feel like 23B is a Jr to GTS 2023 with very close flavor profiles. GTS 2023 was Magnificent!!! Hands down my favorite pour so far."
Whiskey Birthday Gift,"looking to buy a friend a whiskey to celebrate his 30th, I know he likes his Irish whiskey being a Jameson drinker, I don't know to much about whiskey and what would be considered good but I heard redbreast is quality, which one would you recommend or would you know any other options in the ¬£80-200 pound range.

I've known the guy for most of my life and we're headed to NY with a couple of others from the area to celebrate so I'd like it to be something top quality, thanks.

https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/234134/redbreast-19-year-old

It is fairly expensive, but not much above what the more commonly seen Redbreast 21 year old is priced at, both in the UK and in the USA. The 21 year old is bottled at a more moderate proof (46% ABV)

This 19 year old version which you linked to is bottled at a higher proof (58.9% ABV), and is an exclusive bottling for that UK-based whisky store.

A higher proof is generally a very good thing for an experienced whisky drinker who likes to drink cask strength scotches & Irish whiskies, or barrel proof bourbons. But it might be a little bit on the hot side (that is, have a strong alcohol flavor) for a more casual drinker who is not into whiskies all that much. This can however be helped by adding a little bit of water to the glass when drinking it.

The higher ABV% of the 19 yo you've linked to would be my main concern regarding purchasing this for somebody who is a Jameson drinker - it is hard to know how to parse that description - some Jameson drinkers are casual whiskey drinkers and might not be into a higher proof bottle, others may be more experienced and would really enjoy something higher proof. It is hard to tell here which group your friend falls into.

So, without more info re: the drinking preferences of your friend, I'm flipping coins regarding whether this 19 yo or the regular Redbreast 21 would be a better choice for about the same amount of money.

Hope that helps, good luck with your trip and Happy Birthday to your friend.
Tullamore Dew 18 Year

You're welcome.
Appreciate the response, Jameson is just what I know he drinks day to day but hes into a lot of different ones from different places like Japan. good lookin on that website as I was looking for reviews on the 19 but couldn't find any proper ones. 

I'll probably stick with the 19 to see but thanks again for the response.
Appreciate you, will have a look into this
i hope this is significantly better than the 14 because i was not impressed
It's all personal taste, regardless. Someone might take a sip of Jack Daniels #7 and think ""This is the best!"", then spit out a sip of Midwinter Night Dram."
"Are ""C Batches"" Better? Any Why?","I would like to understand this whole ""C Batch"" thing. The various subs and blogs are full of reviews and it seems that no matter the distillery/expression, it feels like the ""C"" batch of any given year (e.g. C923) is the most highly rated and sought after. Am I off the mark on this, or is that a legit observation? And if so, why?

It seems like it should make no difference if it's the 1rst, 2nd, 3rd batch of the year. It's the same cycle and process: taste, pull, and mix barrels that have been aging for 6+ years, so why should the third time you do that in a year be any better than the first time?","The C batch thing is very recent, and mainly because ECBP C923 blew people away and C922 was also very good. But that hasn't always been true. A121 and A120 we're both the best of their years IIRC.

A124 has a chance to be the best of this year. Despite the age & proof, it's very good.
If this trend continues, my collection will look like my report card in high school. All C‚Äôs.
Heaven hill labels batches like that, and Stagg just started doing it. Who else even uses ""C"" in a batch name?
Save the Best for last
C923 has an older age statement than most ECBP releases.  It had much older barrels mixed into this release and a very high proof which in combination makes it a very good pour and at $80 it‚Äôs a very good value too.  I don‚Äôt expect the same out of the C batch every year which is why o got 3 when it came out.  Age and proof are what makes this a great pour.
Haven‚Äôt been able to land any. I have A Batch with EC and A and B Batch with Larceny
I've heard it described as the A batches being sweeter, the B batches being oakier/tannic and the C batches being the more balanced of the three.
I wish I could get a pipeline to affordable ECBPs. I‚Äôve got an A123 and that‚Äôs it. Just had a pour of C923 this past weekend at a bar. Have some Private Barrrel too but man that C923‚Ä¶.YUM.
All right, I guess maybe its me reading too much into it. After seeing everyone ISO C923 and C922 and then with the Stagg 23C mentions, I started thinking maybe this ""C"" thing was more than it was...
B520 was legendary. I believe that was the most loved batch of the year!
Friends and I shared a bottle of A124 and we weren‚Äôt impressed.
Nah c920 and c921 were definitely the best still. My friend and i just did a blind of everything dating back to a520.
Well played.
Cs get degrees baby
It was the Stagg ""C23"" release that got me wondering after seeing it on EC and Larceny, and then someone told me they had Michter's 10 Rye but it was ""only the A batch"" and I started wondering about this whole batch name thing and if there is really any differences in the batches. 

I mean obviously, there will be nuances between every ""small batch"" release (which needs a formal definition IMHO) from any distilling producer, but I guess when I saw Stagg doing this it got me wondering if this is a gimmick across distillers.
I have also heard people raving on C922 and then Stagg came out with C23, etc. That's what got me thinking about this whole batch naming convention.
Larceny A124 is supposed to be very good. I have a bottle I haven't cracked yet, but I'm very much looking forward to trying it.
My understanding is C batches from the barrel proofs tend to be better but there‚Äôs no official ‚Äúc is going to kill it‚Äù from Heaven hill. My assumption is the release aligns up with bourbon heritage and fall releases so why not attempt to put your best foot forward. A124 is damn good this year so who knows what the B and C will be, but if C is the best this year I‚Äôm looking forward to trying it.
Michters 10 bourbon and Rye are single barrels not batches. And the letter just signifies the month of the release. To also add tho last years M10 Bourbon, it is speculated that the A barrels were older.

No these batched products are not gimmicks, they genuinely taste different from one another and some times drastically different.. Stagg(jr) has only done a C batch once,  that being 23C. Prior to that they have only ever do 2 batches a year.
It‚Äôs good, I liked both A and B batches. How the fuck did I get downvoted? I didn‚Äôt even say shit. Guess someone was made that I threw Larceny in. They‚Äôre pretty much the same shit.
People are weird man, I ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ya‚Ä¶have you tried a124? Best larceny BP I‚Äôve had yet.
Lol thanks. I haven‚Äôt, I have A123 and B523. Also have EC A123 which is .2 proof lower than Larceny A batch"
Review #7: RumCarthys American Single Malt,"
I'm a primarily bourbon and rye drinker, who enjoys the occasional scotch, generally something peated like Laphroaig or Ardbeg. I've never tried an ASM, they always seemed fairly expensive for what you got, and I hadn't heard great things about them. I also was not a fan of the rum barrel finished whiskey I had tried. All of this means when I first saw this come out, I had precisely zero interest in trying it. 

However, I kept seeing some very solid reviews of this bottle, so when I was making a shared pour anyways, I figured I might as well try it. It's made from peated malted barley, so I figured it'd be somewhat familiar. 


Age: 5 years 7 months

ABV: 61.4% (122.8 proof)

Mashbill: 100% peated malted barley

Price: $100

Tasted neat in a Neat glass

Nose: You can smell the rum influence right off the bat. The nose is sweet, rich, lots of fruit and toffee. There's the faintest hint of peat there too. Smelling this, I did not expect to like it. I generally don't like super sweet whiskeys, so while the nose smelled nice, I was very worried it would taste like it smelled.

Palate: The peat comes out of left field compared to the nose, but it doesn't smack you in the face like a cask strength Laphroaig. It's a very nice, campfire like peat, that mixes with the sweetness and fruit of the rum finishing brilliantly. The mouthful is very thick and complex, with the various flavors just layering on top of each other. The peat is definitely the star, but everything else compliments it's really well. The proof definitely helps with the thick texture, but there's no burn or ethanol, just uncut flavor. 

Finish: Man this thing has some legs on it. The finish is long and just more of the layered mouthful.  Smokiness and fruity desert influence just lingers for a while. The finish lingered so long it took me about 30 minutes to finish my 1.5-2 oz pour. If I had to pick one word to describe it, it was warm. The flavors just kind of worked their way all down your throat and you felt like you were sitting by a campfire eating blackberry cobbler. Not a hint of ethanol burn, just sweet and smoky flavor that didn't go away. 

Overall: If this is indicative of ASM, I'm a believer now. I know 2024 is young, but this is definitely the best bottle I've had this year, and I don't see it leaving the top 3 this year, maybe top 5 all time. It's not a bottle I'd reach for all the time, I still have to be in the mood for some peat, but this is the second best single malt I've ever had. The one bottle that beats this out is Laphroaig Cairdeas Triple Wood, but just by a hair. This bottle is almost perfect, the only thing holding it back for me personally is the temperament aspect. You're not always in the mood for peat, but that's ok. For a single malt, this is perfection, for a whiskey, it's really darn close.

Has anyone tried The Bouge Barrels Bougie's Bomb,"I recently came across a unique find at a local liquor store - a store pick of 'The Bouge Barrels Bougie's Bomb' rye whiskey  (9 year old rye). This brand is entirely new to me, and my attempts to dig up information online didn't yield much.

Unfortunately, the store's whiskey specialist wasn't available to shed light on this bottle. With its price tag sitting at a steep $110, I'm a bit hesitant to make a blind purchase.

Has anyone here had the pleasure of trying this particular rye? Any tasting notes, experiences, or general thoughts about the brand would be incredibly helpful. I'm curious about its flavor profile, how it compares to more well-known ryes, and whether it justifies its premium price.

Thanks!

First time trying these,"Went hunting again today and found these, looked in like 20 stores and only 1 store had 2 bottles of that mellow corn for $22 a bottle. Never seen it in person so I figured why not. Found a very dusty bottle of 1792 SB behind the counter of a store for $60, haven't seen one of those in person either so I scooped it up. As far as the Mercer/Prince goes, that was just a curiosity buy at $34. Watched a review that said it was decent and tasted like apples without any artificial flavoring, guess we'll find out. About to crack all 3 of them now and see what's up.

Thanks for reading","MFC!  You‚Äôll love it or hate it.  Lucky score on the 1792 SiB
I don't exactly hate it, it's just really thin and the after taste ruins it for me. It will get drank but I'm not a fan lol. The 1792 SB is tasty though, will fit in nice with the collection.
How was the corn?
Tad disappointing based off the hype, impossible to find here. I know it's only 22 bucks but I was expecting more. It's very thin and light on the palate which is alright for the price but that after taste just kills it for me. Can't really explain the after taste but it's just not great lol.
Thanks for review!
Np, if you have a question about anything I have, feel free to ask. It's all opened and enjoyed."
Collection fav's,My top 5 starting from the left.  32 bottles total in the collection.  Been in the hobby for about 2 years.  The Still Austin is the first bottle that I'm actually able to taste a lot of the flavor notes that reviewers have called out. Looking at my top 5 is it well rounded or do I have a type?    What's your top in your  collections?   Looking for bottle ideas.   ,"Big fan of Stellum Bourbon. I‚Äôve heard good things about the rye too but haven‚Äôt come across a bottle yet.
What do you think of the Blue run? I recently saw both 1 and 2 series but know nothing about them
Had the chance to grab that bottle!   Grabbed a bottle of Castle & Key small batch instead.   Very very bad decision.....
Very very smooth to be high proof.  Spicy, cinnamon with a sweet-ish finish.  Will always keep a bottle in the bar."
Finally got around to trying this‚Ä¶. Love it.,,"i‚Äôm personally a massive fan of irish whiskeys and green spot is a delightful introduction. i would also recommend redbreast 12!
Irish is the way to go.  Green spot was a really good one for the price
Green spots are a fantastic drop , especially the Leoville Barton edition
And then RB cask strength, if that‚Äôs your thing."
Nine banded,Got this barrel pick wheated bourbon yesterday and have only seen bad reviews on it but I like it a lot. I‚Äôm not a whiskey expert I just drink what I like don‚Äôt look for any specific notes or anything just if it taste good I drink it although I tend to lean towards over 100 proofs. Just curious if anybody here has tried any of their stuff and if you liked it. I know it‚Äôs a barrel pick and each barrel is gonna be a little different this is also my first wheated bourbon.,
Old Forester 1897 vs 1924,"Old Forester 1897 vs 1924

Sportsball got boring, so I decided it was time for a whiskey tasting.

Old Forester 1897 vs 1924 - assuming these need no introduction, both BiB, 1897 NAS - I paid $51.99; 1924 10yrs - I paid $124.99. Figured it would be fun to compare these 2 BiBs (I know, different mash bills) side by side.

1897 - fruit, slight alcohol burn on the nose. Spicey, caramel, & oak flavor notes. Long, spicey finish that lingers - finish is great! Drop of water opens up sweetness & fruit in palate.

1924 - sweet, butterscotch, & dark cherry on the nose. 
Fruit sweetness & creamy vanilla notes. Finish is enjoyable but over too quickly, dryer. Drop of water brings out oak, graham cracker flavors.

For me, 1897 has a nicer, longer finish. 1924 has a nicer nose & palate flavor notes. Purely based on tasting, I would nod to the 10yr. But considering how crazy ppl seem to be going for this bottle, I won't be replacing it. My state sucks - I saw the 1924 for $199 & $299 before finally I decided to over pay at $125. I'll get multiple other bottles instead.","I got the 1924 too. Glad I got it, won‚Äôt be replacing it.
Didn‚Äôt think 1924 was bonded. Being 100 proof doesn‚Äôt automatically make it one.
You're correct - not sure why I thought 1924 was BiB - could've sworn I read it somewhere, but can't find a source now.
Would be interesting if it was though. Can‚Äôt mix the stocks so to speak."
"Saturdays pickups! Weller full proof drop and also needed to buy a store pick to purchase. Weller was 79, dancing goat rye was 40","I am not disappointed at all with the dancing goat I was actually quite excited to get a rye as I haven't tried anything but the base JD rye and that was the most God awful tasting stuff I ever drank. Never heard of dancing goat before and they are out of Cambridge Wisconsin just a smaller scale family owned distillery. I've dived into the DG rye and I am amazed at how easy sipping and good it is, definitely get that cotton candy note they call for plus some other berries. If you see this 6 year on the shelf I'd recommend a pickup.",
A uniquely helpfully unhelpful review - Penelope Barrel Strength,"As a fun way to drink down more of my collection (about 80 bottles) I‚Äôve decided to do reviews of each. My goal with these is to get away from a numeric rating and provide a review that is totally subjective but still helpful in your decision on buying or trying something I‚Äôve reviewed. 

On to the glass! Penelope is one of my favorite bourbon brands. I like their juice and the marketing. I also like that it‚Äôs accessible in price and availability. To me, anything over $50 is a special occasion pour, so I like that they have widely available products above and below that line. 

To my knowledge, their bourbon is all sourced from MGP and Bardstown, which is fine because I like a lot of MGP and Bardstown. I‚Äôve spent a decent amount of time in Kentucky and toured Bardstown and I have to say that the hospitality there is top notch. Definitely make a point to visit if you are in the area.

I sampled this 113 proof bottle after 10 minutes resting. The nose is rife with boozy vanilla, like a bottle of baileys sitting in a cake bakery that is next door to a pastry shop. A tiny tiny bit of cinnamon and maple are in the mix but they are hiding deep underneath.

On the palate the sweetness party keeps rolling. This is neither overly saccharine nor is it a standout in terms of complexity. I get more vanilla and maple. If I allow it to linger then oak and tobacco start to poke their heads out. It‚Äôs got a hint of red fruit in there somewhere as well. I get all of the above and just a bit of honey on the finish.

Well the verdict is in. And this‚Ä¶is‚Ä¶bourbon. It definitely, totally is. I‚Äôd go so far as to say this bourbon bourbons. It‚Äôs a good solid pour that I enjoyed. This is the bourbon equivalent of that guy in your office whose name you almost remember‚Ä¶Justin, or John? It starts with a ‚ÄúJ‚Äù for sure. STEVE! That‚Äôs it. He lent you a buck for the vending machine once. He‚Äôs a good dude. This is a bottle you grab when you forgot what it tastes like and think maybe you have a new favorite on your shelf that you just forgot. Oh, wait, ok never mind. It‚Äôs good though.","Steve!

Can't stand that guy, actually. Always showing off his watch, his 3yo midrange luxury vehicle, and for some reason, his whiskey receipts.
I genuinely don‚Äôt understand the receipts lol

Like, why are you showing me what you paid?!"
Bulleit Single Malt,Just picked this up today and cracked it open for a taste. Amateur tasting notes in comments.,"Found at Total Wine for 59.97 before tax. 90 proof. 

I searched the archives and didn‚Äôt see any posts on this one yet, so thought I‚Äôd share my thoughts from the first pour. 

Color- dark straw

Nose- vanilla, cherry, light ethanol on deeper draws 

Palette- medium viscosity thicker mouthfeel. More heat than I would expect from the 90 proof (I lean towards barrel proof pours for reference), spices up front followed by lighter fruits and then dark, almost burnt caramel. It‚Äôs not the vanilla bomb that the nose makes me think it would be. 

Finish- fairly short, but balanced. Mostly spice is left over after 30 seconds or so.

Overall I‚Äôd give it an 8/10 and would welcome it into my rotation. 

Has anyone else tried this, and what did you get from it?
Just seen this at my local tonight. They just got it in today with the price tag of $59.99. Was getting on here to look if anyone has tried it and this was the first post in r/whiskey to load... nice amateur review, hahaha. Thanks bro!!
This is an interesting bottle that i‚Äôve never seen before.
Distilled in IN? Yellowstone sells an MGP single malt that‚Äôs pretty decent. It‚Äôs a fair bit higher in proof though I think.
I'd pick this up if it wasn't 60 bucks
It tastes like a Cross between their bourbon and a little bit of their rye. Probably due to the Bourbon style oak cask. It does have a little malt sweetness. But, If you're expecting more of a scotch-y like taste I don't think this is that. If I didn't know it I wouldn't think this was a single malt whiskey. IMHO the oak cask overpowers the barley single malt. Feels like a waste of 100% malted barley.
I‚Äôd try it! I‚Äôve never seen this before.
I‚Äôm very curious where they get this from. Sounds pretty good, but I‚Äôm still iffy on American Single Malts.

Kudos to making it an attractive bottle though. That alone will probably help sales, to a point.
Ah very cool. Big fan of this style. 

Other than barley, are American Single Malts regulated, meaning laws similar for bourbon or rye? 

It‚Äôs nice to see such a variety of these coming out.
FYI, regarding who actually distills Bulleit Single Malt, according to Chuck Cowdery it's definitely not a Bulleit distillery:

[http://chuckcowdery.blogspot.com/2024/02/bulleits-new-american-single-malt-is.html](http://chuckcowdery.blogspot.com/2024/02/bulleits-new-american-single-malt-is.html)

Cowdery apparently asked Bulleit who dunnit, and this is *their* response that he printed:

>*‚ÄúFitting the American Single Malt category guidelines, Bulleit American Single Malt was distilled by 1 distillery in Kentucky.*   
*Due to contractual obligations with our supply partners, we cannot share specific details, but as has always been the case, we work very closely with our distilling partners to ensure that Bulleit is made to our exacting standards and specifications.*  
*For further detail, we factor in working in partnerships with local distilleries to meet the growing demand for our whiskey that cannot be serviced by production at our distilleries in Shelbyville, KY or Lebanon, KY. Our distillers work closely with our distilling partners to ensure that Bulleit whiskey is made to our exacting standards and specifications.*    
*When we were first exploring Bulleit American Single Malt, the Lebanon, KY distillery was not operational and our Shelbyville, KY distillery was just getting started producing our signature Bulleit Bourbon at full capacity so we looked to an outside contractor to distill this product to our exacting specifications.*    
*We look forward to distilling and aging Bulleit American Single Malt at one of our world class facilities in the near future.‚Äù*

To me, the terms ""supply partners"" and ""our distilling partners"" might be the tells.
I just tried it for the first time. It tastes like nutrasweet and pills.
Anyone know if Bulleit does the actual distillation? Because I thought I read a while back that their 95 Straight Rye is distilled by MGP.
Thanks! I don‚Äôt think I have the practice in to do a great review, but the notes are what my tongue said, so might as well throw it out there!
I think it just released, like within the last couple days. OP is probably the first real review of it. Sounds interesting, unfortunately typical Diageo isn't saying a lot about it. Keep an eye out, I bet reps will be doing lots of tastings at bars and stores.
If nothing else, the olive colored glass is interesting on the shelf!
Label does not say- just that it‚Äôs ‚Äúbottled by Bulleit‚Äù. I read somewhere it may be related to that Yellowstone distillate, but I don‚Äôt know more than that.
My question too. I think MGP distills the Bulleit 95 Straight Rye.
Word. Can I just go ahead and get the ‚Äúthere‚Äôs better bourbon available for $20‚Äù comment out there? I wouldn‚Äôt disagree, but also fun to try something new to go along with the staples.
Glad to hear another perspective- thanks for sharing!
I hadn‚Äôt either prior to ordering it! I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth a pickup at list for something different.
It just launched, like this week.
I've picked up the Andalusia Triple Distilled and now the Bulleit Single Malt in the past couple of months and enjoyed both. My taste has favored higher proof bourbon generally, but I'm having some fun getting outside my regulars.
Good question- I did a bit of reading and it looks like the TTB proposed a rule change in 2022 to define the label of American Single Malt, but I can't find anything that says it went into place:

[https://www.ttb.gov/news/ttb-proposes-american-single-malt-whisky-standard-of-identity](https://www.ttb.gov/news/ttb-proposes-american-single-malt-whisky-standard-of-identity)

That being said, a lot of the American distilleries (including Bulleit, Stranahan, Andalusia, and others) are part of the ""American Single Malt Whiskey Commission"" which has the following rules:

\- 100% malted barley

\- Distilled at one distillery 

\- Mashed, distilled, and matured in the USA

\- Matured in oak casks not larger than 700 liters

\- 160 proof max distillation proof

\- Bottled at 80 proof or more

I assume any distillery that's part of this group would be following it's guidelines, so there's something:

https://www.americansinglemaltwhiskey.org/
So maybe MGP from a Kentucky plant? Are there other large scale contract distillers that could pull this off in KY?
I found this bit of info-- not conclusive by any means, but seems like it may be somewhere other than MGP:

Regarding the whiskey‚Äôs origin, the label says only ‚ÄúBottled By The Bulleit Distilling Co. in Louisville, KY‚Äù. However, there is no mention of where distillation took place. If the TTB labeling rules are being followed, if the bottling location is given and the spirit is distilled in that same state, then the exact location of distillation does not need to be stated. Therefore, Bulleit Single Malt was presumably distilled in Kentucky. There are rumors that it was distilled by MGP, but that should not be the case. So, where in Kentucky was this distilled? We can only guess.

Great review bro...I'm going back in the morning and grabbing this at my store. Thanks again!
I personally hate single malts but i‚Äôll try anything once.
I got the invite from TW‚Äôs Concierge a while back and ordered one since it looked new / different. Didn‚Äôt realize it wasn‚Äôt widely available yet, that‚Äôs pretty cool!
MGP does distill the rye. In theory this should be distilled in Kentucky, since that's the only state mentioned on the label. I generally trust Diageo to get that stuff right, but they've been careful to not address the source in the promotional material I've seen. Something to keep an eye on.
So down here in Tejas, American Single Malt is king. Andalusia Revenant Oak and Stryker, are both 50 bucks and probably way more complex and different than this guy, no offense to Bulleit. And Balcones, I'd argue holds its own to most Scotch that aive had
Maybe I'm over reacting.. just my first impressions. YMMV. :)
Oh, very good to know! Bulleit is my husband‚Äôs go-to so I think this would appeal to him as far as branching out a little.
Definitely, but it's deliberately been made unclear as to whom. From his post, Cowdery suspects Beam Suntory, Sazerac, Heaven Hill, Bardstown Bourbon Company, Newport's New Riff, and possibly Cascade Hollow (George Dickel) as the main distilleries, although he believes Cascade Hollow is the most ""natural"" suspect.

For me, Cowdery's last lines sum up my feelings perfectly:

>*""As I wrote here almost exactly ten years ago, ""There is no shame in being a non-distiller producer and if the actual producer won't let you reveal their identity, that's understandable too. The shame is in not being honest about it.""*  
*So, if you're interested in American Single Malts, maybe find a craft distillery near you that is actually making one, from scratch, in a still, like a real distillery.""*
Regarding the TTB labeling rules, my understanding is the regulations actually haven't kicked in yet and governing the production of ASMs. I believe it's still in the proposal stage and haven't been passed for lack of a better term. If so, ASM manufacturers can still play fast and loose with labeling, and be as misleading as they want.
Enjoy!
Love me some Andalusia!
Good to know!"
Battle of the Amburana‚Äôs.,"Battle of the Amburana

Blind tasting between 
Penelope Rio Batch 2 & RDOne Amburana

Nose:
Sample 1 sweet ethanol, with cinnamon raisin bread, wheat, deep, rich. 

Sample 2 a very similar profile, but lighter, fruitier, brighter, and a touch of dried apricots. 


Palate: 
Sample 1: lucious, slightly creamy mouthfeel, plums, baking spices, a touch of cinnamon, sweet but not overly.

Sample 2: sweeter, honey, cinnamon wheat toast, brighter, not as creamy, more complex with some notes I can‚Äôt quite put my tongue on

Finish: custard, burnt sugar, hardly and wood, spice. Shorter finish. 

Sample 1: dry, oak a touch of pepper, raisins, dark fruit, medium length. Nice warm hug

Final thoughts: This is a tough one. They are both fantastic pours, they are both similar yet different in n their own ways. My thoughts would be that sample 2 is Rio based on the honey on the nose and palate. If I had to choose one I think it would be sample 2 only because it‚Äôs brighter profile had the ever slighter edge for my liking. Though sample 1 had more of a punch. But if I‚Äôm right about sample 2 being rio, that could be because it‚Äôs lower proof and it‚Äôs been open a while & has about 1/3 the bottle left. Allowing air to change its profile. 

Ratings
Sample 1 : 81 out of 100. 
Sample 2: 85 out of 100. 


Winner by an extremely slim margin is sample 2!!!


Results: 
sample 1 is RDOne Amburana
Sample 2 is Penelope Rio. 

I can say this, if you see either of these bottles. Grab one or both. They are both very good. I know Amburana finished stuff isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. It‚Äôs sweet, cinnamon goodness. RDOne is a little more readily available currently. But Batch 3 Rio is coming very soon.",Was literally hunting for these both this week.  Thank you for the insights.  Have yet to see either out in the wild here in MA.  I will say the RD One sounds like more of my profile.
Best I‚Äôve Tried!!,Ben Holladay Rickhouse. I know it‚Äôs not in my crotch and I don‚Äôt know a lot about tasting notes. But this bottle is so good! Wish I knew how to explain it! Def worth picking up!!,"Wait until you try the Soft Red Wheat Rickhouse Proof also a knockout. Slainte‚Äô
Ive had the SRW LOVE it but cant find the Rickhouse anywhere.
Anything they have put out prior to the RH series was beyond fantastic but the RH series is just a symphony. I really don‚Äôt want people to find out about them because that will make it harder for me to even buy a standard 6YR bottle. But price and quality is an absolute banger every single time.
What floor was the juice made up of? I have heard 5 &6 floors have the gold.
I haven't had a bad Holladay.  I really want to get over to the distillery to get some of the cave bottles.
I‚Äôve been looking for it!!
Absolutely incredible
It‚Äôs batched between the floors.  From all the bottles that I have seen it‚Äôs always a mixture and never from a single floor.

Woodford Reserve OR Double Oaked for first buy?,"Have done some research lately and posted a few things here (thank you to everyone for helping me out!) and have decided to try Woodford Reserve as my 'first' since being on this forum. (Note: not technically my first as i have JD, Gentleman Jack and JD Single Barrel at home). Im tossing between which one to go with, the standard Woodford Reserve OR the Double Oaked Woodford Reserve. Found this good review on the 2: https://whisky-world.com/woodford-reserve-vs-double-oaked/ 
Im leaning towards the Double Oaked as i think the taste notes are more my style, and they are both the same proof. But was wanting some personal opinions from others if they have tried the 2 and what you guys would lean towards more üòä","I love the double oak and am looking to pick up another
I've had both and they are both very different, WR's standard bourbon isn't worth the price IMO, it's boring and tastes too much like ethanol for what it's worth but the double oaked is probably the best bourbon I've ever had, it's SUPER sweet and nice to drink. Both are more on the expensive side though, WR's bottles are made with expensive material so it jacks up the price unfortunately
Double oaked is awesome and unique. I‚Äôd start with that since you have some regular bourbon in the form of the JDSB
Double Oaked. No brainer.  I love the Woodford brand as a whole, but the DO is one I will always rebuy.
Double Oaked, hands down. Regular Woodford is just OK.
Cheers for the comments everyone! Will be picking up a Double Oaked today! üòä
The double-oaked all day, everyday if you can afford the premium over the standard Reserve. The double-oaked punches well above its price point. The double-oaked delivers a sipping experience more familiar to bottles in the $75-$100 price range -- maybe closer to $75 than $100, but still above its mid-range price point at $50. For how deep-bodied the palette and how long and smooth the finish is on the double-oaked, it has no business being $50. But yet here we are blessed.
Cheers for the comment mate! The double oaked flavour profile seems enticing and thats what im currently leaning towards. Price my way isnt too bad, within my budget range. Double Oaked might be the winner
Cheers, my pleasure. Yeah if it's within your price range go for that one. Even though it's $15 more the difference is substantial imo, it's well worth it. I'd be getting that bottle way more often if it was within my normal budget"
High West Midwinter Night‚Äôs Dram VS Cask Collection,"I thought I‚Äôd do a fun casual comparison between two whiskies by the same distillery that are ‚Äúsort of‚Äù similar or at least worth comparing thematically. It‚Äôs the battle of Rye finished in port barrels versus Bourbon finished in wine barrels. 

Midwinter Night‚Äôs Dram (MWND) needs no introduction and I imagine most people on this sub have already made up their minds about whether they like it or not. To quickly summarize: it is delicious, rich, bursting with dark red fruit, jammy, spicy, and warm with balanced oak. 49.3% abv and can be purchased for $150, though sometimes sold for over that. 

The Cask Collection is ‚Ä¶whelming. Mediocre. It‚Äôs $60 and at 50% abv.  It is a blend of straight bourbon whiskies finished in Cabernet Sauvignon barrels. I know that‚Äôs not the same as rye finished in port barrels but it‚Äôs reminiscent at least. And that‚Äôs where the similarities end. It tastes hot, a bit harsh, a little fruity. The classic bourbon notes of brown sugar, molasses, caramel, vanilla are muted. It‚Äôs lurking there but not strong. I guess I can sort of detect the wine finish but it‚Äôs not very distinct. It adds a slight touch of fruit and spice. Maybe. The finish is abruptly short with a bit of mustiness. 

I think I will finish the Cask Collection bottle but will not seek out another. I think High West‚Äôs Rendezvous Rye is better for the same price. Also Sagamore Sherry Finished Rye is better for the same price. M&G Port finished Rye is also better for only $40. 

I know people buy this bottle in the Costco value package which contains three bottles (one of which is this one) and for that special price perhaps it‚Äôs worth it. Otherwise at $60 I would hesitate to recommend it to any of my friends.",

Sure, hope you like banana. Carmel, oak, vanilla, and banana. Oh, and did I mention banana? Joke aside, it's really good. The JDSiBBP is even better, but this one is a great stepping stone.

It's a fantastic pour. Glad you liked it!"
What Happened to this Sub?,"Nothing but ""Did I get a good deal?"" or ""Look what Bourbon I found!"".

No tasting notes, no insight, nothing about history or where the world of whiskey may be going. May as well be talking about trading cards or Beanie Babies. Doesn't anyone care about anything other than what that bottle cost?","How are ‚Äúdid I do good?‚Äù posts still allowed is my question. It‚Äôs the number one reason my local bourbon page went to shit too.¬†
That's why r/bourbon is so strict even though people complain that it is. Saves us from what's happening here
This sub has always kinda sucked.  Try /r/bourbon (American bourbon, ryes, and other whiskeys), /r/scotch (self-explanatory), and /r/worldwhisky (Canadian, Irish, Japanese, etc. whiskies) for higher quality whiskey content.
What you don‚Äôt like seeing crotches, Apple Watches, and WSR?
‚ÄúHow‚Äôd I do?‚Äù is the worst. Like you need approval for the bottle you already bought? Followed by anything with ‚ÄúBoys / Gents / Lads / Fellas / etc ‚Ä¶‚Äù in the title, like the sub is some fucking boys club. There are almost 250,000 people in this sub, you really think that they are all men??
It's like Pokemon cards for adults at this point.
‚ÄúLook at my collection!‚Äù
Folks gotta downvote what they don't want to see more often. As long as they're getting upvoted instead, they'll keep happening since they get positive engagement on them.
Thank you. I‚Äôm sipping some Aberlour 12 for you, OP.
Folks that buy a bottle and ask, ""What are your thoughts?"" 

Idk... You tell us. You bought it. 

When people buy and show it off, it doesn't bother me. What bothers me is the MSRP bozos. So what if someone paid over MSRP for the bottle? It's their money, and they could do whatever they want. End of story. There is no need for the shaming. 

This bullshit notion that paying for shipping contributes to secondary. Well, spoiler alert: Gotta pay to get your booze delivered to you if it's not available in your area.

If you want to learn about what you are drinking and / or compare notes, there's always r/bourbon r/scotch and other subs for it. 

This sub has always been a shit show to begin with. I'm here for the banter. That's it.

Edit to add: Be upset at the mods for not controlling it, not the folks posting. Misguided anger.
The pics of aisles with ‚Äúwhat should I buy?‚Äù posts are the worst. 

Like how the fuck should I know what you should buy? What‚Äôs your budget? What are your preferred tasting notes? What have you tried before and haven‚Äôt liked? Etc‚Ä¶

Read the label. Pull up a review. Pick the prettiest label or bottle. Pick something, drink it, then share your thoughts.
I've started blocking the people that just spam the same btac posts and my experience has greatly improved.
Should rename it crotchshot
Not to mention California Costco finds!
This sub has always been like this. Always. Serious discussion is on r/scotch and r/bourbon.
Thoughts?? This particularly frustrates me, c‚Äômon guy you‚Äôre the one with a bottle wtf do you think?
I see these posts on Facebook groups, too. Crotch shots galore holding a bottle of whiskey waiting for likes and comments.
You're so right.

In addition to what you said, personally I'm annoyed by the lack of Scotch and Irish Whiskey posts on ... /r/Whiskey for crying out loud. It's all bourbon in here lately.
r/whiskey has been this way for more than a year. It doesn‚Äôt matter if people bitch out, things won‚Äôt change. You want karma? Looking for upvotes? Post a bottle of Buffalo Trace, Weller, Blanton‚Äôs and EH Taylor, bonus if you post it in your car.
It's been like this for years now. Nothing really new.¬†
This sub has 4 mods of which only 2 are recently active. To contrast that, r/bourbon has 5 mods of which 4 are recently active and regularly contribute. Maybe this sub needs more active moderation?
Parking lot Beamer crotch shots are the trend.  Bruh
It‚Äôs the closet wanna be influencers who need attention. These guys should stick to tik tok.
Blasphemy‚Ä¶ you better not call out a tater. Or comment how many bottles they have open. They will strike back with down votes.

Some people just like to watch the world burn. 

What ever happened to getting a nice bottle enjoy it with some friends and have a good time. Make a memory. 

The other option is die and let someone sell it not knowing what they have or drink it themselves.
Yep.  This sub blows now.
Glad someone finally called this out. Was starting to wonder why people were seeking validation for a bottle they were likely not to ever even open.
I don't have friends who are into whiskey, no need to rub it in üò≠
This community is pretty toxic.  Not sure what you were expecting on Reddit
I was annoyed when I first discovered what this sub was but I just embrace the potato at this point.¬†
This sub is just mainly bourbon, ""what should I buy"", ""Did I do well"" and some rage bait. There's not much diversity but it does allow for some interesting discussions when collections come up; you get to discuss some bottles that you may not have heard of, recommendations based on what you have and the like as well as some discussions on the batches.

I quite like just showing what I've bought, and getting people's opinions, tasting notes and recommendations. This sub can foster some great discussions but they're seldom. 

If you really want tasting notes, go to r/bourbon, r/scotch and r/worldwhisky.
Hey man! I post reviews!
It seems to me that the ‚Äúhow did I do‚Äù? Posts are one of a few things. ‚ÄúShowoff‚Äù, or testing the waters to see if it‚Äôs worth drinking or should be put up for trade or sale. I saw a couple today on a FB group. That it was obviously their intension to find out if the bottle was good enough to open or should they just pass it on to get something else in trade. Either way it doesn‚Äôt make sense. I don‚Äôt buy bottles I don‚Äôt intend to open. But so many people only buy bottles to swap or upgrade. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Makes it hard for guys that actually want to drink the hard to find stuff near impossible.
If this has anything to do with my Red Spot post I was just excited. I'll post a tasting note after I try it (and I was courteous enough to exclude my crotch from the shot).
LOOK I BOUGHT WELLER BUT WON'T DRINK IT.

LOOK I BOUGHT BLANTON'S BUT WON'T DRINK IT.

LOOK I BOUGHT STAGG BUT WON'T DRINK IT.

You can‚Äôt even blame the people posting these posts, it‚Äôs completely on the mods for allowing it.
People take reddit WAY too seriously.

There's no insight to give. It's whiskey.

The history is cool, I agree. You want that, go to Chuck Cowdery's blog.

Tasting notes and posting reviews are just masturbation in text form. Everyone's palate is different and subjective.

This place is literally good for nothing except whiskey porn. Who would expect anything else? And yes - like Beanie Babies or trading cards, this stuff is a frivolous luxury good.
Ah yes, the weekly tears about this sub, when there's a bourbon sub and a scotch sub that has exactly what you're after
Idk, I get the ""how'd I do posts"" people are excited and want to show others what they got. I think more effort to pair their thoughts on how the bottle tastes and what not would go a long way towards improving things though

If you guys were my actual friends and I scored a great bottle, I'd want to share the excitement with you and hope you'd be excited about it too - which could lead to further discussion about it. I'm just not sure I see the problem.
Unfortunately this sub has always been this way
have to agree with you
I get my fix of whiskey reviews from r/bourbon and this one is for casual flex posts and whatnot.
It's ageing
>""Did I get a good deal?"" or ""Look what Bourbon I found!"".

Don't forget about all the crotch shots!

/r/cigars has a thing, ""Look at all the cheap cigars I bought!""
The mods here apparently don't care.....
The better question is who is voting those up rather than down?  I know it isn't me.

This shouldn't be the mod's responsibility.  This is reddit, not a newspaper.
Thanks for the tip, I had no idea
Yeah, I'm glad they're strict.  Just wish it was not limited to bourbon.  I enjoy a wide range of whiskey.
Oh awesome. Now I can leave this pointless sub and join there.
r/bourbon seems very strict to me as well. I once started a post asking what's the ideal number of glasses for a flight. I'm still somewhat new to whiskey and I once did one of 5 whiskies, and that was way too many for me, it all got convoluted, etc. So I asked what the ideal size was.

I think there were maybe 2-3 replies before the mods took it down, and I didn't see any rule I broke. I did see the part where the mods can delete whatever it wants to (üôÑ) but I didn't get any kind of feedback what it was I did wrong. So to me, r/bourbon very much seems to be a review sub only, which IMO is pretty boring.

Edit: I'm also still new to reddit so I'm still navigating all this.
The problem is their mods are all self-important, humorless dicks.  

I came here to get away from r/bourbon.  But yeah‚Ä¶ the daily ‚Äúhow‚Äôd I do?‚Äù Or ‚Äúis this whiskey I just bought any good?‚Äù Is getting old
Instant sub thanks I mean I love seeing people find some good buys like that post about the eh Taylor and the ammunition that was a dope find but I feel like it's most the posts I see on here
Thanks for the sub suggestion. I've now joined.
Maybe we should start an equivalent to /r/showerbeer for that. R/whiskeycrotch?¬†

I‚Äôve been fighting that battle for a while now. I feel like I‚Äôm the only one in the trenches though
I completely agree.  It isn't just this sub, all of reddit has continuously gone down hill since they killed the original reddit model and introduced moderators about 16 years ago.

The whole point of the voting and hiding system was specifically so that you could self moderate the site for yourself.
The 12 is always great! (The A'bunadh is my favorite though.)
Love this response. I‚Äôve seen the posts about people stalking the Costco liquor aisle for releases. I‚Äôd rather over pay by $50 and not waste my time. I do like hearing some of the opinions on mid priced whiskey on here though.
If they're buying something just to show off or act stupid instead of providing some input, then yea, they should be ashamed.
I don‚Äôt even look at these
I changed my mind, these are actually the worst.
The mental image of someone standing in the aisle refreshing a reddit post every 5 seconds before making a decision is pretty hilarious
I have to admit I did this a few times. But in my defense. It was when I was still very new to whiskey. And I literally had no clue what I should buy. So I can side with these posts if & only if you are new and really don‚Äôt know what to buy, or what‚Äôs a good price. But you should at least state your budget & likes or dislikes. But also at the same time. By the time someone usually sees the post and answers. Is the OP really still at the store waiting? Doubtful
Was literally coming in here to bitch about exactly this type of post, before unsubbing, and this post was at the top of the sub. So tired of pics of random liquor store walls filling my feed.
There is a sub for that too r/costco_alcohol.
Scotch is not well received content here. I‚Äôve posted reviews about scotch and Irish whiskey before but when I post about Buffalo Trace or Blanton‚Äôs boy the upvotes keep raining.
Add /r/scotch to your rotation.
I mean you haven‚Äôt posted anything about Scotch or Irish whiskey either.
At least some tiktokers open their stuff and give speed run reviews.
Crack it when you are ready.

Edit: To be bent out of shape. Goofy ass r/whiskey sub.
>Tasting notes and posting reviews are just masturbation in text form. Everyone's palate is different and subjective.

Still better than a crotch shot, how‚Äôd I‚Äôd do!
For that, there‚Äôs r/scotch.
You see reviews on Canadian whiskey like found north all time
r/bourbon does bourbons, ryes, American single malt, Canadian or Canadian sourced whiskeys, light whiskeys, sour whiskeys, Japanese whiskeys. Plenty of bottles to review.  

r/scotch does scotch and Japanese whiskeys
That would be exponentially more interesting than most posts here and would at least generate conversation.
I don‚Äôt understand what question you were asking. How many drinks to have before a flight? To get drunk?
I'm relatively new to whiskey (3 years) and very new to reddit and I tend to agree with both of your stances there. Since I'm new, I'm looking for more education on whiskey, and frankly reviews don't do it for me for the most part.
/r/WhiskeyDick
r/whiskyporn is what you're looking for.
r/whiskeycrotchshots exists, but not very active.
And Mercedes and some Porsche
I feel the opposite.  I might have an interest about a person's tastes.  Not an interest in someone photographing a bottle they just bought asking if it was worth buying.  

If they were photographing a bottle they just got because it is their favorite or whatever, then that would be different.
Nice and hot
Got shit for paying over msrp and shipping for a bottle of ECBP C923. Total was $130 after taxes and shipping. What the hell did they expect? Build a relationship with an online retailer to have the shipping fee waived?
What do you mean by act stupid? Are you referring to the ""How did I do"" posts or something else? I think they are silly, but nothing to get bent out of shape for.
Thank you. I just did! Looks good.

(It's not even that I dislike Bourbon either, it's just a complete overkill of bourbon posts in here)
You must be new to this world
Okay?
Is it though?
A ""flight"" is a tasting involving several small glasses of whiskey (or beer, wine, etc).
No, not *before* a flight. *For* a flight.
Pictures of some guy holding a bottle next to his steering wheel also don‚Äôt do it.
Fair point. It just seems to me like a lot of the ‚Äúcollection‚Äù posts all have the same unopened allocated bottles.
Think of it as more of an eye rolling event rather than a steam coming out of my ears kind of thing.  To say ""bent out of shape"" would be an exaggeration.
Usually due to higher American presence on reddit therefore resulting in more posts of bourbon
Yeah while subjective and personal preference are a factor, a review still provides information and insight at times. These watch / steering wheel / crotch shots are pointless played out poor humor at best.
Thank you. I‚Äôve never heard of that term.
Yea.  I think there is a lot of over lap.
In my neck of the woods, bent out of shape, is a phase to describe someone in their feelings because they were annoyed by something so silly. I guess it has different meanings from place to place. Anyway, I find it kind of odd that folks on here are emotionally invested in something so trivial, like booze. That's just my opinion on it.
> a review still provides information and insight at times.

The only useful information I've ever seen in reviews is deets on provenance that the manufacturer isn't in a hurry to share, especially if they're an NDP.
Ah... In my experience it references when someone looses their temper over something.  ie.. literally ""bent out of shape"" when they gesture wildly, yell and grimace.  So ""slightly annoyed"" wouldn't fall into that classification.
I dunno I just taste whiskey myself and form my opinion but do like to see comparison reviews to see if someone got similar results. It‚Äôs useful info to me.
¬†
For example I just picked up Abasolo Mexican corn whiskey and wondered if I was crazy for getting hints of tequila in it. Found a great Reddit comment doing a write up and they mentioned it as well along with confirming other tasting notes I got. To me it was helpful.

Crotch shot asking is this Mexican whiskey any good isn‚Äôt doing anything for me.
Yeah, I mean I agree the ""how'd I do?"" shit is stupid, but I'm all for the ""lookit this cool shit"" posts."
Mitchers or Sazerac for quintessential rye,"I don't have a rye yet in my collection and would like to pick up one that represents a quintessential rye. I keep seeing Mitchers and Sazerac on this topic. At my local store, Sazerac is $55 and Mitchers is $100. Is Mitchers worth almost double the price? What are the big differences between them?

Edit: Should have included, prices are in CAD, and we have pretty [limited selection in Manitoba](https://www.liquormarts.ca/search-products/all?search_api_fulltext=rye&field_country_and_region=All&field_store_inventory=All&field_category_type=All&field_closure_type=All&field_container_type=All&field_package_size=All&field_packaging_material=All&field_tasting_profile=All&number%5Bmin%5D=&number%5Bmax%5D=&f%5B0%5D=country_and_region%3A340)

Edit: y'all might be disappointed but I went with Lot 40 Canadian Rye. Had nothing but good [reviews](https://www.liquor.com/best-canadian-whiskies-5086370#toc-best-rye-lot-40-canadian-rye-whisky) online and a 100% rye mashbill. Obviously won't be the finest rye on the market, but for the price, seemed to be an good choice. Bulleit was the alternative I was going between, but I've tried a couple drams of that and wanted to try something new.","I would say neither would be considered the quintessential rye. When I think rye, I generally think of MGP‚Äôs 95-5, but that might be because of how ubiquitous it is.
Rittenhouse
Michter's is pricier but offers a deeper, smoother flavour. Sazerac is more affordable and hits classic rye notes, perfect for both drinking and mixing. If you value a rich taste and can stretch the budget, Michter's might appeal to you. However, for a straightforward, traditional rye that's easier on the wallet, Sazerac is a solid pick.
I like Michters much more than Sazerac but it's still a $40-50 bottle for me. Are you sure the $100 bottle is just michters straight rye?
Can you get old forester 100? The others are ‚Äòbarely rye‚Äô bulliet would be a more true ‚Äòrye‚Äô as well.
Real bummer you can't find Rittenhouse because that would be the best option.¬†


In my highly subjective opinion, Michter's kinda tastes like a mix of Sazerac and Rittenhouse.¬†


Rittenhouse brings more char and oak notes, while Sazerac has more honey and vanilla. Michter's has both, which is great, be but it's just so much more expensive.¬†


I would probably just start with the Saz and then do the Michter's next. Saz is a classic.¬†


But if you don't mind spending the money, Michter's is very good.¬†
Not a fan of michters standard rye offering. I had to pick between the two I would go for the Saz.
unfortunately not available where I'm from. I'll keep an eye out for it if I'm travelling!
will keep an eye out for this next time I'm travelling, but it's [not sold in Manitoba](https://www.liquormarts.ca/search-products/all?search_api_fulltext=rittenhouse&field_country_and_region=All&field_store_inventory=All&field_category_type=All&field_closure_type=All&field_container_type=All&field_package_size=All&field_packaging_material=All&field_tasting_profile=All&number%5Bmin%5D=&number%5Bmax%5D=)
Yeah if michters rye is 100 it's either the toasted barrel (in which case buy it right now) or the pricing is ridiculous and you can find it for around 50 dollars. 

That said imo, michters rye is leagues better than sazerac. But I'm sure some people will disagree
No Old Forester here, but we do have Bulleit
u/NewEnglandLighthouse u/Nervous-List3557 it is indeed the [Single Barrel Straight Rye](https://www.liquormarts.ca/product/michters-single-barrel-straight-rye-whiskey/750-ml) vs our [$55 sazerac](https://www.liquormarts.ca/product/sazerac-straight-rye-whiskey/750-ml)
That would be a more traditional rye I think
Ahh I see your edit and that all makes sense now. I would reach for the michters and see if that price is worth it to you. Also, Found North is a Canadian distillery and they have what I've heard is a pretty amazing rye- their whiskey is more expensive but it might be more cost effective up there. Enjoy!
Interesting. Not available in Manitoba but I‚Äôll keep it on my watch list. Their Calvados finished rye sure sounds interesting!"
Smoke Wagon,"Another short and sweet review. Have to say having read reviews I was exepecting a very different experience than I got. I expected something like the Smoke Head Scotch I‚Äôve enjoyed but this was far more mellow.

The nose was mild bourbon but an initial strong alcohol burn.

The taste was far more mellow, oak and leather at the front slowly giving way to the usual bourbon vanilla and cinnamon. 

In all, not worth what I had to pay to get it (the joys of living in the Uk) but one I will enjoy again.","Don't feel too bad, I live in Kansas and we just got this into the state for the first time in January. Are there any American whiskey brands over there decently priced?
In Ireland here, what site did you use to get it to UK? I brought a bottle home with me from the states but would like another
Eagle Rare is easy to find and reasonable priced, same with Buffalo Trace.
I used The Grand Whisky auction site. They do auctions every month.
Bro that's fucking hilarious, eagle rare goes for $99.99 and buffalo trace as high as 49.99 here in Kansas, people over value the hell out of buffalo trace products
They were on special in Tesco over Christmas got them for ¬£16 a bottle."
Whisky I bought for a non-whisky drinker friend for his birthday.,"My friend only drinks beer so I decided to gift him some whisky, hopefully initiateing a new whisky enjoyer. This Dewar's Portuguese Smooth was perfect for this occasion. Not only it's cheap here in Poland as it was only 17$, it also comes with really neat rocks glass and nice box. The whisky itself should fit his taste - port finish makes it sweet and full of notes easy to recognize for him. Have you tried it? What other bottles would you consider approachable and affordable for non-whisky drinkers, both scotch and bourbon?","For non whiskey drinkers I‚Äôd recommend a spirit they do enjoy or a beer they enjoy‚Ä¶ In my experience people don‚Äôt like having things forced on them
I see. You may be right. I hope he'll like it haha. One should try new things from time to time.
Yeah but it depends. U get me a Yager I would say thanks and will regift it. Same with wheat whisky. Just not my thing. Same could be for your buddy."
Looking for new flavors,"First off, I don‚Äôt have fun tasting notes or a cool review of the 1924. Sorry.
Lately, I‚Äôve been branching out and trying different flavors. But, I always end up going back to the Woodford Double Oaked. It‚Äôs got such a different taste than any of the other bourbons I‚Äôve tried. To me, it taste like drinking a toasted marshmallow.
There are plenty of things I like about the other brands. The Bib & Tucker has a funk to it, (maybe the high rye?) but I dig it. I like the up-front sweetness of BT, and the red wine-like dry finish of the Angels Envy. The OF 1924 and EC taste great, but nothing jumps out at me like with the Bib and Tucker or Woodford. Maybe I have bad taste in bourbon, but the Eagle Rare is probably my least favorite of the bunch. I‚Äôd like to try a wheated bourbon. I figured Maker‚Äôs Mark would be a good start there.
Based on that information, does anyone have a recommendation on what I should try next?","Given your interest in wheated bourbon like Maker's Mark, try Maker's Mark 46 French Oaked, which offers a delightful twist with French oak staves. If you enjoy Woodford Double Oaked, you might like the classic Woodford Reserve for its balanced and sophisticated profile. Cheers to your whisky journey! ü•É
Rare breed
Since you mentioned makers, the Maker's 46 French Oaked is easy to find and pretty tasty - cask strength even better.

I love the Woodford double Oaked as well - peerless double Oaked is harder to find in my experience but also good...and there is of course this year's release of the woodford double double Oaked. If you can find one.

Too many others to mention at once, it's a huge whiskey world out there, good luck!
Bib&tucker double char is so good beats double oak imo
Add JD 10 or 12 to that collection of deliciousness‚Ä¶‚Ä¶enjoy
Larceny BP for Oaky there‚Äôs always 1910.  Also for super oaky try bondstone triple oak at TW. It was too oaky for my taste but maybe you‚Äôll like it.
Different bottles that are readily available that always compete against the overly expensive stuff: KC12, 4R (try em all), Michters Small Batch, Rare Breed, AE rye, Seagrass Rye, ECBP. For some of the higher proof stuff, try it on a big rock of ice or a little water to help get over the proof.
Makers Mark 46 Cask Strength. Or perhaps Old Forester 1910 since you like WR Double Oak. I do like the WRDO more though.
I've introduced many friends to Barrel Seagrass. If you're looking for flavors/tasting notes you won't find a bourbon or rye with more to catch and keep your interest. The first time friends try it the look on their faces after each sip is of surprise and delight. So amazing from an amazing company.
I've not noticed debris in bottles before. May be the batch or ? Try looking in a different store.
I will definitely keep an eye out for the double double oaked!
I'm pretty sure the double double oak is distillery only.
I‚Äôve not seen this one yet. Sounds amazing though!
I‚Äôve heard the 1910 is all bananas. Which is right up my alley. Definitely a future addition!
This is exactly what I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôm not particularly looking for ‚Äúthe best‚Äù. I just want to have a great variety, that I can share with friends and talk about. I‚Äôve heard good things about the seagrass and dovetail. I‚Äôll definitely grab a seagrass next time I‚Äôm out.
Went to pick up a bottle of Seagrass and noticed that every bottle has a lot of debris in it. Is that normal?
Glad I held off on that one then. Thanks for the help!
I believe you're right..distillery and online...I wasn't fast enough to purchase the online bundle the other day, not too surprised given the quantity made available.."
Looking for recommendations,"New to tasting. Previously worked in the wine industry, so I‚Äôm not a total newbie to how my palate reacts, and feel fairly confident in what I like and what I don‚Äôt. So far, the High West Double Rye is my favorite. Lean more towards Rye because I prefer more crisp, spicy notes, but I know the reputation of Bourbon is worth exploring. Really like the AE so far (just picked it up this last week), and I‚Äôm looking for more recommendations based on the above info. Excited about exploring new bottles, even if my wallet hurts a little. Prefer recommendations on bottles under $75 for now. Got a wife and a dog to feed, and it‚Äôs hard enough spending snot on myself, let alone anything ultra top shelf. Cheers brothers.","AE was my intro, Always a special place for me personally, so I keep a bottle on hand at all times. High West DR, one of my faves and my daily sipper. For under $75, try WT Rare Breed (on most shelves)‚Ä¶so good! Jefferson‚Äôs Reserve SiB ($60). Cannot wait to buy the michter‚Äôs Rye, reviews say one of the best!
it‚Äôs only a few dollars over your max, but i too love rye and am thoroughly impressed by old ezra 7 full proof. heard good things about pikesville, which is a lot cheaper, but haven‚Äôt had the chance to try it myself. if you want a real bang for your buck, rittenhouse at ~$27. hard to beat michter‚Äôs but i do understand the desire for a higher proof. ill have to try the high west
If you have a preference for rye whiskey with crisp, spicy notes like High West Double Rye, here are some recommendations, all under $75:

**Bulleit Rye**: It's got that bold and spicy kick, with just a hint of sweetness.  
**Knob Creek Rye**: This one's all about being rich and full-bodied, a real treat.  
**Wild Turkey 101 Rye**: It strikes a perfect balance between spicy and sweet, making it a versatile choice.

  
Hope you find these suggestions enjoyable on your whiskey adventure! Cheers! ü•É
Angels Envy rye is my favorite pour. It‚Äôs finished in rum barrels so it has a wonderful sweetness to it, like candy.
I recommend Russell's Reserve single barrel rye.¬† I enjoy it more than the rare breed.¬† I see it for around 60 dollars."
Noob advice,"So i bought a tomatin 14 year port cask, all reviews say how sweet it is with fruits and toffee and berry flavor. I for the life of me only taste alcohol. I know im ""drinking"" it wrong. Any tips on how to enjoy scotch? Or am i just not a scotch person?","Take it slow.  Let it rest for a couple of minutes before you start tasting it.  There is an old phrase, ‚ÄúA minute in the glass for each year in the cask.‚Äù  That would be 14 minutes, but it really shouldn‚Äôt need that long.

Take very small sips. Add a few drops of water.  If it is still too strong, add a little more.  You should notice flavors changing as you do that. You probably shouldn‚Äôt need to add any more than a teaspoonful.

When you‚Äôre nosing it and all you are getting is alcohol, move it away from your nose a bit until the alcohol scent dies down.
I had the same experience when I first started on my whiskey journey.  I would read about the amazing tasting notes on certain whiskies, but I only smelled and  tadted alcohol. 
It does take a while to get used to the alcohol and start picking up these other flavors. 
As others have said, take it slow. Take small sips. Add water a little at a time,  before long you will notice sweetness, then some spices.
  For me, i get apple and pear flavors from Scotch, chewing gum and artificial fruit flavors from Irish and baking spices and vanilla from bourbon. 
There are lots of other, more specific flavors I get from certain whiskeys.
I've also found that trying different types of whiskies in the same sitting will help to understand the differences between the regions. Examples: after drinking scotch bourbon is very  sweet.  After drinking bourbon,  i could pick up some brine in Bunnahabhain scotch.

Enjoy the journey!
All you taste is alcohol? It's only 46 percent alcohol. It may be you just don't like whiskey made from malted barley, which is traditionaly what scotch is made from.
Add a little ice
https://youtu.be/WEC8CSVd-8w?si=7ua8Cp49FJB_4kAg
This is it. Just take your time and don't give up. Try different bottles and types of whiskey, starting from lower shelf. It'll take some time but it will surely be worth it. Cheers friends!
I know its not strong but i get the fumes and the unpleasantries and none of the flavor.
""Hello.  How are you? Quite well""
Try another scotch but pick an unfinished one. It may be you just done like scotch, which is reasonable."
Birthday Tastes,"Cheers out there. I‚Äôll add tasting notes if I feel like it.

I hope you‚Äôre having some delicious sips tonight.","Hmmmm, I've never seen a double oaked in that bottle.
It‚Äôs the old one
Frankly, I‚Äôd be further along on that bottle, but contrary to popular consensus, it doesn‚Äôt line up well w my palate. Too tannic / drying for me

I think tonight will be Elijah Craig compare (Toasted, B923, Private 128 proof)"
Still Austin Cask Strength,"How???? How is this stuff 58%??? 

Because except for the mouthfeel it drinks at like 35%! I hate using smooth as a descriptor but this stuff is SMOOTH. I personally don‚Äôt think the flavor is anything to write home about - probably because of its age, but damn is it an easy sipper

Tasting notes:

Nose: Caramel, Sunflower Seeds
Palate: Super-sweet caramel, maple, medium-heavy mouthfeel
Finish: Nonexistant","This is honestly one of the biggest challenges I have when people ask for recommendations for ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù whiskey. Much of my collection is cask strength, and IMO a lot of those bottles drink smoother than the 80-90 proof bottles I have.
I‚Äôm a big fan of their Cask Strength Bourbon and Cask Strength Rye.

Maybe the most underrated aspect of these superb bottles is that they‚Äôre also reasonably priced!

One of the best values in American whiskey IMO
I visited their distillery last year and had a flight. Really enjoy all their offerings, even the gin was tasty. But yeah, the cask strength musician is definitely my favorite. Will probably always have a bottle in the bar.
I would agree with your flavor notes, but IDK what sunflower seeds taste like since im allergic. But it is way too smooth. I say it drinks like a Bonded bourbon if you really try to find a burn.
The sunflower seeds you eat are encased in inedible black-and-white striped shells, also called hulls. Those used for extracting sunflower oil have solid black shells.
I mean that's great, I still don't know what they taste like."
Very old Barton - Review of my first dram.,"This is also the first time I've attempted to write a proper whisk[e]y experience.  Feel free to add your thoughts on my review!

I sipped this as I do most of my drams, neat.  This time of year that means the temperature is around 64¬∞ where the whiskey is stored and thus, an approximate pour temperature. 

Clean floral nose.  Reminded me of a natural fabric softener.

I was initially hit by a strong spice which enveloped my mouth and throat in a manner which went beyond taste. Vanilla and cinnamon developed into an earthen fruitiness that lingered with a slightly dry, pleasant numbness.

There was more flavor and complexity than I expected from the bottle given it's position on the shelf.

Pretty happy with a 1.75 liter for under $40 here in limited choice-rural West Virginia, and thankful for the recommendation to try it out!

Have you tried this? What did you think if so? 

Any other bottom shelf sleepers I shouldn't sleep on?","The 86 proofer is a good mixer. For sipping, the 100 proof is my preference. The 100 proof in a blind does better than many expect.
What bottle would you compare this to? In score or maybe flavor profile, similar quality etc?
Rebel 100 is a slept on bottom shelf wheater.
I did a comparison between Very Old Barton 100 and 1792 Full proof, and they were too close to call"
Need whiskey recommendations for a newish whiskey drinker!,"I've tried makers mark- wasn't a fan
I liked Buffalo Trace
The offerings from Basile hayden are good, but expensive for what they are 
Didn't like Jim Beam double oaked.
My current favorite is wild turkey 101.
Any other good ones i can try, that have more of a Carmel note rather than tasting like i licked an oak barrel?ü§£","Knob Creek 9 year, Russell's Reserve 10 year, Green River, Woodford Reserve, Early Times Bottled in Bond, Old Forester 100 (orange label), Four Roses small batch or single barrel

Angel's Envy Rye
I disagree with the 1792 Small Batch, trash IMO.  I'd definitely recommend Elijah Craig. Delicious, available, and < $35.
1792 small batch, maybe rare breed if you like WT.
Try Scotch, Irish & Japanese and see which style you enjoy most first.

Green Spot & Redbreast 12 are excellent Irish whiskies, Jameson is good if you just want to try the style for cheap.

Scotch has a tremendous amount of variety, but Glenfiddich 12 is always a good choice for a starter Scotch.

I'm not versed in Japanese so I cannot recommend anything, but I'm sure someone more knowledgeable will come along.
Larceny or Old Grand Dad 114
‚Ä¢Old Grandad Bonded or 114

‚Ä¢Sazerac Rye (Baby Saz is a sweeter rye)

‚Ä¢Evan Williams Bottled In Bond

‚Ä¢Russell‚Äôs Reserve

All these bottles should be accessible and btwn $15-$30

Also, consider small format bottles (200ml/flask & 375ml) before paying for a standard 750ml
I've tried quite a few bourbons so far and I might get judged for this but my 2 favourites right now are nothing fancy, widely available and not expensive.  Those 2 are Evan Williams small batch, and wild turkey both the 81 and the 101 are great. They make a great old fashioned, they are great neat, and go great with a coke. I haven't tried russles yet, but Eddie Russel is the master distiller behind wild turkey. I haven't tried basil Hayden's but I heard it was the same mash bill as old grandad don't get me wrong old grandad is good whiskey, there's just nothing about it that stood out to me to make me wanna buy it again other than the bottle looking kinda cool. I like the buffalo trace line up, even there cheap stuff like ancient age is good, I've had benchmark which I didn't care for but it's still quality whiskey made from non GMO grains. I haven't tried the rest of the benchmark line up, I hear the rest of them are pretty good for the price like the full proof, and whatever the rest of them are.
I know you said caramel but try Isaac Bowman Port Barrel finish ... my favorite is buffalo trace by a mile due to its flavor and mellowness. my second, price point wise,  is The Isaac Bowman PF... if you've got extra cash the smoothest and great flavor profile I've had is Calumet Farm 15 year. I've tried many and like many more but if I'm drinking neat or just an ice cube these are the best imo.
If you're looking for a sweeter profile with caramel notes, Woodford Reserve is a great choice. It offers a balanced combination of sweetness and woody flavors, along with hints of caramel and vanilla.  
  
Elijah Craig Small Batch is another option for those who like sweetness without an overwhelming oakiness. It features a delightful blend of caramel, vanilla, and a touch of spice.  
  
For a more complex and well-rounded sweetness, consider trying Four Roses Single Barrel. This bourbon offers a diverse range of flavors, including caramel, vanilla, and fruity notes.

Hope this helps ü•É
These are my recommendations for beginners. There are many more than this but it gives a good base. I like to try a couple from each category to see similarities then compare across categories to see differences. 

Bourbon is going to be the most common in US. It‚Äôs also usually the cheapest for similar quality just due to shipping of casks/bottles. Some I like to recommend are Buffalo Trace (don‚Äôt spend more than $30-35 for a bottle), 1792 small batch, Makers mark (Wheated bourbon), wild Turkey, and Four Roses Single Barrel. As you get use to the alcohol you can move up in proof. WT101 is a classic. Most Bottled-in-bond are good. They are all 100 proof. Old Forrester 1920 is 115 proof. Then there‚Äôs the full proof/cask strength/barrel proofs. These have the most flavor but also most alcohol burn. Wild Turkey Rare Breed, Elijah Craig BP, Larceny BP (Wheated), Jack Daniel‚Äôs Single Barrel BP, Weller FP (Wheated), Still Austin Cask Strength. 

Next one I recommend most for beginners is Irish. They are usually very approachable as well and usually not as expensive as scotch. Jameson is a good entry level (it was what got me into whiskey), Jameson Black barrel is a step up from regular Jameson, Tulamore Dew, green spot, powers John Lanes Edition, Bushmills, Teeling, and then Redbreast 12. Then there‚Äôs redbreast caskstrength. Redbreast is one of my all time favorites. 

Rye is usually American as well but not always. Beginners usually don‚Äôt like rye as much cause it‚Äôs more spicy (black peppery). Many people love it though so worth trying. I found out I like rye by trying bulliet bourbon and rye side by side. Rye won by a large margin. Michter‚Äôs Single barrel rye is my favorite rye. There‚Äôs also still Austin, sagamore, wild Turkey (101 and rare breed) then Jack Daniel‚Äôs Single Barrel Barre Proof (its is very very close to Michter‚Äôs for me). 

Scotch has 5 regions and each region is like its own category. There is also a kinda subregion some people call a separate region called the islands. Most of them are truly in highlands region except for Islay which is its own region. 

Speyside: is probably the most well known. It‚Äôs got Glenlivet, Glenfiddich and Macallan. These are what you‚Äôll usually find at most bars that actually have scotch. 

Highlands: a huge region with many great options. Highland park, Glenfarclas, glenmorangie, the dalmore are some popular ones. 

Lowlands: I haven‚Äôt tried many so no good recommendations from me on this. 
 
Campbell Town: smallest region. I haven‚Äôt ever found a bottle in a store near me from here. I‚Äôve heard it has a ‚Äúfunk‚Äù to it. 

Islay (eye-lah): this is the region that you either love or hate. Very few people are ok with it. These are the peat/smoke bombs. Even if you end up hating them you should try at least one. The big 3 are going to be Lagavulin (my personally favorite whisky), ardbeg and laphroiag. There are many other islays but those are the most popular. Ardbeg has quite a few finished in different casks.
I'd agree with that.
I‚Äôve always thought Irish whiskey was the ‚Äòeasiest‚Äô to drink, especially for someone new to whiskey.  Green Spot and Red Breast are both fantastic.   Tullamore is a bit cheaper than them, and still very good.
Pendleton
Jack Daniels single barrel, michters small batch, and woodford reserve double Oaked are on the sweeter side like Buffalo Trace
Four roses is one I've seen all over and not tried yet.¬† That ones worth the price?
2nd on the Knob Creek 9 and Russell's 10, well really all of these
One of my favorites, very sweet in comparison to the others. But oh those flavors!!!
1792 full proof is a different conversation though‚Ä¶ evan williams white label bottled in bond is my go to cheap one
Just curious... So I've had Irish and scotch whiskey. I prefer bourbon, I thought the scotch and Irish whiskeys I've drank were very similar. I like them but I don't go out of my way to drink them I prefer bourbon or rye. I've never tried Japanese whiskey. I heard it is very much like scotch and the only real difference is the branding, culture, and processes but similar mash bills. Is this true?  I've been curious to try some Japanese whiskey but don't wanna spend the money  if it's basically just Japanese scotch lol. Maybe I'm being closed minded because the only Irish whiskey I've had is Jameson, tulamore dew, and Johnny Walker black label lol to me they just qualified as mixers nothing I'd drink neat.
single barrel and small batch select are my faves but you really can‚Äôt go wrong
Never tried small batch but Four Roses Single Barrel was the first real bourbon bottle I ever bought and I absolutely love the stuff.
> I've never tried Japanese whiskey. I heard it is very much like scotch and the only real difference is the branding, culture, and processes but similar mash bills. Is this true?  I've been curious to try some Japanese whiskey but don't wanna spend the money  if it's basically just Japanese scotch lol. Maybe

If you prefer Bourbon out of those, Japanese probably won't change your mind, as it's far more similar to Scotch than it is to bourbon. 

To be fair, yeah, the ones you tried aren't exactly top shelf whiskies in any context, but I wouldn't call them terrible either. If you get a chance to try the 2 Irish whiskies I've listed, I'm pretty sure you'd find them enjoyable.

If you want something way different, try Islay scotches like Ardbeg, Lagavulin & Laphroaig."
Review: Royal Salute 21,"This whisky, despite its age, surprises with a lively and fresh aroma, predominantly fruity with notes of dark fruits, grapes, and ripe juicy peach. The oak adds a dry touch up close. The taste is sweet, reminiscent of high cocoa chocolate with fruit mousse, accompanied by a hint of cinnamon. Incredibly smooth and well-rounded, the blending is complex and beautiful. The finish, surprisingly long for its 40% alcohol content, features dry oakiness, faint cafe au lait, and baked apple‚Äîa stunning combination. Despite being a single malt enthusiast, the lack of bitterness and absence of smoke make this Chivas whisky exceptionally well-crafted, leaving a desire for a higher ABV version.",
Review #2: Traveller Whiskey,"Traveller whiskey is a blended whiskey likely made with bourbon and sourced Canadian whiskey. It is unknown what proportions are used in the blend, or if other whiskey types are used. It contains 0% grain-neutral spirits like vodka or everclear which is apparently a selling point for a $40 bottle from Buffalo Trace now. It is ""crafted"" with the ""help"" of Chris Stapleton which makes no sense because he is reportedly sober. I don't know what he did to help with this other than standing around for some pictures. I will admit, I am a big country music fan and I enjoy Stapleton's music but this collaboration is almost satirical level pandering. The bottle is pretty cool though and looks clean and classy with a satisfying minimalist/retro style. Buffalo Trace (or Sazerac) has mastered the art of marketing and could sell ice to an eskimo. After reading several mixed/negative reviews, I decided not to actively seek this one out. Yesterday, I was shopping at a local liquor store and they happened to have several cases of this for $40 each. I decided it was worth a shot. Here are my thoughts:

Nose: cherries, leather, hint of vanilla on a backdrop of ethanol. Pretty faint nose but honestly more enjoyable than I expected. I am now feeling pretty hopeful about what this will taste like.

Palate: Damn. Disappointment. Slight sweetness upfront, slight citrus, rye spice, ethanol. I feel like I have to focus to find any discernible flavors. Reminds me of Basil Hayden: nothing offensive but nothing noteworthy either. Just a whole lot of nothing.

Finish: Really short. Getting some rye spice and cinnamon on the back end with scant residual sweetness and some more ethanol.

Overall: 4.5/10

This is not a bad whiskey. It is a very boring whiskey. This might be an unfair assessment since this is not a bourbon, nor does it claim to have big, bold flavors. BT actually markets it as ""easy to drink, hard not to love"". I would say they succeeded in the first half of that statement. It is very easy to drink and honestly I might recommend it for someone trying to get into whiskey. However, this is my review and I am telling you how much I enjoyed it so 4.5/10.","It sounds like it‚Äôs done exactly what it wanted to. It‚Äôs not aimed at whiskey drinkers. It‚Äôs aimed at Stapleton fans who heard the song. So smooth and unchallenging.
No way I would spend money on this.  Starter whiskey for a novice maybe but if you know anything about whiskey you don‚Äôt support this garbage unless you want companies to come out with more like this.
Love the review and agree!! This is HOT GARBAGE for any bourbon lover. I was excited on the nose and once it was in my palate I was like WTF!! Good thing my gurl doesn't like bourbon. Made her a Ky Mule out of this and she loves it!! $40 Saved, hahaha
This whiskey is targeting ‚Äútaters‚Äù.  Shame on you, Buffalo Trace.
Someone needs to compare this to basil hayden. Battle of the ultimate boring whiskey
Sweet glove
[I managed to select this bottle which appears to be hand signed by Chris Stapleton](https://i.redd.it/v5ovyyaas2gc1.jpeg?app_web_view=ios)
Bingo. After a few sips of this, it‚Äôll have them thinking they‚Äôre a neat sipping, whiskey aficionado. Then one whiff of anything barrel proof will have them crying ghost pepper tears"
Whiskey that tastes similar to Knob Creek 12yr but cheaper and other question.,"Essentially the title.  I got a bottle of Knob 12yr as a gift and have finished it finally.  I enjoyed it, but I dont drink whiskey enough to spot the $60 odd dollars for it.

Was wondering if there was something with similar tasting notes for cheaper or if im just SOL and should buy it again.

Also, I enjoy woodford reserve, but was looking for something different to try that you guys would think would be as enjoyable.","Just get the Knob 9 yr . Half as much. Snickers in a glass.
I mean, that KC12 is a sweet spot for age-value. KC 9 is solid but the 12 takes it to another level.
Knob Creek 12 is already a great value. At some point you have to pay up if you want something quality.
If you don't drink it that much, the $60 bottle should last you quite a while.  I'd say buy what you like.
Bakers 7 is made by Beam and only single barrels. It is cheaper but some duds in there. However most are phenomal
Might be helpful to know what you have/haven't tried and if you're interested in branching out into other options, or if you only want to drink something that tastes like Knob Creek. For example, have you tried ryes?
Can‚Äôt touch KC 12 here in Texas and if you can it‚Äôs for $89.
$60 for banger 12 year is really hard to beat. There‚Äôs very good bourbon for cheaper but it won‚Äôt have the age on it, so if that‚Äôs specifically what you‚Äôre looking for I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll find it. The KC 9 is really good, not super similar to the 12, but it‚Äôs a go-to for me so I still recommend it. If you really enjoy the 12 and don‚Äôt drink much, that bottle should last for a long time and could be worth the $60, even though that‚Äôs not the advice you asked for.

You should check out one of the countless ‚Äúnew drinker bourbon list‚Äù type posts on here and try out some of those more inexpensive recommendations. You won‚Äôt find anything around 12 years if you don‚Äôt want to pay for it, but you‚Äôll find some other really nice stuff for less money. WT101 (bourbon, not rye) is a very frequently recommended bottle for around $20-25. One of my all time favorites and the price just makes it that much better. If you don‚Äôt like the proof you can add a splash of water. Evan Williams 1783 is another great bottle for less than $20 and I think that‚Äôs only 90 proof, love that stuff.
Tough to find a 12 year bourbon for that price, KC12 is delicious and fairly priced IMO.
$60 for a 12 year old bourbon is a fucking amazing value. Especially considering how much you already like it.
Have you tried the woodford double oaked? I seem to be able to find it for $40 now and its dessert in a glass
I actually prefer the 9 year to the 12 year. The 15 and 18 are very good, but at a price. I‚Äôm happy with the 9.
I got the 12 year as a gift, haven‚Äôt tried buying it myself because I bought the 9 and it really wasn‚Äôt my thing. Ended up taking the 9 to a family get-together and they helped me finish it off. The 12, on the other hand, seems completely different to me and is freaking delicious. I get how it makes perfect sense to suggest the 9 as ‚Äú12, but cheaper‚Äù, but I also totally get the OP if they were looking for other recommendations that would better capture the taste of the 12.
Baker's is 70-80 where I live, KC12 usually 60ish
You‚Äôre probably right.

I‚Äôve had Woodford Reserve, Knob 12yr, Woodford Reserve Rye, and Makers Mark.

I didnt really care for the WR Rye, makers mark was kind of flat, not very flavorful.

I liked the flavor of Knob 12, but not necessarily the proof, it came off a bit harsh.
$40?!   you buying the 375ml ?   

I haven‚Äôt seen WDO that cheap since ‚ÄòNam.
I should probably try WR Rye just to see what it tastes like. My favorite budget ryes are Wild Turkey 101 and Old Overholt 114. They're both really fantastic offerings (although I think the 114 might be harder to find). Very sweet and spicy.

I also find MM to be kind of flat tasting, which suggests both you and I don't like wheat-based whiskeys (which are specifically made to be softer and milder).

I'd try the Rye 101, it's like $25-30 everywhere and worth trying to see if you like it. If you don't like it straight it makes an excellent mixer because of its proof.

I honestly am not much of a bourbon drinker at all so good luck on finding an affordable Knob Creek 12 alternative.
Costco in CA has it everyday for that much and some supermarkets. Guess it‚Äôs not like that elsewhere
Just picked up a bottle of Woodford double oak today for $43 at a Total Wine in MN.

Elijah Craig Barrel Proof C923 vs B923,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ck7q15hwjfdc1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41105ad9054dd093ca73abff4c5aee4012bfa079

opened the B523 and blind tested it against the infamous C923, mostly with the goal to check how big the difference really is between the two. Disclaimer: I am not that deep into the whiskey journey and trying to keep it that way for my own good, so consider this a beginners ""review"".

I did detect the C923 right away just based on its intensity, but that doesn't mean the B523 is less good IMO.

Nose: preferred the B by a tiny margin. The C is a little harsh and it took me a few more attempts to get past the ethanol and enjoy the notes. The B was a little softer and sweeter.

Palate and finish: Enjoyed both a lot, but the C is def more intense and has more going on. I am overall getting a similar flavor profile that is quite oaky, a bit spicy and not very sweet (especially compared to some of the wheaters and finished bourbons I have). I can't detect the notes down to the ""cherry"" level, so I won't pretend, but I could tell the age on both. The B is a little lighter and sweeter, the C is more of a blast of intensity and flavors. The difference is there, but its not that big.

In summary, the C923 is the ""winner"" for me and I totally get why its regarded so highly, but its certainly not a beginner's bourbon! This is for experienced Bourbon lovers that seek a very intense experience. To everyone else I would highly recommend not to get sucked into the hype, ignore the batch number and just try any ECBP you see if you want a high proof, higher aged quality bourbon at a decent price.

Going forward I won't get too worked up about the different batches. If I run low, I'll even buy the A124 with its ""measly"" 10yr age statement :-P   I trust that they do a decent job with their batches and that it will be tasty. 

Cheers!

Edit: yes, there is a typo in the title, C923 vs B523.",
(My) New review method,"So one of the things I‚Äôve been struggling with is how to review whiskey. I‚Äôve felt it was tough on a 1-100 scale for several reasons:

1. How is one whiskey a 93 vs a 92?
2. It‚Äôs hard not to equate it to a school grade rating scale where 59% of the spectrum is an F
3. 100 points is a lot of points

But, I want to do it out of 100 because I like a broader spectrum than a 1-10 scale and I use ABOV as my tracking app and it is a 1-100 scale. Previously my scale was really based on how likely I would be to purchase it and at what price. I felt like it was flawed in that there were $40 whiskeys that I liked as much as a $150 whiskey but rated it lower because I knew I wouldn‚Äôt overpay for it. Below is what I came up with. Basically a whiskey starts at 94pts and loses points based on being too something and the max points it can lose are based on how much it matters to me.

Nose (12)
   Ethanol -2/4/6
   Don‚Äôt like -2/4/6

Taste (60)
   Body -2/4/6
   Sweetness -2/4/6
   Ethanol -5/10/15
   Spice -2/4/6/8
   Peat -5/10/15
   ABV -2/4
   Balance -2/4/6

Finish (22)
Taste (20)
   Ethanol -2/4/6
   Peat -2/4/6
   Sweet -2/4
   Spice -2/4
Length (2)
   Short -2

Value (6)
Value +0/2/4/6

Ex: Something like Buffalo Trace will lose 2 pts for the ethanol on the nose, and 5 for the ethanol on the tongue. It loses very little in other places because it is pretty well balanced. Something like Hudson Baby will lose 6 on the nose, 15 for ethanol on the tongue, and many other points because the ethanol masks everything else.

I did ethanol and ABV separate because there are some 60% ABV whiskeys that are really smooth and there are some 40% ABV whiskeys that are really harsh. Also, with a 60% if you want to water it down, you can, which makes the bottle last longer but you can‚Äôt make a 40% stronger.

Once I get it going, the value will be based on bottle cost/ points and will be added after the original 94 points so I can still do blind tastings. Ex:A $200 bottle that has 94 points so far might only bump up to 96 points and a $40 bottle that has 92 points could jump to 98 overall. I originally wasn‚Äôt going to do this because I felt like the rating should just be on how it smells/tastes but, price matters to me.

I am open to any suggestions before I finalize this but please remember that they should be general suggestions (like adding a section for availability) and not personal suggestions (like I put too much emphasis on peat). Cheers to you for reading it this long.","I like it! Very thoughtful. I do agree that availability should count as part of the score. Some whiskeys are great not only because they are delicious, but because they are also widely available.
Yes availability and price point do impact the overall value of the product outside of the physical properties that make up the product. Then you can start to compare apples to apples.
I thought about it actually. I might."
Would you?,,"No, it‚Äôs watered down Blanton‚Äôs in a smaller bottle for 4x the price..
Absolutely not.
$230 for 80 proof anything is silly goose territory!
Pay that to drink it? Never. You‚Äôre paying for the fact it‚Äôs an export bottle, so people can‚Äôt get it here. Then you‚Äôre paying for the Blanton‚Äôs name. On top of that you‚Äôre competing with collectors looking for the right dump date or horse topper.

I‚Äôm probably never buying a bottle of black or green because the most I‚Äôd be comfortable paying is like $40ish so I‚Äôll be just as disappointed as if someone poured me a glass of Basil Hayden. I‚Äôll never see it for $40. So easy pass.
No.
If that‚Äôs the best deal you can find, go for it. My wife got me a bottle and I enjoyed it. Very floral. Sweet cherry notes. Smooth.
No chance. Wouldn't spend more than $150 on a bottle except for a terribly special occasion and would pick something else in that case.
I don‚Äôt pay for under proofed stuff let alone overpay for it. For 80 proof I wouldn‚Äôt touch even at srp.
To my knowledge, ppl in Japan can readily buy this on Amazon there and it doesn‚Äôt cost close to this
It‚Äôs actually quite tasty!!  It is lower proof, but it‚Äôs aged a little longer and it‚Äôs almost floral. I really like it, but not at that price.  That said, if you have some extra $$ to burn (for all we know, you are Jeff Bezos‚Äô kid üòéü§™üëç) go get it!  But there are definitely better bourbons available for less (imho)
Nope. I have zero interest in the horsey bottles. Never had one and will never buy one.
Hell yeah!
Looks fake
No chance
No
lol

no
Hahaha
No
THIS - as far as I can tell is 100% accurate - because I bought one!

It's a pretty bottle and a cool one for the bar but I don't recommend it.
Still says 750ml‚Ä¶.

Edit: I meant the actual box, geniuses. Not the ad. Look closer.
Absolutely not
You said dump date‚Ä¶
No, it says 700ml.
The ad does, the box behind it says 750ml.
Yeah but that's just a stock image for product advertisement and display, the title is more likely to be accurate. I do see your point though.
From what I see on their website, Blanton‚Äôs (regardless of version) is made in three sizes: 50ml, 375ml, and 750ml. I think all other things being equal, I‚Äôd be more inclined to lean towards whoever did the data entry for the ad simply keyed it in wrong.
US is 750, international is 700. This release is international so bottle would be 700. For instance Gold was historically only international so was always 700. Now it's both so you can find export 700ml bottles and domestic 750ml bottles
Same bottle, different ad - 750ml

https://openqs.com/product/blantons-black-label-japanese-release-bourbon-750-ml/
Second ad - 750

https://www.passionspirits.com/blantons-black-label-japanese-bourbon.html
See, now I‚Äôm really confused. If it‚Äôs an international (700 ml) release, then why does the damn box (which goes with the bottle) say $750?
They probably just used available stock images of it which happened to be the US 750ml
Or you‚Äôre just wrong and that Blanton‚Äôs only comes in 750ml bottles."
Gift for a friend!!,"Hello, this is probably a shot in the dark but I really want to get my friend a nice bottle for his birthday. He's also a roommate and he just helps out with so much. 

I'm a TOTAL amateur when it comes to whiskey.
He LOVED this whiskey we bought in Tennessee, **CORSAIR HYDRA**. He was able to find a bottle a few years ago and has been out of luck since. It seems that they quit making it. Soooo I'm hoping someone may know of a similar whiskey that I could get him. 


Description
American Whiskey | 42% ABV

Producer: Corsair Distillery

Commercial Description:

A blend of five smoked malts (pecan, apple, sugar maple, black walnut, and persimmon woods) this is undoubtedly a smoky whiskey, but with a flavor that is complex and well-balanced.

TASTING NOTES

The experience of tasting this whiskey evolves over the palate, allowing the flavor of each of the hardwood smoked malts to arise to the fore and then recede, letting the next hardwood emerge to the front. Notes of leather and roasted pecans gently give way to spiced apples and persimmons, followed by black walnut‚Äôs distinct warmth and sugar maple‚Äôs blush of sweetness. The finish is distinctly woodsy and clean.


Any help is appreciated, thank you so so much!!","Corsair has some interesting stuff that I imagine a lot of whiskey drinkers don‚Äôt respect a lot but I‚Äôve liked some of their offerings and enjoyed the tasting we did when we were in Nashville once.  I don‚Äôt really know what to compare it to though, but if you want general recs I‚Äôm sure you will get a bunch."
MWND Act 11‚Ä¶Pickle Note?,"Folks, am I losing my mind? Probably. But is my taste in whiskey a symptom/indicator of that?

I recently acquired Midwinter Night‚Äôs Dram Act 11 (Scene 10). Immediately upon removing the cork and nosing it (from the bottle) for the first time, I chuckled to myself a little in disbelief as the first note I perceived was‚Ä¶pickles. 

My first pour (that same day) and my second/most recent pour (days later -> today) I found the same note. Like, the most prominent note across both the nose and palate. 

Now I‚Äôm a scotch man mainly. In recent years I‚Äôve been expanding my knowledge and collection of bourbon. Ryes constitute a very small corner of my collection and are my least favourite category. My preferences and lack of experience in the rye area may account for a good share of this pickley phenomenon. 

But all of it? Am I completely wrong, or do you kinda know what I‚Äôm talking about? For folks with greater rye knowledge, what‚Äôs going on here?

My best guess is it‚Äôs something to do with rye spices mixing with sweetness from the port finish somehow combining to form the pickle note, but at this point I‚Äôm just scratching my head and guessing. 

So. Pickly or not pickly. Why or why not. Help me out. Please.","MGP rye is known for its dill notes (not all the time, but often enough).  High West uses a decent amount of MGP rye these days, so it makes sense.
You're not crazy, it definitely has a fresh dill note.
Ryes can have a mint or dill note to them depending. Very normal and probably more prominent since you mainly drink scotch - so it's very evident on your palate.
Had no idea, super useful context. Thank you. I mean I knew MGP was used in High West, but not that they‚Äôre known for dill notes! Thanks again
Thank you!!! This is relieving to hear lol
Its not an omnipresent note in every MGP rye but it's very common.

Some brands who use MGP, such as Belle Of Bedford, seem to specifically target bottles with strong dill notes.

It's kind of funny because MGP considers it a defect but lots of people enjoy it.
Very interesting indeed. Thank you very much. I don‚Äôt personally love it unfortunately but I‚Äôm hoping to get past it.
Its a love/hate thing for a lot of people, similar to the mineral notes that can show up in George Dickel whiskey.  I can definitely see how it could clash with a port finish though.  Dill and port don't seem to mix.

High West originally didn't use MGP for Rendezvous Rye (the base for MWND), it used to be 16 year Barton rye but then they gradually ran out and had to start using MGP rye and their own rye in the blend.  So when you hear people talk about how older batches of MWND were way better, it's not just nostalgia talking.

Also oddly I was primarily a scotch guy for years and I find myself generally enjoying rye more than bourbon.  It's generally more complex.
Loving this education on High West and MGP, thanks. I‚Äôd love to love rye more than I do, maybe one day. Especially if I keep broadening my collection. For now it‚Äôs scotch>>>>>bourbon>>>>>>rye for me personally.
Try Sagamore Double Oaked Rye if you want to have a different kind of rye.  More maple syrup pancakes with brown sugar to me.  None of those silly dilly notes or eucalyptus or pine needles I find in other ryes."
Westland Outpost Garryana 8,"I recently had a cool opportunity to visit Westland because they recently bought my first lot of malt from my new malting company, and this was happening right when their new Garryana release was named 3rd best whiskey in the WORLD by Whiskey advocate.  They had expected the 7000 bottles to last around 7 months, but they sold out in 2 weeks after the article came out. When I was at the distillery, they had to pause all whiskey production so they could be all hands on for shipping out orders, it was nuts.  Folks were lined up outside, as well.

The whiskey is great.  I don't have one of those palates that can pick out super nuanced notes, so I'll spare you that part.  I am usually left feeling a bit let down when I get really hyped, high dollar spirits but I can emphatically say this one did not disappoint.  Those that I've shared it with also loved it.  There's no burn, it's extremely smooth and very sweet.  It's not over oaked, despite the virgin garryana barrels being very potent.  The one strange thing about it is that the sweetness sticks around for so long on your tongue.  I can see why they say, ""Krispy Kreme donut"" because that fatty sweetness coats your tongue.  My buddy and I laughed because we could still taste the sweetness a couple minutes later.","Just got a Batch 5, curious to try it out as well, cheers thanks for your thoughts

Whisk(e)y has a wide plethora tasting note vocabulary. How can I expand my tasting note vocabulary,"Hey everyone, I just enrolled in a Council of Whisky Masters, Whisky Certified course. I‚Äôm learning a whole lot, but what I‚Äôm not learning from the course is tasting notes vocabulary. I just bought an Irish whiskey, just the classic ‚Äúthe original‚Äù $30 bottle of bushmills. & it‚Äôs nothing like scotch whisky, there‚Äôs no peat, no smoke, it‚Äôs very light.

     I googled the tasting notes & ‚Äúall forms of Blossom‚Äù is one of the tasting notes on 

https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/bushmills/bushmills-original-whiskey/

My question is, how do I expand my tasting notes & pallate vocabulary. Do I have to go out, find & eat blossoms?? Do I have to go out & buy & eat vanilla?
     How do I expand my tasting note & ‚Äúon the nose‚Äù notes vocab?

I‚Äôm very scared lol any advice is seriously appreciated my fellow connoisseurs. Cheers","Tasting notes are really just analogies based on aromas and flavors which the author has previously experienced. And many of the notes commonly used to describe whiskies are aromas - I don't think that many people have *tasted* the ""burning bandaids"" conventionally used to describe the heavily peated scotch Laphroaig - but many people know the medicinal smell of iodine used in antispectic washes, and can imagine that smell combined with the burning smoke smell of something on fire.

So, it is a combination of experience & imagination, mostly focused on aromas. 

A good writer of tasting notes tries to find ways to make these specific enough to hold the reader's interest (if every whisky was described as tasting like ""caramel & vanilla"" that would get a bit boring) and make it easier for them to imagine what is distinctive about the particular whisky being described, but without leaning too heavily on notes that are so uniquely personal that nobody but the writer can imagine that sensory experience.

It is a learned skill which takes practice, both writing and reading tasting notes:

https://recenteats.blogspot.com/2016/10/tasting-notes-through-years.html

As with other things that take practice, the best way to get good at it is to just do it a lot, over and over. One thing which helps is to start paying more attention to the flavors and smells which you encounter in daily life - focusing more attention and thought than you might normally do on their finer details and what distinguishes them from one another. How does the flavor of a peach differ from the flavor of an apricot? Pink lady apples and granny smith apples do not taste exactly the same, but how and in what way do they differ? The smoke from a campfire and the exhaust from a diesel engine do not smell the same, but what distinguishes them? Etc.

Then, read a lot of whisky reviews by writers who pitch their tasting notes at a level of detail that works for you. There is a wide variety of such, from very concise (see Ian Buxton's little book *101 Whiskies To Try Before You Die*) to very prolix - like the descriptions by Serge and Angus at www.whiskyfun.com which at times head into the territory of Proustian prose poetry. I personally find appealing a middle ground between those two extremes, such as the tasting notes in David Broom's book *The World Atlas of Whisky* (which I very strongly rec as a first whisky book) or in online reviews posted by Ruben at www.whiskynotes.be and Thijs at www.wordsofwhisky.com

You can also find a very wide range of styles in tasting notes at the www.whiskybase.com by looking up specific whiskies on that site. And by searching for reviews here on Reddit.

Try as much as possible to read reviews of whiskies that you are personally familiar with or have easy access to - that will help you develop a sense of how flavors are conventionally described by others and start to build a vocabulary of your own by borrowing from how other people talk about whiskies (don't be afraid to dissent from conventional wisdom however, if it tastes different to you).

Some other resources for thinking about flavors in whiskies in a more technical manner (as well as all sorts of info regarding their production) can be found at this site:

Good luck
This won‚Äôt be the first time I say this and for certain won‚Äôt be the last‚Ä¶ Eat more food. Eat everything. Smell everything. Find foods that confuse you, and then eat them. Expand the palate. 

You can get ‚Äòaromatic experience kits‚Äô which are either essential oils on cotton balls or dried spices/herbs/foods to nose. These help guide a bit, but it‚Äôs still feels stale by comparison to a natural, fresh smell. 

Not everyone knows what it‚Äôs like to walk through orchards in April when the blossoms are going off, but now you should probably do it. I personally love going to my local botanic gardens in the winter as that‚Äôs when the citrus are going. I love orange and lemon blossom. 

Does everyone have a great palate? No. But practicing and exercising your palate will help event the dullest.  

I love that you‚Äôre interested in finding the deeper flavors in your whiskey!
Use your own tasting, smelling experiences and don't try to force others you have no experience with. Once thing I detest are nosing and tasting notes which sound forced and way too specific.  If it smells like caramel apple, say it, don't say ""Washington caramel Fuji Apple Skin cinnamon fruit roll up"".
Can‚Äôt believe I read all of that lol
Great advice! Love the ‚ÄòHow they differ‚Äô advice! I will be checking the links out!! This is greatly appreciated !! Thank you, thank you!
Not just this but *pay attention* to what you're eating. The sensory experience *has* to be intentional. Don't get some food you never had and eat it while watching TV. Basically pretend you want to do tasting notes (and honestly, this isn't a bad idea to take literally sometimes) on everything you eat, drink, and smell.

Expanding your whiskey note vocabulary is the same as expanding your note vocabulary on its own. Nothing truly special about whiskey that makes it different. The people who are able to give useful notes on a whiskey can generally do so with any food or drink."
A good Oak forward whiskey?,"Hey guys! I m still fairly new to developing my palate when it comes to whiskey. I tend to like scotch more than bourbon. However, The one thing i really like in bourbon is the oak smell/taste. My dad growing up was a woodworker and the smell of oak is engrained in my mind and very nostalgic. I love when I get some whiskey and can smell/taste the oak flavor. Reminds me of helping my dad out in the shop.  I find im no a huge fan of sweeter whiskey. I don't care much for the fruit/bannanaesque tastes.  I seem to like rye and scotch the most. But is there a good whiskey that has a really strong oak notes to them? thanks!","Woodford Reserve Double Oaked
Go for the older age stated bourbons.
Woodford Reserve Double Oaked is probably the best option I know of that is moderately priced.
Knob Creek 12 or 18, Elijah Craig 18 are probably 3 of the more oak forward pours you will find.
To everyone saying ‚Äúget a double oaked‚Äù bottle‚Ä¶OP wants an oak flavor, not the sweetness/vanilla/dessert flavor (take your pick or add a flavor), that comes with double barreling. OP wants that dry, oak-ey flavor that you get (typically?) with age.
WF Double Oaked, Elijah Craig 18, Elijah Craig BP (some expressions), Knob Creek 18, Old Forester 1910.
Looks like I need to get a double oaked! I bought a bottle of woodford the other day and almost got the double oaked but but changed my mind at the last second. Next bottle will have to be one. Thanks guys!
As a woodworker, I think what you‚Äôre going for would be along the lines of Baker‚Äôs, Booker‚Äôs, Michter‚Äôs, Maker‚Äôs 46, Barrell, anything ‚Äúdouble oaked‚Äù.
As already suggested Makers 46 or Woodford Double Oaked would do the trick, I‚Äôll throw in Dancing Goat Limousin Rye as another one, MGP rye finished with French oak, very tasty.
Try Calumet 16 year
Nice oaky afterbirth
Actually now that I think about it, if you like peat, try Balcones Peated Single Malt for the best of both worlds.
If you are up for the higher proof of it (which is more common in bourbon than in scotch) then Elijah Craig Barrel Proof has to my taste some of the most strongly expressed oak tannin notes, while still being a high quality pour.

Other older bourbons also show similar notes, but are often either harder to find or more expensive (than ECBP) in today's market.
Garrison brothers. Pretty much any of them are very oaky.
Old Forester 1910 is my favorite double oaked.
Knob Creek 18 and Baker's 13
Elijah Craig has a nice oakiness to it for the price point.
Strong oak notes I‚Äôve had : Knob creek 12 year, Knob Creek 18 year (allocated), any of the old Fitzgerald (highly allocated), Bookers (kinda allocated, location dependent), 2XO, Russel‚Äôs Private Single barrels +9 year old (store picks)
If you tend to like scotch more, you could try Laphroaig Quarter Cask. The quarter cask finish adds a much stronger oak note than you generally find in most scotch.

It is a peated scotch though, so be warned if you're not a fan of peat.
Auchentoshan american oak is a smoot single malt scotch with oak notes.   Highly recommended.

Edit: spelling
Russell‚Äôs reserve 13
‚Ä¢Coopers Craft 100 proof (~$35)

‚Ä¢Henry McKenna 10yr BIB (~$70)

I‚Äôm in Nashville, so those are my local prices give or take
Calumet 16 is on the pricier side but should be pretty findable and is definitely very oak forward
Sagamore Double Oaked smells exactly like cutting firewood
This is the way.
Knob 18 for suuuuurrrreeeee. Oak bomb
Woodford is a solid double oaked, but if Peerless double oaked is another level. It‚Äôs incredible.
It‚Äôs a great bottle
OP, a ‚Äúdouble oaked‚Äù may not give you the flavor you are looking for. Read through the comments; Woodford Double Oaked (although great) may not have the profile you are looking for.
Haven‚Äôt tried it. Seems to be a favorite though
I love laphroigh an ardbeg. But only had the 10 years. Although highland park is my favorite. I‚Äôll have to look into this thanks!
I got a baby on the way. Wife my kill me if I bring home a 160$ bottle lol
I was reading about the sagamore double oaked rye. Seems like it would be a great choice. Do you like it?
I read it had some pretty sweet notes too it?
I tend to be opposite of you and like mine a little sweeter. This bottle everyone says is that but it‚Äôs not what I get and is a complete wood chip oak bomb and could be up your alley. 

Sagamore produces some great stuff and I love their Sherry and Cask Strength versions but I get way more sweetness out of the Woodford Double Oaked for what it‚Äôs worth."
Regular Ol‚Äô Whiskey Review: Larceny BP Batch: C923 and Willett 4 Year Rye,"Review time, go:

Let‚Äôs start with the Larceny BP. The best way I can describe this is that it is a good bourbon. I don‚Äôt do traditional tasting notes, but you can expect the same flavor you would expect in a bourbon. The flavor is medium strong, but nothing super ‚Äúspecial‚Äù or unique. It is, quite simply, a damn fine bourbon. What makes it special to me is the flavor when compared to the proof: Despite being 63.2% it is easy to drink, and easy to forget how much you‚Äôre really drinking. I found myself breaking it out when I wanted to be drunk quickly and wanted to enjoy the process. It is great in an old fashioned. A whiskey sour masks the taste more than it would a smokier bourbon, but it doesn‚Äôt disappear. My wife found it for Christmas for me, at about $70. If price isn‚Äôt an obstacle, it‚Äôs an 8/10, which to me means a liquor to keep in the cabinet at all times. If price is an obstacle, 7/10, which in *this* case means it is worth getting but only for a special occasion.


Now, the Willett 4 Year Rye. This is a very complex rye. Again, I don‚Äôt do traditional tasting notes. You can expect the spiciness that come with a rye, but with a *darker* quality to it which reminds me of a Bavarian Dunkel in comparison to a traditional lager or wheat beer. There is a lot going on in the palette, and as a result it deserves to be treated with respect. It is not as approachable as a Michter‚Äôs Rye, and in an old fashioned it brings a *lot* of flavor. I got it on sale for $60, which from what I can find it about MSRP. At that price point it is a 9/10, something to bring out when you‚Äôre feeling its unique flavor will do well or when you have whiskey-savvy guests over. I‚Äôve also seen it for around $80, which would knock it to an 8.5/10, which in this case means it is something nice to get when you want to celebrate and treat yourself but could easily be beaten out by other sales of good whiskey or options available to you.

Cheers!",

##Age:
3 years at the youngest (fighting cock)

##Proof:
106 (I mathed it)

##Mash Bill:
Yes

##Nose: 
Honestly my mind is blown with how good this smells. I am getting a ton of cocktail cherries right away, along with some butterscotch. Vanilla like a Nilla wafer or blonde Oreo. There is some oak coming through as well. Overall a very sweet nose with some hints of oak. 

##Taste:
Surprisingly spicy off the jump. Getting a lot of rye notes, which makes sense from some of the high rye mash-bills at a high proof. Some fruity grape flavors that I attribute to Eagle Rare. Also, some young whiskey harshness is definitely in this glass. The taste is definitely worse than the nose, but it‚Äôs still good. 

##Texture:
Texture is great for a 106 proofer. Oily and smooth. 

##Finish:
The finish is much better than I expected after the initial taste. Peppery and spicy, with some cinnamon. Long lasting. A little bit metallic which is off-putting. 

##My final thoughts:
It‚Äôs actually way better than I expected it to be. Is the combined product better than every bottle on the shelf? No. Is the combined product better than half the bottles on the shelf? Fuck yeah. It‚Äôs just fun to have though. A unique experience that you only have yourself because it cannot be replicated. If you are into whiskey I don‚Äôt see any reason not to try this. 

My last thing to say is that if you make infinity bottles by dumping the remains of a glass you didn‚Äôt finish into it, you‚Äôre fucking disgusting. 

#Final Score: 6.8/10","Glad you like your Infinity bottle. Mine didn't turn out well and I don't have the heart to pour it out lol. Also, I regret doing that C923 laser code review comparison. Probably something I should've kept to myself. I think some people made too much of that. And my review apparently didn't help.
Sick idea for a review, nice work.

I've been getting deep into home blending recently, it's a fun sub-hobby. I've spent months perfecting a blend designed and named after one of the perspective characters in the book I'm writing. Just sent test case #2 off to a bunch of whiskey dork friends and it has been receiving glowing feedback. One of my best friends is a phenomenal artist and she is in the process of designing artwork/bottle label for it. The eventual goal is to have a 5 bottle series, one for each of the perspective characters, and for each blend to be an expression of the character's personality, story, and characteristics.

I'm stoked about it, and often surprised that I don't see more folks doing blending projects.
This sounds both intriguing and beyond my current skill. I can dump stuff from multiple bottles into a single bottle, but I don‚Äôt yet know enough about what I like, why I like it, and what flavors will elevate it versus drive it off a cliff. Hats off to you, though. Sounds like you‚Äôve created a cool statement piece and conversation starter.
I tried this on a whim and I can honestly say it‚Äôs the best bourbon I‚Äôve ever had because I‚Äôve ‚Äútuned‚Äù it to my exact liking. I should‚Äôve done it a long time ago because all this craziness with people hoarding bourbon has made finding good bourbon a chore and it‚Äôs not fun anymore for me. Now I just tune my infinity bottle to my liking at the time and I love it. Neat, on the rocks, splash of Coke, or ginger ale, whatever I want and it‚Äôs always delicious.
‚ÄúMash Bill: yes‚Äù got me pretty good, cheers ü•É
I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised. I thought things like jim beam double oak and fighting cock were really going to bring down the bottle. Also clashing flavors like makers mark and bulleit. But honestly it‚Äôs good, and I think it‚Äôll get better as I put better things in it.
I've blended 2 whiskies before in attempt to balance sweet/heat. Your taking it to the next level, scratch that, next stack of levels. Please post any and all pictures in future if this comes to fruition.
No skill required honestly. I just mixed everything I had on hand. I‚Äôm going to try and curate it a little bit from now on though.
Yeah I feel like I‚Äôm going to love it. I‚Äôm already thinking about taking it down specific flavor profiles and up and down in proofs.
All I can say is that there is corn in it
Will do for sure, cheers ü•É
I have everything in there from higher barrel proofs, to the normal 80ish and everything in between. I mostly like to get the flavor down to my liking but it is fun to mess with the proofs as well."
"Found pallet, what to buy at $50","I‚Äôve recently got back into Bourbon/Whiskey and sat down last night and tasted about 10 bottles.  The winner, IMO was Knob Creek 100 Proof 9 year.  

I was going to pick up Wild Turkey Rare Breed today, but wanted to know if anyone else had any suggestions around the $50 range.  

Note, I did NOT like Woodford Reserve Double Oaked.","I‚Äôve had some booze and read this as ‚Äúfound wallet‚Äù I was about to suggest you just return the wallet with the money in it.
WT rare breed is my favorite $50 bottle and I doubt you'd be disappointed.
Stellum
I‚Äôm also a KC fan. My first pick as a next try would be Bakers 7. I love the stuff but it‚Äôs twice the price.
Still Austin Cask Strength, Four Roses SiB, and the controversial Dickle BiB 13 year.
Keep an eye out for KC single barrel 120. It‚Äôs killer.
In this economy?
I was wondering where OP found a wooden platform on which to stack merchandise to make it easier to move by forklift...
Yea this. I had a store pick once that was absolutely ridiculously good."
Midwinter‚Äôs Night Dram?,"My local guy is getting this in about a week and I‚Äôm planning on picking up a bottle. 

He‚Äôs going to have it for about $130, is this a decent price? Usually it‚Äôs like $150-200, right? Also what should I expect for tasting notes, is it similar to anything else on the market ? Is it genuinely really yummy or mostly just hype? 

Thanks in advance!","That price sounds fair for the current market.

I picked up a bottle last year.  It was good but not worth the price in my opinion.  Mostly hype.
SLB pretty much trashed it in their latest video saying Sagamore offers very similar/even better finished rye at 1/2 the price.
Good price to buy once and probably not re-purchase, but the label is damn pretty to have on your bar
The price is good comparatively but honestly the juice is just not that good.  Get much better bottles for your money.
$130 is a good price. In Michigan, it‚Äôs $150 state minimum but I‚Äôve seen it higher than that and it still sells. I remember when I could get that bottle for $80 and it was absolutely incredible at that price point. At $150 tho.. meh.
I did not like my bottle neat at all.  It made a nice manhattan however.  I would not buy another bottle.
That's about MSRP.
I think this year‚Äôs batch is worth it. Definitely not nearly as good as the fearly batches, but that‚Äôs a great price. They sell it for $125 at the distillery, so I would definitely pick it up at 130.
My favorite bottle I had in 2023, and most definitely worth the $150.00 to me.
The positive stuff you heard about this bottle is a select few who like it or those who want to like it to justify the high price. It‚Äôs a $60 bottle. I‚Äôd pass.
Not worth it. It‚Äôs at best a 60-70$ bottle
$125 msrp
$130 is ok, but still not worth what‚Äôs in the bottle imho.
That's a fantastic price, given MSRP is $150 and it's usually found at $160-200. That said, it's still too much imo.
Good price, but its still very over priced lol. Its literally a $55 bottle that is finished for 3x the price.
Really good price compared to what it goes for these days ($150+ outside of Utah). 
I‚Äôd buy it at that price. I heard this years is delicious.
I thought msrp was $125. I got mine for $135. And I think I‚Äôm done with hunting for future releases.
That price is fair for the market.  I very much enjoy the bottle, and I am not typically a fan of finished bourbons or ryes.  Retail on the bottle is definately pushing what I would want to pay for it, but I think it is worth that price when I have not found a similar profile that I enjoy as much for less.  But sure, there are better ways to spend $130 on whiskey, it just depends how much you want that bottle.
Just like with anything it all comes down to your personal taste and palate. At that price for that particular item it‚Äôs a good buy. I think it‚Äôs good but not something I have to have and at those prices especially at the higher prices there are plenty of other things I can enjoy just as much or more for less cost. So you just have to figure out what your sweet spot is, but if you want that particular one for $130 it‚Äôs a buy.
As compared to MSRP and average market price then this is a good deal. However, as a fan of MWND, I really don't think this is worth over $100. It's lower proof and it is a good dram just not a $100+ good dram. In the end, something is worth what people are willing to pay for it.


My
Price is fair relatively (below msrp) but objectively not really.  As in, me and three friends got this bottle and none of us love it. Lots of ryes I‚Äôd recommend instead.
Generally fair to market.

Do not expect it to taste like typical whiskey. The port finish is *heavy*. The palate damn near starts out as wine.
have you tried it? have you tried other finished ryes? something to consider before buying imo
I have a bottle of Sagamore Rye sherry cask finished, and it was phenomenal. Having said that I love my bottle of MWND (act 11). It needs some time to air out, but once it does it‚Äôs amazing, imo.
I'm not a big rye guy, but I recently tried a Sagamore for the first time because it came in an advent calendar and I was extremely impressed by the flavor relative to the bottle price.
It can be hard to find the 8 year and double oak sagamore but they‚Äôre definitely shoulders above most ryes. Mwnd is good and is port cask finished, it just takes awhile for the nose to open up.
Nope. Never tried and never tried finished ryes other than rye blends from across the pond.
100%. The double oak is damn good and the barrel strength rocks in Manhattans"
1st 2024 review: Old Forester 1910 and 1920!,"Old Forester 1910 and 1920 are both exceptional bourbons that cater to the discerning palate of a Blanton‚Äôs fan. The 1910, with its unique double-barrel finishing process, delivers a rich and nuanced flavor profile, reminiscent of caramel and spice. Meanwhile, the 1920 impresses with its bold and robust character, featuring deep notes of dark fruit and oak.  In terms of rating on a 10-point scale among bourbons priced below $100.00, these offerings from Old Forester easily secure a high standing. I would give Old Forester 1910 an 8.5, appreciating its complexity and smooth finish. Old Forester 1920, with its bold flavor profile, earns a solid 9, standing out as a robust and satisfying choice.  For a Blanton‚Äôs enthusiast exploring bourbons within a reasonable budget, both Old Forester 1910 and 1920 provide an excellent balance of quality and affordability, making them noteworthy contenders in the sub-$100.00 bourbon market.  Lastly, whereas the 1910 tasted of banana cream pie, that first-ever sip of 1920 smacked of the famous Old Forester banana cream pie taste!","Try the 1915 (each mixed together). Pretty interesting
Oh yeah, for sure!  I‚Äôve read about the 1915 mix, but since this was my first true experience with 1920 I wanted to give my best standalone opinion for sure!
Do you consider yourself a Blanton‚Äôs fan?"
Review #5 Barrel 10th Anniversary Blend,"When I got the email from t8ke regarding this blend, I decided I'd give it a shot. I had only had a Barrell Rye blend before, so I was fairly new to Barrell, but I was impressed by the rye I had had and the reviews I had seen. This blend was presented as kind of a pinnacle achievement for Barrell, so I was very excited to try. 

Age: 8 years (blend of 8, 13, 17, and 18 year Tennessee bourbon, 8 and 9 year Indiana bourbon, and 8 year Kentucky bourbon)

ABV: 56.3% (112.6 proof)

Mashbill: 83% corn, 10% rye, 7% malted barley 

Price: $85

Tasted neat in a Neat glass

Nose: Some slight fruit notes, coupled with oak and minerality. Definitely smells like Dickel with the age and minerality. 

Palate: Vanilla sweetness hits first, followed by some rye spice, surprising given the mashbill. A little bit of oak and heat mixed in, but they're definitely complimentary notes. This does not taste like the nose at all in my opinion, it tastes much more like Barton than Dickel.

Finish: Short and sweet. More of the oak and vanilla, but it doesn't last very long. No ethanol aftertaste either. 

Overall: It's a very nice pour. My one knock is the short finish. There's lots of flavor, definitely more than I can pick out, and all of the different blends work together very nicely. It's a great sipping whiskey and everyday pour, but while you may not taste the proof it still gets to you, so I typically only have one of these before moving onto something else. If the finish was longer, it'd be up a full rating.

Rating: 7 on the t8ke scale

Now I‚Äôm new to this actually looking for tasting notes and things but for the 1st time tonight I poured a 2oz pour of the makers mark and I can name things I actually tasted,,How long did it take you? What notes did you get?
"Review #: 001, Traveller Whiskey","Well, someone has to do it, might as well be me. And might as well be my first review here. I‚Äôll be the first to admit I‚Äôm not as ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù as most of you, but I‚Äôll give this a go and risk the possible ridicule I may face. I keep seeing this on this sub, as well as Facebook groups, so I figured for $37, why not? Worst case scenario, it‚Äôs another bottle I use as a mixer. I let this sit and breathe for like‚Ä¶30 minutes. I got busy and honestly, I wasn‚Äôt super excited to be drinking it. I‚Äôm also still fleshing out how I want to format my reviews so I totally nabbed this format from someone else for now. 

Purchased: January 2024

Distillery: Buffalo Trace

Abv: 45%

Price Paid: $37

**Nose:** Well, it‚Äôs Buffalo Trace. Smells very sweet. I smell it from a few feet away before I even pick up the glen for the next step. Smells like Smucker‚Äôs grape jelly. Picking it up and diving in, it actually smells a lot like Eagle Rare, which I enjoy very much. Also picking up some slight vanilla and toffee. 

**Mouthfeel & Palate:** Ok, up front disclosure, I‚Äôm not really the one to pick up the subtle nuances and care too much about mouthfeel. I know what smells good and tastes good in the front, middle, and finish. So I‚Äôm not the one to ask about mouthful, but I‚Äôll play along as best I can. It‚Äôs got a pretty watery mouthfeel, but I guess that‚Äôs to be expected from a 90 proofer like this. 

Up front, I get some oak. In fact, that‚Äôs mostly what I get. I get some sort of vegetal, or maybe raw wood flavor. Eagle Rare, this ain‚Äôt. Like, at all. There‚Äôs not much going on with this. There‚Äôs no real bad flavors, but there‚Äôs nothing really redeeming about it. It tastes like a pretty good cheap whiskey. 

**Finish:** The finish leaves nothing to reminisce about. A sort of raw toothpick sort of flavor. A little sweetness but nothing I can exactly pick out. 

**Final Thoughts/Recommendation:** Ok, I know none of you paid to see a comparison review, but I kept making the joke whenever I saw this that it was probably just Buffalo Trace with an autograph I didn‚Äôt care about printed on the bottle. So I just went and got a pour of Buffalo Trace to compare for myself to see if maybe I was just off tonight or if this actually WAS entirely underwhelming. Verdict: BT doesn‚Äôt smell as good as Traveller, but the taste is so much more. I don‚Äôt just taste wood and raw toothpicks. The finish actually tastes like more than‚Ä¶.raw toothpicks. 

So yeah, I‚Äôm doubling down. Traveller smells good. Sweet, grape jam, a touch of vanilla. I hazard to say smells better than Buffalo Trace (that didn‚Äôt sit to open up for 30 minutes). But I just don‚Äôt get much of anything tasty on the palette. 

**Score:** 4/10

**1 Undrinkable**

**2 Bad**

**3 Poor**

**4 Below Average**

**5 Average**

**6 Above Average**

**7 Very Good**

**8 Great**

**9 Excellent**

**10 Perfect**","Thanks for the review! This whole thing is weird. ‚ÄúSober‚Äùcelebrity whiskey, blended (likely with Canadian sazerac whiskey).
Thanks for sharing! I was so curious about trying this because it is from BT, but I don't think I'll be going out of my way to have a glass of raw toothpicks, lol.
I‚Äôll definitely be gifting mine now lol
I was told by a warehouseman at Buffalo Trace that it‚Äôs Barton blended with Canadian whiskey, nothing from Buffalo Trace distillery in the blend.
I thought the same thing. On the back of the bottle, it says it was hand picked. I joked with a friend that it better be good as hell since he apparently picked it without drinking it.
Haha your mileage may vary.
Haha, Taters dreams shattered"
Mister Sam Batch 3,"My palette is not advanced enough to write a comprehensive review on the nose, taste and finish (there‚Äôs already a few recent reviews that nail this whiskey). A fantastic nose and a forever finish this is a great whiskey, reminding me of an amplified GTS and THH with many other flavors. I will be enjoying measured pours and sharing even smaller measured pours. 
Cheers.","[deleted]
 what‚Äôs the verdict ?
I can‚Äôt pick out 7+ different smells, 7+ tasting notes but can nail the finish, not sure that type of review would really be appreciated. I do enjoy fine spirits but can‚Äôt nail everything in the glass. Cheers!"
Penelope 15yr and No-Knead Bread,"The pour: Nice vanilla on the nose. Elegantly sweet with toffee notes on the taste. Remarkably smooth for the proof with a finish that lingers.

The bread: Easy no-knead recipe, that I‚Äôve been experimenting splitting the batch in to smaller loafs that are easy to share with friends.

Perfect blend of spirits and carbs. Cheers!","How much did those set you back? Also, what did you pay for the Penelope?
Recipe?
I pick up this strange artificial note on this and the architect. It's like someone is adding plywood flavoring. Recently purchased a ECc923 so maybe my pallet is tainted now.
Probably 76 cents after tax. I paid $160 for Penelope, paid for by bread savings.
1¬Ω tablespoons yeast
1¬Ω tablespoons kosher salt
6¬Ω cups unbleached, all-purpose flour

3cups lukewarm water. Mix all the ingredients.

Let it rise for 2-5 hours then cover it and throw it in the fridge.

For this recipe I get 4 of these size loafs. Cut a little bigger than softball size of the dough, make a ball, dust with some flour and let rest 30-40 mins. While it‚Äôs resting throw a Dutch Oven in your oven and preheat at 450. 

When dough is done resting toss it in the Dutch 20-25min lid on 15-18 min lid off. 

Dough will last 2 weeks in the fridge.

Edit: Active yeast not instant.
Those are $6 loaves all day, great job!

I will be looking out for that Penelope
Thanks!"
Redbreast 27 Year,"I got into whiskey about 2 years ago, more of just a hobby thing. I really enjoy learning deep into my hobbies and Irish distilling captured my curiosity. Long story short, Redbreast has been my undisputed Irish. Fell in love with the line up and climbed up based on years. I had thoughts that this shit was way too expensive but I pulled the trigger cause you only live once. Picked it up last night and opened it today with two of my friends. ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT. This elixir has shown me time is priceless and buy cool shit and share with those close. If anyone is thinking about it pull the trigger. Got it for $550","I‚Äôm jealous. I have a milestone birthday coming up this year and am hoping to splurge and find one of these to celebrate. None in my state currently per the state ran inventory.
I have a bottle waiting for april to open it with friends to celebrate being permanent in work, I tried it in a bar and had to have a bottle of it.
I just had a flight with this and RB21 and yellow and red spot. This was on a whole other level
Create memories for sure. The bottle looks great, the box it came in looks great, you think it‚Äôs a great pour. Sounds like you got your moneys worth. What about it makes it a great taste for you?
Electrifying! I paid ‚Ç¨75 for 2oz in a Dublin. I‚Äôve never had anything like it.
This is spectacular.  Easily too 5.
Awesome! I've only had a pour of it at a bar, but it was enough to convince me to try and figure out a way to get a bottle someday.

I've also heard that the bottle itself is low key one of the more impressive bottles designs out there. It doesn't necessarily look like it, but apparently that frosted red glass is actually pretty fancy.
had the same story as you but a few years ago, was getting rb27 for about 400-450, the most recently bottle i got (maybe summer 2023) was 550, saw it at total wine last week for 850, anyway, this is one of the best whiskies ive ever had , enjoy it
An amazing bottle nothing like it
My wife and I had some drams to celebrate the new year. I pulled out a bottle of Bruichladdich Black Arts 10.1, Dewars 32, Russell‚Äôs 13 and Redbreast 21. 

I was guessing she would‚Äôve picked the Dewars 32  or the Black Arts (29 year) she ended up picking up the Redbreast 21 over the rest of the lineup and I was surprised as for me it beat the rest of the bangers.

Redbreast is delicious. I love the CS, the TP, the PX and the 21. I want to find the 27 I‚Äôve only seen it once.
I just bought Redbreast Tawny Port a few hours ago :)
This is one of the few whiskies on my bucket list.  Had the pleasure of blowing through a bottle of Red Spot on vacation recently.  Easy to do for $120 duty free
Both are fantastic. Red spot is a great place holder if you find it.
If you read the tasting notes and then try it you will probably start to tear up. It‚Äôs one of the slim few that actually write it to the taste. Absolutely incredible and a great proof at 112
The packaging is beautiful, it has a wood slit in the box that is magnetized to keep the bottle. The glass is also so satisfying.
I have been looking for the Kentucky oak Readbreast but haven‚Äôt found it. How did you like the Dewars 32? I have had the 27 and enjoyed it.
The 27 year is drinkable art. I wish I could give everyone a shot on here cause it‚Äôs a cool experience and tastes amazing
You‚Äôre making me want to snag one of each.  RB27 is $600 and RS is $240 before tax near me.
Damn sounds good. ü•≤
I‚Äôve seen the Kentucky Oak in my area a couple of times. The 27 only once and when I was ready to pull the trigger it was gone ended up getting RB21 alongside the Balvenie 21 as a consolation price. 

The Dewars 32 is delicious, I reviewed it a while back, https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/s/A82TUYkNXd

If you spot one buy it, it‚Äôs a one time bottle for me as it‚Äôs gotten expensive but delicious nonetheless. Same goes to RB I got the 21 back in June last year for $320. Last month it was $490, I can‚Äôt imagine how much will the 27 be. That time when I saw it was $550 but I haven‚Äôt seen another one since then. 

Also, I share the same sentiment, you only live once, if you can afford it buy it. I‚Äôve missed on some opportunities as I hesitated to grab a nice bottle and when I get back is late but I have also scored in other instances. Cheers man.
I‚Äôm telling you they are worth it. Don‚Äôt break an arm and leg for it but if you are in a good spot fire away. Or see if you can split it with some friends
Picking up the RB27 for sure! I‚Äôm in a good spot.  Not sure about red spot, seems a lot of folks prefer the 7yr blue over the 15 yr red."
Review #4: Jack Daniels Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye,"

Age: NAS

ABV: 64.5% (129.3 proof)

Mashbill: 70% rye, 18% corn, 12% malted barley 

Price: $65

Tasted neat in a snifter

Nose: Dill. Rye. Heat. The nose is big and bold and everything you want from a barrel proof rye. 

Palate: Rye spice is immediately apparent, along with lots of heat. The dill note is very strong, and the high malt content is also noticable with a bread flavoring. It tastes exactly like what you'd expect from the nose. 

Finish: Very long. Filled with heat and spice and dill. 

Overall: Overall, this is a fantastic rye. Jack Daniels is doing something a little different than most other Kentucky ryes, and I like it. It's very unique, and very good. It's got the classic rye spice, with some added malt and dill. Very hot, very intense, but avoiding pure ethanol burn.

I rate it on an overall whiskey scale. I'll be reviewing bourbons, ryes, American and Canadian whiskeys, and scotches on this scale, and it's a rating based on how I view the whiskey.
I think his score is accurate . I hear you this is a 9.5 for you but if you have tried JD 2020 Rye LE that blows this out the water maybe his bottle is a 7 . Mine is a 8-8.3 tops
Awesome. So like an overall enjoyment scale, I like this idea. Thanks for the notes.
Interesting. I‚Äôd love to put the JD 2020 rye LE next to the BPSB Rye.
It's delicious, but it doesn't blow me out of the water. Well above average is fair imo
Yeah. I view this as my own personal notes more than anything else, but sharing for others so maybe they can get something out of it. I plan to revisit some, see how time in the bottle and my own tastes have changed my opinion, do blinds with similar whiskeys and different batches, an infinity bottle or two, etc. I'm using the t8ke scale cus it's fairly universal at this point, but I don't want to separate the scale into different styles of whiskey rating because ultimately I'm not trying to be objective, I'm trying to be subjective to myself.
I hope you get to try it .Best Rye I‚Äôve ever had . I‚Äôm going to compare it to 2022 Thomas H. Handy . But I have a feeling that JD 2020 Rye LE is going to win .
That‚Äôs deep man. I would never be able to combine my love for rye and whiskey into one rating Scale
Handy is phenomenal but it‚Äôs definitely a bourbon forward rye. This JD SBBP rye is like the definition of rye for me."
Russell's Reserve 13 Review + More,"Hello. I have been slowly but surely going through my whiskey collection and meticulously rating and reviewing. I started doing this because I have a hobby of writing, and there have been times during tastings that buddies have told me that I've got unique, abstract takes about the flavors and experience of drinking whiskey. So, I decided to marry the hobbies.

My most recent write-up is for Russell's Reserve 13. It is one that I've been looking for all year after trying a pour at a bar (also just a WT zealot) and finally a kind friend sold me his backup. It is a delightful whiskey. I'll post that review here in the post and link out to my other ratings/reviews at the end.

[**Russell's Reserve 13-Year**](https://imgur.com/a/aiLqrxy)

[Review by Patrick White](https://www.slugstories.com/philosophic-wine/russells-reserve-13-year)

* **Proof** 114.8
* **Pour** 1 oz.
* **Tastings Completed** 3
* **Total Score** 89.9 out of 100

**Nose** Peach, pear, and apple intermingled with a discernable note of juicy hard candy activates the salivary glands. An intermediary layer of floral whispers meshes well so as to not be overbearing and gives way to a sugary dessert foundation: sugary cereal and cinnamon roll.

**Palate** The front palate is strikingly sweet and fruity. The apple transfers through the most in the form of warm, baked apple pie with nutmeg and cinnamon. As it gains momentum across the palate, aged oak and classic white pepper bloom.

**Finish** While fitting for this particular whiskey, the finish is gentle and brief. The oak pushes through and transforms into a burst of rye. The finish makes its presence known, but drinks smooth with virtually no heat, and doesn‚Äôt overstay its welcome.

**Story** Exploring acreage you were instructed not to. Rows of orange trees and alligators in ponds you remember as prehistoric beasts. The rumble of the dirt road, the buzz of grasshoppers, the ominous stillness before the daily thunderstorm. An old man playing guitar for an audience of toads.

Whenever I finish a rating/review, [I put it up on my personal website](https://www.slugstories.com/philosophic-wine). If you like my style and have any desire to follow, this is where to do it. None of this is monetized or anything, just doing it for fun.

Cheers all!","Good review but how could this possibly be a 9/10 on availability
I really appreciate your review, particularly the Nose, Palate, and Finish sections. 

I would challenge you on your rating scale. Are you a person who is willing to give a 10/10 in a particular category? If not, I think it will be very difficult for anything to score phenomenal which maybe what you are going for, but particularly w/ appearance what holds something back from being a 10 rather than a 9.3? In this review, even a 9.5 would have pushed this whiskey over to phenomenal territory. 

That is a small challenge though, and as fellow WT zealot, I think your reviews will be particularly helpful to me. I am excited  for your next review, particularly the prose.
Love the ‚Äústory‚Äù!! Amazing.

9.1 / 10
fun review. i'd post on r/bourbon as well

do you know which batch? there's a laser code near the bottom of the bottle iirc
None of my rating criteria are direct scales, they intercompare with the product. The plain English way to describe how that works for availability is:

* The highest scores are given to great whiskeys that are accessible
* High scores are still given to spectacular whiskeys that ""deserve"" their rarity
* Lower scores are given to mediocre whiskeys that are artificially inaccessible (driven by hype, etc.)

Determining whether a whiskey ""deserves"" its rarity is all just my own opinion/subjective experience & observation of course.

I have been told in the past that this category and ""affordability"" should probably be renamed due to this, but I haven't figured out any good alternatives yet.
I consider the loose descriptors of the total score (not good, good, great, phenomenal) to be somewhat of an afterthought. They are there for someone who isn't interested in any sort of depth and just wants to see vaguely what I think about it. My back end spreadsheet doesn't even have those descriptions anywhere. I consider this to be a phenomenal whiskey even though it's just a hair off.

I tend to sort of let the system inform the score in that way. This might feel bizarre for some people but it has offered me some conclusions that I wouldn't have arrived at otherwise, such as --

* My ""favorite"" whiskey actually only scored 92/100. My conclusion here is that there's still some space above what I've had the opportunity to taste.
* Since then, I have scored a *different* whiskey 92.1/100, even though I still think my favorite is generally better. This forced me to conclude that for me at least, my enjoyment is based on *a ton* of factors that can't be easily quantified.

There are other examples, those are just off the dome. I'm not above re-rating entries, so as I get more feedback, I will certainly evolve the system.

Re: the ""aesthetics"" category you mentioned, it's fairly meticulously rated. My back end guidance has it split into 3 separate ratings --

1. 4 points dedicated to the look of the bottle, label design, and color & viscosity/FAE action of the actual whiskey.
2. 3 points dedicated to the aroma. Note: Not the ""nose,"" more so just the baseline level of pleasantry -- is it soft/gentle or harsh/inaccesible?
3. 3 points dedicated to the tactile ""mouth feel"" of the whiskey.

I hope that answers any of the follow up you had. If not, just let me know. And, thank you for the kind words! If you like to read just in general, the site I linked has all sorts of writing all over the place. Especially relevant if you enjoy weird lit/experimental fiction.
It's batch 5!
You must literally live inside the Wild Turkey Distillery if you think this bottle is remotely obtainable for most ppl but ooookay.
I believe ‚ÄúFulfilling‚Äù is better based on your description. High scores show a quality drink is as good as it is sought after. ‚ÄúAvailability‚Äù is misleading
9 out of 10 on availability should mean it's available 90% of the time in your liquor store. 

Also, the purpose of a point scale is to not have decimals (until you take the overall average).  Like your flavor scale was 27.**7** out of 30. WTF is that? Just make it a 100 point scale, or realistically there's no difference here between 27.7 and 27.6, so you need to stick to whole numbers, it should get a 28.
nice, i have an unopened bottle of your batch! i tried it at a bar and went on a quest to find a bottle. i agree with your notes, although it's been a while, what i remember most was that unique fruit flavor
Noted.

I don't know how else to explain this category isn't a direct measure of how obtainable a bottle is, but it's clearly confusing/not playing well with y'all so I'm taking that into consideration.
""Fulfillment"" definitely strikes closer to the concept, thanks for the suggestion!
I do see what you're saying, but just to offer an explanation, the flavor rating actually covers 3 separate aspects: nose, palate, and finish (predictably). Each of those is out of 10, which works out because I wanted flavor to be weighted 30% of the overall score. However, I knew I would want more granularity than 10 points for those categories, so instead of increasing those to 100 (and total score to 1000, which just instinctively feels bloated), I decided to use decimals.

This is just what works for me, but I can understand the criticism. Hopefully you can get some value out of the review, if not the rating. Cheers ü•É
Yup. Like a dang jolly rancher in some ways."
Review #2: Heaven's Door Revelation Double Barrel Whiskey,"In general, celebrity alcohol brands are not well regarded, but I decided to give this one a try for a few reasons. First, I like Bob Dylan. Second, this particular brand seemed a little more well thought out than your general celebrity alcohol. They had well aged stock, and co-founded by the guy who founded Angels Envy. So here's my review of one of their stock options. 

Age: 6 years

ABV: 50% (100 proof)

Mashbill: Unknown, but a blend of 2 bourbons and a rye. 

Price: ~$50

Tasted neat in a snifter.

Nose: Oak and ethanol. For 6 years you can smell some extra age, probably from the double barreling. But there's a surprising amount of ethanol for only 100 proof. 

Palate: More oak. Remarkably smooth, especially with the ethanol on the nose. Well balanced mouthful with oak and sweet spice. 

Finish: Medium length, and pleasant. No ethanol or bitterness. The spice stays for a bit and then slowly fades out. 

Overall: It's a nice whiskey, and one I definitely don't regret buying, but probably wouldn't buy again. It's a nice whiskey, and arguably worth the money, but there's options I prefer at and below that price point. It's a pleasant everyday sipper, makes a great old fashioned, but for $50 I'd rather get Rare Breed, 4R SiB, or Bardstown Origin bourbons off the top of my mind. 

Rating: 5/10 on the t8ke scale

1 | Disgusting | So bad I poured it out

2 | Poor | I wouldn't drink by choice

3 | Bad | Multiple flaws

4 | Sub par | Not bad, but better exists

5 | Good | Good, just fine

6 | Very good | A cut above

7 | Great | Well above average

8 | Excellent | Really quite exceptional

9 | Incredible | An all time favorite

10 | Perfect | Perfect",
The Traveller Has Arrived,"Fire up the hype machine there‚Äôs a new BT bottle haunting the shelves. Didn‚Äôt expect it this early in the year but there it was on the shelf at 90 proof for $39.99, as promised. The result of a collaboration between Harlen Wheatley and singer Chris Stapleton who supposedly reviewed 50 different blends and settled on this one, number 40. Have only done a quick preliminary tasting but here are my notes:

Nose: There‚Äôs more than bourbon happening but but bourbon certainly the forward whiff. Sweet corn and vanilla. Very little spice. 

Palate: Nothing heavy here and the sweet corn from the nose comes in strong. Vanilla and toffee follow with a surprising amount of spice for a 90 proof. This caught me off guard after detecting none in the nose.

Finish: Spice lingers just long enough to remember it. More heat than expected here but very easy drinker.

Overall this goes down very easily and I‚Äôm looking forward to spending some more time with it. I‚Äôve seen some very early comparisons to ETL and I couldn‚Äôt help but dust off my 6 year old bottle to do a side by side. I‚Äôll be damned if there aren‚Äôt some striking similarities on the nose and palate, the key difference being the ETL brought a lot more oil on the palate and just felt fuller bodied with more toffee and caramel, making the Traveller taste a bit thin in comparison. Will be interesting to put this one up against regular BT.  Even more interesting will be to see if this one stays on shelves or vanishes into the back rooms and museum cases of our favorite purveyors. I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs quite worth all that, but it‚Äôs absolutely worth MSRP and a spot on your middle shelf. 

Rating 6.9","This label is a mess. ‚ÄúBlended and bottled by Buffalo Trace‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt say where it‚Äôs distilled (the verbiage indicates multiple distilleries, but no state of distillation is listed), no age statement, no real info other than the proof. I‚Äôll pass.
All the shit talkers on this bottle they haven't tried blows me away. I got 2 bottles of this stuff and very glad I did. No matter what the label says or what's actually in it, it's a solid pour for 40 bucks MSRP, dessert bomb imo.
I tried this and I would pick any of the Benchmarks offerings over it, probably the worst Buffalo Trace product ever.
Light whiskey at low proof is generally ass. I will not be buying this bottle.
A new Buffalo Trace product on the shelf, and at msrp no less?

What will happen next? Dogs and cats living together?!?üòâ
Been hearing from those who drank it that it smells good but the taste is thin. Not as good as regular Buffalo Trace. Sounds like a beginners bourbon. Maybe a $20 bourbon with a $20 celebrity name price hike. People see the Buffalo Trace name and scoop it up and then talk themselves into believing it‚Äôs good to justify paying $40.
I‚Äôm at a complete loss. Chris Stapleton said he is sober and hasn‚Äôt drank for years. I just read about it recently.
It's Buffalo trace watered down with Canadian whiskey. No thanks but like all things Buffalo trace it will be over rated and of course sold for 3 times the price. This 40$ bottle is already going for 120. Stop being a sheep.
I'm guessing some Early Times made it into this.
I can‚Äôt find anything in the Pittsburgh area!!
[deleted]
Wtf, it‚Äôs not straight whiskey, and like is Tennessee distillate a possibility?
Completely agree.  It's a very solid pour and worth the msrp price.  I picked up a  couple bottles last week and actually went back and got some more to keep for some back ups.
It‚Äôs a solid $40 whiskey. Was very pleased with how it tasted. Would absolutely buy it again when I run out.
It's pretty decent. It's  definitely better than basil hayden for being in the 40 dollar price point. It's light- has a nice carmel and vanilla note, i like it.
And Benchmark is more of a BT product than this stuff realistically. This is some sort of blended frankenwhiskey with some undisclosed amount of BT in it, bottled at BT to capitalize on the name IMHO.
I just picked up a bottle tonight- you are right that it's very light. It beats the 40 dollar basil hayden in my opinion.  But I'd honestly rather have wild turkey 101, which is cheaper.  I like the carmel notes and the vanilla taste for sure. But i don't think this is a 40 dollar bottle.  I will say that it is more of a 40 dollar bottle than BH though. But I'd personally rather have a wild turkey offering
I just picked up a bottle tonight. It's very light- kinda like basil hayden, it has carmel and vanilla, and dried fruit tastes to it. It's 80 proof just like basil hayden.  Personally, it's good, i don't hate it. But i enjoyed the cheaper bottle of wild turkey 101 a lot more
100%. The TTB definition of ‚ÄúBlended Whiskey‚Äù is a Whiskey produced by blending not less than 20% on a proof gallon basis (excluding alcohol derived from adding harmless coloring, flavoring, or blending materials) straight whiskey or a blend of straight whiskies and, separately or in combination, whiskey of any type or neutral spirits. 

I saw somewhere else that they are claiming zero neutral spirits in the blend, so my guess is that the whiskey is sourced from a variety of states and the majority is too young to be considered straight whiskey (at least 2 years aged) and/or as someone else mentioned includes whiskey from Canada.

If it was all from the US and appropriately aged they could call it Blended Bourbon Whiskey (assuming it‚Äôs at least 51% straight bourbon whiskies) or something of the like depending on what‚Äôs in the blend.
I hear is was branded whiskey more for marketing to cash in one his Tenn whiskey song and nothing to do with the build
IMHO probably some Canadian whiskey in it as well. The fact that they don't even try to call it a blended American whiskey makes me think it has to have some foreign distillate.
With the ‚ÄúBlended Whiskey‚Äù designation anything is a possibility.
It's Canadaian whiskey
Totally agree. I would WT 101 over Travelers or any BH product.
Where you get it ?
I'm in Michigan.
Ah damn, was hoping you would say Pittsburgh
My local liquor store had 8 bottles"
Best Rye I‚Äôve Ever Tasted‚Ä¶üëèüèæ,"I popped this open last night and it‚Äôs fantastic. It‚Äôs the best rye that I have ever tasted. The nose alone is amazing. Wow, this was just a neck pour. I can only imagine how this will be in a few weeks or months. This was definitely worth the purchase ($144.99 before taxes). I was really big on the Sagamore 8 year, but this is on another level, even at 92.8 proof.  I will do a full review soon. Cheers ü•É.","Michters 10 under $200 üò≥üëè
Try their Barrel Proof once.....  That is a treat.
I love everything Michter's!!!
That's that object in front?
Love that bottle.  If you can get your hands on a 2023 Michters Bourbon, do it. It's even better.
Easily the best rye I‚Äôve ever had as well
It's decent, but for KY Rye the conversation starts and ends with Black Maple Hill. Bottomline is the best rye is from PA, the cradle of American whiskey. Indiana has some interesting output that they ship everywhere for rebottling. KY is corn country, home of bourbon, not rye.
Yes, I was stoked as well. I was expecting to pay around $200. I guess Total Wine had the old SRP in their system. It was $149.99 for the 2023 bottle and I had a $5 reward coupon. I walked out smiling üôÇ. I am even happier that it‚Äôs a fantastic bottle. It‚Äôs so flavorful on the nose and palate.
Will definitely be on the lookout for the barrel proof rye. I can only imagine how much more flavorful it may be. I have the Barrel Strength bourbon that I got from the distillery and it‚Äôs a great pour as well. I will compare them side by side, but I think I prefer this one at the moment. It‚Äôs much more complex on the nose and palate.
I agree Barrel proof, toasted & 10yr Rye.  Can't go wrong
I have this and the Barrel Strength bourbon. Both are great pours. I hope to find some of their other limited releases at some point.
It‚Äôs a Maker‚Äôs Mark jigger
I will definitely be on the hunt. Was lucky to get this one. I happen to call Total Wine unknowingly after their Grand Reserve event and was asking about Hardin‚Äôs Creek Jacob‚Äùs Well. He said that he had just sold the last bottle. I asked what he had left. He had the M10 Year Rye, KC18, 2XO, and Jacob‚Äôs Pardon 18. I already had the KC18. He was about to put the Michter‚Äôs on the shelf and I asked him to hold it for me. I was there in 10 minutes üòÇ.
It‚Äôs definitely a special bottle. I‚Äôm confirming that the 2023 bottle is worth the hunt. I would get a backup bottle if I could find it for the same price.
Black Maple Hill hasn't been Kentucky-sourced [in over a decade](https://whiskyauctioneer.com/news/enigmatic-story-black-maple-hill). The stuff you speak of, the legendary era, was rumored to be old Stitzel‚ÄìWeller stock, as well as some particularly choice Heaven Hill barrels. Since 2014, they are sourced from an Oregon distillery named Stein.

Their story reads a lot like Very Olde St Nick. Current production has almost nothing to do with the legendary bottles they became known for. They built brand-reputation on some amazing barrels from very-storied producers and can't source anything remotely as good today.
I‚Äôve heard of Black Maple Hill but never knew the rye was that good. I will have to get a sample pour and try it out.
I haven't had a rye better than Pikesville
That worked out nicely.  Enjoy it üôå
That worked out nicely.  Enjoy it üôå
You would definitely be doing yourself a favor. Thanks to seeing your post, I am having a .5oz pour of the Bomberger's üòÇ
You are correct. Never buy the Oregon knockoff.
Black Maple Hill hasn't been ""that good"" in over a decade. Nor has it been sourced from Kentucky in over a decade. Those bottles are loooooong since gone.
I have been seeing a lot of Bomberger‚Äôs and Shenks in the area. What‚Äôs your take on Bomberger‚Äôs? Since I have the Barrel Strength bourbon, I wondered if it was worth the hunt.
Totall different taste profile. They used malted rye in the mash bill and also aged it in toasted & charred Chinquapin casks!! This years realease is excellent. In 2022, I prefered the Shenks release but I think Bomberger's gains the edge this year!!
Thanks for the feedback and Cheers my friend ü•É

Best Whiskeys of 2023," 

First of all, I‚Äôd like to state (which will likely become obvious here shortly) that I am not a professional bourbon taster. I usually struggle to pick out notes that the majority of Whiskey Tubers come up with and normally just resort to ""This is good‚Äù or ‚ÄúI hate this, take it away‚Äù. This is just a hobby for me and is actually the first double-blind that I have participated in. Hopefully, it won't be the last.

Method:

I took 24 of my favorite bourbons that I picked up in 2023. Most were released in 2023 with the exceptions being Bookers 2022-04 and Stagg Batch 18. I then ‚Äúseeded‚Äù them 1-4 based on how much I typically enjoy them, 1 being on the lower end (Blanton‚Äôs) and 4 being the higher end (Knob Creek 18, which I fell in love with at first sip and have been hunting for ever since). I gave each bottle a random number 1-24, bottled them all into sample bottles with their seed and random numbers written on them, and then threw away the key. From my memory, anyway‚Ä¶

For each of the knockout rounds, I took four random samples out of the pool, one from each seed level, and tasted them. I assigned each round a winner and was shocked, and dare I say, slightly disappointed at the results after just the first round.

Results:

After the first round I flipped over the glass of the bourbon I‚Äôd declared the winner and was shocked to see that not only was the ‚Äúseed‚Äù number not a four, not even a three, but a TWO?!!! Had I done something wrong? Had I mislabeled the glasses? No way a ‚Äú2‚Äù beat a ‚Äú4‚Äù. But, after double-checking that I had in fact not done any mislabeling, I pressed on with the second batch of four samples for the night, a little anxious and seriously doubting my tasting skills and considering halting the experiment right then and there. 

By the way, I will include my rather crude tasting notes for each glass at the bottom to spare you from them here.  

After the second round was done  I flipped over the winner and my heart skipped a beat when I saw the ‚Äú4‚Äù scribbled on the bottom. Ok, I‚Äôm not a total screw-up. Maybe my seeding just wasn‚Äôt the best. But turning over the second place caught me off guard again. A ‚Äú2‚Äù had come in second place, not a ‚Äú3‚Äù like I had been expecting. Maybe the 2‚Äôs were just way better than I had originally thought. Maybe stripping away the hype and luster of a ‚Äú3‚Äù or ‚Äú4‚Äù seed made them more like a ‚Äú2‚Äù in terms of taste. Interesting. 

Anyway, over the course of a few days, I completed the knockout round. One more ‚Äú4‚Äù joined the top finishers followed by three ‚Äú3‚Äù‚Äôs. In one of the rounds a ‚Äú1‚Äù came in second and in another a ‚Äú4‚Äù came in dead last. Ok, WTF? What is going on here? Doubts kept creeping up in my mind. But none worse than what came next.

So, with the samples ranked from each round, I took the top 6 and blinded them. I thought it would be more difficult to pick the top of the top, but it actually proved less difficult than some of the knockout rounds. Six bourbons in one flight is difficult to manage, but after tasting one sample I would ask myself if I liked it more or less than the one before it and that mentality helped out a ton. 

And the winner is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Elijah Craig B523

What? This was even more shocking to me than seeing George T Stagg at #15 on Fred Minnick‚Äôs list of 2023 while Larceny C923 was at #2. I knew I liked Elijah Craig B523, but I could have sworn I liked the C923 variant better. But apart from that, prior to doing this experiment, I could have named 10 other bourbons in my collection that I would have ranked higher than it. After all, I had ‚Äúseeded‚Äù it at a ‚Äú3‚Äù and even considered making it a ‚Äú2‚Äù. The only saving grace was that what I'd gone into this thinking was my favorite bourbon for the year, the Knob Creek 18 had come in second overall. I was worried that its lower proof would get dominated by all the barrel-proof entries in the mix, but I‚Äôm glad it didn‚Äôt.

Anyway, here are my picks for the top 12:

1. Elijah Craig 523
2. Knob Creek 18
3. Larceny BP 923
4. Larceny BP 523
5. Elijah Craig 923
6. Barrell Batch 35
7. Found North Peregrine
8. Booker's 2023-04
9. Benchmark Full Proof
10. Bardstown Discovery #11
11. Knob Creek 9 Single Barrel
12. EH Taylor Small Batch

Conclusion:

This was a ton of fun. Once I took away the pressure of feeling that I needed to be ‚Äúright‚Äù in picking each round based on ‚Äúseed‚Äù, and just took the time to discover each whiskey in the glasses in front of me, I really enjoyed the process. I will say, however, that I will be taking these results with a grain of salt, and I think you should too. My palate differed from night to night (as you‚Äôll likely see in the tasting notes). Yours does too. 

I enjoy the bourbon that I enjoy and if the hype and label of a bottle makes it taste better to me on any given day, then that is the bourbon I will say is the best on that day. It is interesting to taste bourbon for what it is without any of that though and I will likely do this experiment again. 

The other conclusion that I drew from this was that the type of glassware really does have an impact on the whiskey experience. This was my first time drinking from a Glencairn and I really enjoyed doing so. It makes it so much easier to pick out notes, especially on the nose. If you‚Äôve never tasted whiskey from one, I highly recommend you try it. There's also the issue of the order in which bourbons are placed in a blind. Many things can decide how whiskies would place in a blind. 

Thank you for reading this if you‚Äôve made it this far! And if you like what I did or recommend a different approach, please let me know.

If you believe a particular bourbon is great or rare or expensive, your mind is pre-conditioned to enjoy it more.  And studies have shown that you actually DO enjoy something more if you believe it is special.  Blind tastings eliminate all of that.

Part of the reason things like Stagg or Pappy get such high ratings is because we believe that they should be soooo good and so we therefore actually do enjoy them more because of that.  Not that they aren‚Äôt fine bourbons on their own, but we tend to believe they are better in part because we want them to be.
I did a blind of EC523, 923, and Bernheim 923 with my brother and pops over the holidays. We all ranked 523 over the 923 by a hair.
Did a Larceny 923 in a tasting over the holidays and out of 9 people it had 3 oks 6 dislikes including me. I maybe got a bad bottle.  On the other hand Found North Batch 8 had 7 likes and 2 ok. Crazy how different tastings can end up
Great writeup. B523 was one of my favorite bottles of the year I was surprised how much trashing of it I saw online.  

Have you had any of the other recent Barrells? I haven't had 35 yet but really liked 33 and 34.
Post title should be ‚ÄúBest Bourbon of 2023‚Äù seeing as how you‚Äôve not included not only American single malts, but any whisky from anywhere else on this great big planet.
Thanks! The only other Barrells I‚Äôve had were Dovetail, Seagrass and a single barrel, but after this I‚Äôll probably order another 35 and am excited for their next releases."
C923 off,"I was lucky enough to score a few bottles of each. Both were purchased at Msrp for 65$ 
I did a bling tasting. I was surprised to like the Larceny better than the EC!  I found the EC to have some more bitter notes, feel thinner and a more abrupt finish. Both bourbons sat in a rocks glass for 10 before tasting. 
 
I would recommend both of these bottles.","Do you prefer wheated bourbons? and the EC is very oaky which might explain the bitterness.
I‚Äôm going to do a bling tasting soon
ECBP c923 is definitely a goody.
Larceny bp c923 bout to be allocated. It‚Äôs in my top 20. Fred minick had it #2 on his top 100 this year beating out literally everything
This makes me feel a bit better about not owning a bottle of ECBP C923
I‚Äôve enjoyed half the bottle already. Was completely not expecting the results.
There‚Äôs no better way to do it. Bling is where it‚Äôs at.
For sure. It‚Äôs a great bottle! I‚Äôm going to be enjoying these bottles for years."
Old Elk Wheated Bourbon Cosmic Wheat III Review (Review #1),"I know you all likely don't need another guy reviewing bourbons, but this is more for my own notes than anything else. If anyone gets something from this, even better. 

Whiskey: Old Elk Wheated Bourbon r/Bourbon pick. 

Age: 8 years 10 months

ABV: 57.3% (114.6 proof)

Mashbill: 51% corn, 45% wheat, 4% malted barley.

Price $120 MSRP, bought for $70 on sale. 

Drank neat in a snifter glass.

Nose: Lots of ethanol on the nose, it's difficult to snift anything else out. I let it sit for several minutes, but it didn't dissipate. I think there's a hint of sweetness there, but it's tough to tell. Like a very faint scent of baking bread. 

Mouthful: Thick. Oily. It's probably the sweetest wheated bourbon I've ever had, but in a good way. You can taste the age, but there's very little oak influence. The wheat is overpowering everything else for the most part. The proof is not noticable at all. 

Finish: More wheated sweetness, but evaporates relatively quickly. You get a bit of the bite of proof, but it's barely there. You get a bit more oak on the finish than the mouthful, funnily enough. 

Overall: It's a nice whiskey. If you enjoy wheated bourbons, this is probably up your alley. The age definitely gives it a more viscous mouthful compared to other wheated bourbons, and despite the high proof, there's little bite and spice like Larceny Barrel Proof. I oscillate on the ranking, it's very mood dependent for me. Overall, I give it a 7 on the t8ke scale, an 8 if I'm in a wheated mood.","Glad you like it. I had a barrel pick of OE Wheated from a local store. It had an anise/black licorice finish, and that's one flavor i pick up on and cant stand. I tried it after a couple weeks, and about 6 mths hoping it'd open up and change... I eventually gave the bottle away to a buddy who liked it.
one of the t8ke Cosmic Wheat picks that i got was one of the best wheaters i‚Äôve ever tasted"
Unicorn Flight Pour 1 Review-M10 Bourbon ‚ÄúA‚Äù Batch,"I‚Äôll post these reviews over the next few hours. I am opening these one at a time with ample time between, to totally clear my palate and appreciate each one individually, versus unintentionally judging them against each other in a flight back to back.

This is the A batch of this years Michters 10 Bourbon. Supposedly, this first batch has juice in it that‚Äôs much much older than 10-I‚Äôve heard everywhere from 15 to 18 year old bourbons.

Dark amber color, thick legs on the glen. Let rest about 10 minutes.

Nose: it smells OLD. Comparing to other 10-12 year old bourbons I have, this has the nose of something much older. Sweet oak, maple, toasted marshmallow, toffee. There‚Äôs a fruit note in there, sort of stone fruit-plum?  Vanilla buttercream. This is an excellent nose.

Palate: the sweet oak shines through, and opens into a lot from the nose. Vanilla cream (accentuated by the viscosity/creaminess), toasted sugar, toffee, some milk chocolate-almost heath bar without the bright butter flavor in the toffee. I don‚Äôt get the stone fruit, but the flavors that are there are so rounded and balanced. No spice, which I‚Äôm not mad about.

Finish: long and drawn out. The flavors really coat the whole mouth and sit there. I got ZERO ethanol, on a fresh open and a neck pour. Chewing keeps the flavors going, and brings out the slightest baking spice.

This is an excellent bourbon and really sets the tone for the next 3 pours. Michters nails flavor punch in low proof better than anyone in the game.

9.2/10","M10 is one of my favs but here‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand price wise:
Eagle Rare 10-year $45
Henry McKenna 10-year $52
Russell‚Äôs Reserve 10-year $40
Michter‚Äôs 10-year $350.   

It‚Äôs good yes. But is it 8x better (price wise) than other great 10 years?
Crack the others then send the pic üí™
Totally get what you mean. FWIW I paid $199, but I‚Äôd say with THIS bottle it‚Äôs worth it. Jealous you‚Äôre somewhere where HMK is $52, it‚Äôs like $75 here
The M10 has older barrels blended into it.  The others do not.  You can taste the dusty in it.

I downvoted myself.

[great review](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/138l2u2/michters_10_year_bourbon_2023_review/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1) with link to preds review and info as well.  Great bottle all in all.  I like it better than the 10y rye I just opened.  For now.
Ain't just M10 charging the premium so I can think of two reasons:
1.   In general, there are definitely superior barrels which distillers set aside for pricier stuff. Parker's Heritage 10 year Rye, ORVW10, or a Master's Keep.
2.  In specifics, most distilleries pump it into the barrel at 125 proof. Michters dilutes it to 103 before aging. The dilution before barreling results in fewer bottles per batch of mash overall. That's one of the reasons Michter's is significantly more expensive.

But really, it's about charging what they can get.  Look at how much RR13 jumped this year or MK Voyages.  Fwiw, I have tried Parker's 10 back to back with Sagamore 8. I wouldn't pay for the Parker's when the Sagamore is a shelfer. But to each their own.
I‚Äôve already posted all 4 open lol. Look on the sub for the reviews, I posted them as I opened them
I‚Äôm jealous you can get M10 for $199! Lol. I‚Äôll trade you 4 HMKs for 1 M10 alllllll day long :)
It‚Äôs a single barrel product, not a blend. 

Barrels have never been younger than twelve years, and are regularly as old as 14-15 years. They drink more like a twenty year old because of the low barrel entry proof, and steam heat cycled warehouses.
As for ER10 that‚Äôs not entirely true (or at least it‚Äôs not the whole story). I‚Äôve done the Buffalo Trace tour 3X now. According to them, ‚ÄúEagle Rare used to be a true Single Barrel bourbon, but no longer is. Eagle Rare is still bottled one barrel at a time, but now it‚Äôs done on a line (automated) which means that some bottles will have the last whiskey from one barrel and the first whiskey from the next. So, ‚ÄúSingle Barrel‚Äù isn‚Äôt 100% guaranteed any more and Buffalo Trace has removed it from the label (except for special ERSB bottles). Henry McKenna is guaranteed to be Single Barrel 10-year.
I sit corrected.  Thanks!

it doesn't, because you get to pick from various barrels to choose what flavors you want in yours."
A gift! Of whiskey. But what am I tasting?,"I was gifted this bottle of Johnnie Walker Red Label for Christmas by a client.
Couldn't nail down all of my tasting notes though.

Nose: Berries
Tongue: Blackberry, wine-ish
Finish: Oaky, some unknown fruit?","I haven't had Red in a while (I'm a fan of Black and, of course, Blue when I get that opportunity). Red is the baseline for Johnnie Walker, so not very complex but should be smooth to drink.
I am suprised you were able to sense fruit in it.

For me its just smoke, spice and some oak, just twose and maybe some nuance of vanilla

And lets not forget the burn.
Tasting notes for red label

Nose - ethanol, smoke, light oak
Palate - sandpaper with oak dust residue scraping every inch of the throat all the way down, followed by some lighter fluid that someone ignited just prior to sipping

/s   lol I do think it‚Äôs a great mixer for spiked apple cider‚Ä¶. It cuts through the sweet and definitely serves a purpose.
Red label is the ultimate NO for me.
Honestly, it's utter shite.
If there is nothing else and you want a drink then mix it with ginger wine (whisky mac).
Oh no, just not Redü•¥
Mix with cola and forget next day!

I received also some reds before and I donated to friend restaurant for mix to some food‚Ä¶

Sorry, I can‚Äôt handle it anymore.
Ah yes my first scotch.
For me Red is Smokey old socks
This is not Whisky, please stop giving these people your money!
I dont understand why ppl hate jw red. I liked it, tbh.
I understand it was gifted, but do yourself a favor and buy a decent bottle to enjoy if you really want to start in this path! We don't even understand why they make red labels as it's not drinkable in any way!
...they took him back to see the doctor, 
and the doctor just shook his head, 
the only thing that was wrong with him was Johnny Walker's Red...
That might explain why I'm not tasting much on the finish. 

I'd call it a good mixer.
I am sorry but, all Johnnie Walker is baseline Whisky in any regard.
I wouldn't call the Red Label *smooth.*
I prefer my whiskey neat, but if ever there was a scotch asking to be used in a rob roy it's this one."
A humble review of Cream of Kentucky 16,"Happy New Years Eve Reddit! Given the amount of engagement on my last Cream of Kentucky post, I figured I owed you all a review of the juice. And I just want to preface this by saying that I am by no means a whiskey aficionado or expert. I really started getting into whiskey a few years ago, so my palette is still developing and learning. 

Anyway, let‚Äôs get into it. Last night the wife and I cracked open the Cream of Kentucky, 16 year old, 116 proof, bottle #447.

First impression: on the nose, the most prevalent note is cherry. I also get hints of caramel, some vanilla, maybe molasses. Overall, very sweet lovely smell that made my mouth water in anticipation. 

On the palate, after an initial slight burn, the sweetness really comes through- the cherry, vanilla, and molasses. I see why they call it the Cream of Kentucky, it is super buttery and oily and it lingers on the tongue. For a 16 yr old bourbon, it was not oaky at all, which I liked. 

By far my favorite part about this whiskey was the finish. It is so complex, it just changes its flavors as it lingers. It just gets better with every sip. 

Overall, I really enjoyed this bourbon. Every sip was delicious and I have a feeling it will  get even better as it opens up. With that being said, the price of $299 is a little steep. Honestly, while I really enjoyed this bottle, I don‚Äôt see myself buying it again. In my opinion, $200 would be a better price point for it. 

Lastly, for comparison, last weekend I tried both old rip and Blanton‚Äôs gold at a buddy‚Äôs house. In my humble opinion, the Cream of Kentucky beats both. So there you have it. Hope you all enjoy the new year! Cheers! My drink of choice for new years will be Michter‚Äôs 10 rye! 

P.S the wife liked it as well, but the burn was a bit much for her.","Your review affirms the rumors about this being Barton distillate with predominant cherry notes.
I think about the price of whiskey when I buy it. I forgot about the price before I start drinking it. That way all that matters is if it‚Äôs good or bad. 

Looks like a great bottle.
With and extra 10 or so proof points and nearly double the price of Calumet 16. Whoo-wee."
Widow Jane 10: Review,"Tonight I am sipping on some Widow Jane 10.

Batch 861 | Bottle 189 | 2023 | 91 Proof

This is one of my favorite bourbons at a lower proof. Widow Jane does not produce their own distillate, instead they source 5 barrels from around the country and that is what makes their batch. They are based out of Brooklyn, NY and they proof it down with limestone water from the ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù Rosendale Mines. 

The first Widow Jane I had was about 2 and a half years ago. I had the 10 year, 13 year, and 15 year. I found the 13 year to be the best but it is hard to come by. This batch blows the last batch I had out of the water. Barrels were sourced out of KY, TN, and IN for this batch. So probably MGP, Bartons, and Dickel barrels. 

On the nose I get a lot of cherry cola notes. Some apple pie coming through as well. A little bit of vanilla, but cherry cola really is dominating here. 

On the palate the cherry comes through again. Baking spice and apple pie flavors. Definitely some oak in this, which is expected for 10+ year barrels. Not so much vanilla anymore. Overall the flavor really matches the aroma. You get a little mineral notes that makes me think there is some Dickel in here but it‚Äôs not unpleasant (I don‚Äôt like Dickel).

The finish is pleasant but not the longest lasting as it‚Äôs only 91 proof. This bourbon continues to get better as you drink though. 

Overall, this is a great tasting bourbon that I wouldn‚Äôt recommend at this price point. Honestly, it‚Äôd make a great gift though to beginners and bourbon lovers. I like a lot about this bottle, just not the price. 

What‚Äôre your thoughts on Widow Jane?","How much did you pay for the bottle? I‚Äôve found it for $56 and think it‚Äôs a decent price point. But I‚Äôve seen it on the shelf for $80 too and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd buy it at that price point.
On more thing i‚Äôll add to this review that I left out. This is my favorite whiskey bottle shape on the entire market. There is nothing better visually and ergonomically out there. Once I kill this bottle, this will be my infinity bottle.
It‚Äôs a great bottle at $40 I have no clue why they put it at about double that.
I like that I can get it at Mijer anytime! A good pour
I am a fan of this bottle too btw. It gets even better as it opens as well.
One of my favorite dessert pours. Wish it was a bit cheaper
Naturally I didn‚Äôt list the price in my review because‚Ä¶ um reasons. This clocked in at $78.98 in the great state of Virginia. At 56 bucks I‚Äôd recommend that buy.
I‚Äôm pretty sure the state minimum in Michigan is real close to $80  some people can‚Äôt be price picky
just tried for the first time, decent bourbon, better bottle
Nothing special about that bottle IMHO. Now JD special releases on the other hand‚Ä¶
We all have our own taste buds but I‚Äôd happily buy this at $50. The low proof definitely brings it down for me though. I understand their selling point is the NY water so they have to proof it down, but 91 is too low for me. I think $45 should be MSRP for this.
I agree. It‚Äôs always good to find something good that will always be on the shelf.
I‚Äôve been eyeing their paradigm rye and applewood rye recently. They are on the cheaper side right around $50. Any experience on WJ ryes?
Yeah it truly is a great sweet bourbon. The biggest flavor comparison I find would be a cherry coke float with vanilla ice cream.
I find the simplicity makes it perfect. I do like a JD bottle special bottle especially in a miniature.
Yea kinda agree I‚Äôd say 45 is the tops.  For me personally there‚Äôs no way this is better than Rare Breed or Eagle Rare.
Haven‚Äôt tried the ryes yet. I have been eyeing them too and have been on the fence about pulling the trigger. Lol. Eventually, they will get me on one of their ryes. Just a matter of time. Lol
I picked a bottle of the Paradigm Rye up yesterday and love it, but i admittedly am a big fan of the WJ flavor profile that most seem to think it lacks and I do not have a sophisticated palette. WJ10 is one of my favorites. Based on your review, I would recommend giving it a shot. Sorry I‚Äôm a little late to the party.
Oh no it‚Äôs certainly not better than Rare Breed. That‚Äôs the biggest issue with this bottle, you are paying for the water in it. 

That‚Äôs what ultimately makes me not want to recommend it to buy. You get a good flavor in my opinion, but you are missing out on finish, proof, and value. But this is a nice gift bottle because I‚Äôd be happy to drink it if I didn‚Äôt pay for it myself.
Alright if I pick one up i‚Äôll shoot you a message
Thanks for the info. I may pick it up if my store has it. We also got a widow jane applewood rye too.
Yea you know it‚Äôs kinda funny I recently bought one for a friend‚Äôs birthday but after sampling it at a bar, I was not into its utter lack of complexity. Went right back to where I got it and exchanged it for an Eagle rare 10 with $40‚Äôback in my pocket. The birthday boy was stoked too.
Nice!!! Thanks!
Maybe i‚Äôll do a head to head blind of ER and WJ. Probably wouldn‚Äôt matter because I could easily pick those two out of a single blind matchup. I‚Äôll be honest, eagle rare is not my favorite but it obviously has a much better value."
What is the absolute greatest Irish whiskey you‚Äôve ever had? Has anyone tried Method & Madness 28 ruby?,"I come from a Scotch background, but the last couple of years have been venturing into various malternatives and whiskies from other regions, not least Ireland. I so regret not getting some of the amazing The Whisky Agency late-80‚Äôs/early-90‚Äôs Irish whiskies when they were available in my market, as those seem to be universally held in extremely high regard. I‚Äôm really interested in exploring the higher echelons of Irish, in particular things like old (in age) Teeling single casks, Red Breast single/dream casks, some old Bushmills, and some Midleton products, not least the Method & Madness 28 year ruby port, which is eye-watering expensive, but also greatly intrigues me. Wondering if anyone here has had that and can comment- only a handful of reviews; looking for more. 
Irish brands seem really tapped into the want for hyper-luxury whiskies, and you see it manifested in the packaging for their premium/ultra-premium offerings, which I think are actually done rather tastefully, but I‚Äôd much rather do without the associated cost and just have a plain bottle with the best liquid. 
Anyways, curious what your all-time favourite/greatest Irish whiskies are!","I‚Äôve had just about all of the variations of greenspot and redbreast, and have had a select few other Irish whiskies. Hands down the most magical pour is the Redbreast 27. I am baby sitting the bottle on my shelf as I don‚Äôt ever want to run out of it.
I‚Äôm a fan of the entire redbreast line, 21 and 27 are delicious, I prefer them over MVR Barry crocket and Jameson 18. Red spot has a fruity profile similar to redbreast. I think I‚Äôve only had the higher age whiskies of midleton.

RB12 is a great lower price Irish, powers johns lane used to be good, haven‚Äôt had it since their repackaging tho.
Teeling. Flew to Dublin as part of my honeymoon and went for a run one day. After jogging through St Patrick's cathedral I went over to this little distillery on the west side. Had my fanny pack with credit card, phone, and ID looking cool as a cucumber covered in a combination of sweat and rain. Walker in and asked if I could just do a tasting. They said the last tour was ending and I could just hop in for a tasting. My understanding of accents isn't that good so that was my interpretation.

Loved it! The Irish Whiskey Museum in Dublin taught me to always drink it neat. Been buying it ever since at my local Specs and got a few buddies into it.
My favorite easy to find Irish is Red Spot or Redbreast Lustau, but my personal favorite for special occasions is the Redbreast All Sherry Single Cask which iirc spends its entire aging process in a Sherry butt. I have a 19 year and a 25 year, both of which I found at the Dublin airport duty free shop. They take you on a 15 second flavor journey with each sip.
Bushmills Millenium Malt.
Redbreast cask strength, but for a slightly more affordable dram I like Greenspot
Waterford single farm origin has been pretty amazing...I feel like the nuances in the flavor they're going for really come through.
For me it's the first Redbreast Dream Cask. All the juicy fruit with more maturity. The late 80s-early 90s distilled bottles from TWA and similar labels that I have tried are all incredible too, although the more recent bottlings haven't been quite as good as earlier. From what I've heard the comparable Teeling bottles are just as good as those from TWA. Haven't tried any of the high end Method & Madness.
A 16 year old Cooley single cask from AD Rattray, but I had to dilute it down to 46% to get the most out of it.

I can copy paste this exactly except for it sitting in my closet and it isn't even in the whiskey cabinet
I'm not an Irish Whisky fan, but I got to try some 27 and it was really good. https://i.imgur.com/QqxPmxW.jpg
Jameson 18 is so disappointing tbh"
Can‚Äôt wait to try,,Pretty good pour
Did I get scammed?,"Recently I've purchased a very specific Whiskey that I can only find available in TX on 2 sites, one of them being Seelbachs. I had no Idea they had such a bad rep til after purchase. (I know I messed up) 

I'm just wondering if at the very least I will receive the whiskey I paid for and not some refilled bottle or knock off of some kind. Pic of whiskey I'm trying to buy included below. 

If anyone has purchased from the site recently or knows about their trustworthiness please let me know.

As far as I know, the only complaint that people have with them is that shipping can take 15 days to a month. I‚Äôve ordered from them in the past and had no problem with my order and have just placed another order from them and am certain it will again arrive within a month. 

Your mistake is ordering 200ml of 2 year old whiskey with beaver ass juice in it for 70$. That‚Äôs insane. Why on earth would anyone order this???? Beaver ass juice?!?!?!? Whyyyyy put that into a whiskey. But lucky for you, your beaver ass juice is most definitely on the way.
Seelbachs certainly isn‚Äôt a scam site.
You scammed yourself by spending $60 on 200ml of 88 proof whiskey imo
Seelbach‚Äôs is a very legitimate website. If shipping is taking a while just shoot them an email. I got a response same day and it was shipped out the next day
From what I‚Äôve heard they have a decent rep in a local bourbon group but I had two bad experiences in a row and will not order from them again. 

My first order I don‚Äôt remember the details but I had a ‚Äòfirst time customer order discount‚Äô code, put in the order and it got cancelled as out of stock. A few days later it was back available but my code showed as used so I skipped the order. My second order was a tamworth gin a year or so ago (Tamworth Garden Barrel Reserve Flora Gin). Produced in my home state. I can‚Äôt remember the details exactly but tracking showed no progress for a couple weeks so I called and they cancelled the order and refunded my money. 

Their customer service is always very cordial but there have been enough issues I won‚Äôt do business with them.
I‚Äôve ordered multiple times from seelbachs.  One time they oversold their stock and made up for it.  You will be fine
They‚Äôre reputable it just takes a while to ship in my experience. 

Last month I purchased multiple bottles for colleagues and some were delivered last week, others haven‚Äôt even shipped yet.
Rofl, I read your comment thinking ""wow man don't need to get on OP so hard and call it beaver ass juice..."" then I read the description... Holy shit its actually Beaver ass juice...
Lmaooo, Its a gift for a friend. Hes a big whiskey guy and I learned about this ""Beaver ass Juice"" and thought he might like a taste.
Some crazy French flavoring here. The more I think about it though, the more I want a taste of leathered, beaver ass juice!"
Getting The Ol‚Äô Feet Wet,"Been a long time amateur consumer of smokey Scotch before but my taste lately has been switching into Bourbons (mainly Makers 46, Eagle Rare and Woodford). I have been wanting to step out of the comfort zone lately and find smaller brands to pit against the larger Goliath‚Äôs of the game and came across this newcomer and decided to give it a shot. 

I was very surprised by this one in particular (it looks like its only available in Europe currently). The nose carries Banana peel, caramel and dough notes and although sweet it is quite dialed back compared to Makers Mark. The pallet kept quite true to the nose as well with the caramel points taking the spot light. Very surprised with its 45%abv. Very highly recommended: Juvenis Bourbon.

Can anyone here recommend more of these smaller independent distilleries to try? Thanks!",
Review #1: Kavalan Solist Moscatel Finish,"Review #1 Kavalan Solist Moscatel Finish

Hi all, long-time lurker and this is my first review post.

Happy holidays, r/whiskey!

I‚Äôve had a variety of scotch, bourbon and whiskey and this is the first bottle that has compelled me to try my hand at a review. 

What I‚Äôve tried: 

Scotch:
- Bunnahabin 12
- Glenfiddich 12
- Glenlivet 12
- Oban 12
- Tomatin 12 / 14 / 18
- Johnnie Walker Black

Japanese Whiskey:
- Hibiki Harmony
- Takeretsu Single Malt
- Nikka From the Barrel
- Nikka Yoichi
- Suntory Ao

Taiwan Whiskey:
- Kavalan Solist Moscatel Finish

Bourbon:
- Buffalo Trace
- Eagle Rare
- Woodford Reserve Double Oaked
- Michter‚Äôs Small Batch

Irish:
- Sexton Single Malt

Cracked this open to celebrate both Christmas and my dad‚Äôs birthday. Shared with my dad & brother. Comes in a beautiful wood display box.  

Kavalan Solist Moscatel Finish Single Cask Strength. Taiwan single malt. 56.3% ABV. No colour added, Non-chill filtered.

Price paid: $7,800 NTD (approx $333 CAD / 252 USD)

Maturation: No age statement. Matured in Spanish Moscatel Sherry cask.

Served: Neat, in a glencairn.

Nose: Drizzled honey, white grape, jammy fruits, floral, touch of toffee & chocolate. I could nose this forever.

Palate: The nose transitions very well to the palate. Silky smooth & slightly creamy texture. The drizzled honey becomes honey castella (more condensed) while the other notes of white grape, jammy fruits, floral, touch of toffee & chocolate transition over.

Finish: Medium-long. The honey darkens and becomes more like brown sugar. The floral & jammy fruits remain but are lighter and transition into a heavier chocolate note.

Comments: This is amazing. I‚Äôll be honest - most scotch/bourbon/whiskey that I‚Äôve had, I can nose/taste 2-3 notes at most. With this, there is an absolute explosion of flavours that meld fantastically. Well-balanced. A dessert whiskey on the sweeter side. 

Final score: 94

Rating Scale:

0-49: Blech. ()

50-59: Save it for mixing. (Crown Royale)

60-69: Not so good. I might not turn down a glass if I needed a drink. (Michter‚Äôs Small Batch)

70-74: Meh. It‚Äôs definitely drinkable, but it can do better. (Buffalo Trace, Eagle Rare, Sexton Single Malt, Tomatin 12, Suntory Ao)

75-79: Decent whisky worth tasting. Happy I tried it but wouldn‚Äôt pick up a 2nd bottle. (Johnnie Walker Black, Tomatin 14, Nikka Yoichi, Nikka From the Barrel, Glenlivet 12, Glenfiddich 12)

80-84: Quite good. Quality stuff. I‚Äôd consider buying a 2nd bottle at MRSP. (Bunnahabin 12, Oban 12, Hibiki Harmony, Takeretsu Single Malt, Woodford Reserve Double Oaked)

85-89: Excellent, a standout dram. Would definitely buy at MRSP if I can. (Tomatin 18)

90-94: Sublime, a personal favourite in its category. (Kavalan Solist Moscatel Finish)

95-100: As good as it gets. Jaw-dropping, eye-widening, unforgettable whisky. ()

My rating scale is based purely on flavour experience, and does not take value-for-money into account. Cheers!","Good share, moscatel is special indeed!"
Been a good night,Not included is the scotch from this afternoon (lagavuling distillers edition and Offerman),
Not a bad gift,,"This bottle is bad ass I love it

Bookers Blind tasting (review),"Whiskey:

Bookers 2023-02 ‚ÄúApprentice Batch‚Äù 2023-02
Age 7 yrs 1 month 2 days, proof 125.5  

Bookers 2023-03 ‚ÄúMighty Fine Batch‚Äù 2023-03
Age 7 yrs 1 month 2 days, proof 126.6

Despite having my GF blind pour these I could pretty much tell which was which upon tasting. But I still ran with the blind tasting nonetheless.

Nose

 The noses were essentially equal. Ever so slight differences, but not enough to distinguish one from the other. 2023-03 stood out slightly more as it had a stronger ethanol presence on the nose (bigger burn lol). But note wise neither had anything particularly unique.

Palette/Finish (Neat)

Palette was a different story entirely. Glass 1 ended up being the Apprentice batch. A caramel Bomb followed by heavy oak bitterness that was borderline sourness. For me the bitter/sour oak wasn‚Äôt off putting. But I understand why this batch is so divisive. It‚Äôs not for everybody. But it lacks balance as it really is a tail of two extremes. There‚Äôs no smoothness in the transition either. Just as your enjoying the heavy caramel/butterscotch flavors it abruptly turns to the bitter/sourness. It can be quite jarring. Finish was long

Glass 2 to was obviously the Mighty fine batch. It was more rounded. No jarring flavor shifts. Starts off with nondescript general sweetness and a creamy mouth feel. Balanced out by a gradual transition to a present but not punchy oakiness. however the finish grape, almost wine like. Neat I give the edge to glass two as the balance and roundness is far less jarring and the flavor is more complex but pleasant.

Palette/Finish (water)

Glass 1 with water was wildly different. The caramel is still there but it falls to the back just a bit and the oak bitterness is drastically toned down. I wouldn‚Äôt say the transition from sweetness to bitter is smoother, I would say there almost isn‚Äôt a transition at all so much as they become one. As a whole I could describe the profile as grape nerds as all the flavors come together.

Glass 2  became more complex with water as I was more able to distinguish the muddled flavors. First comes a heavy peanut flavors. Kind of like maple flavored peanuts. Right behind it is a heavy vanilla cream. Ethanol heavy with slight grape note on the finish. With water I give the edge to glass 1. Glass 2 was still very good with water however I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the peanut note which becomes dominant with a few drops of water. And the candy like nerds palette of glass one just becomes much more preferable to me

I‚Äôd say for my pallets both bottles at retail are buys however if you‚Äôre very sensitive to oak or bitterness it may be best to avoid  2023-02 apprentice batch. I came to a draw in terms of which I think is better as I preferred Mighty Fine Batch near but Apprentice Batch with water.

I‚Äôd give both 7.8/10","How long has Apprentice been opened for compared to Mighty Fine (looks at least close to a fresh crack)? Would be curious to see how these stack up after some time open for Mighty Fine.
Considerably longer. The AB has been for about 2 months vs the MF which is a fresh crack. So I‚Äôm likely going to do another blind down the road. IMO that‚Äôs where the heavy ethanol in the nose and finish are coming from. But the flavors on the AB are essentially exactly the same as when I opened it a few months ago. So I truthfully don‚Äôt think much will change. But time will tell."

Flaviar Review - Costco ($125) vs Website ($250) Box Comparison," First of all, let me just say i've been having a grand time tasting the whiskeys from my Flaviar box. My wife bought it for me from the Flaviar website as an early Christmast gift, and it's a lot of fun, there are some great whiskeys in here. So you can imagine my excitement when I went shopping with the family at Costco and saw ANOTHER Flaviar Advent Calendar whiskey tasting box - at half the price!

Needless to say, my wife and I were initially shocked and disappointed to learn that there we could have bought the same product much cheaper ($125 at Costco - and it was on sale for $100 - vs $250 online). I tried to console her by taking a closer look at the box, and noted that the box was different. Surely, the Costco version had a different selection - and a much cheaper one too right?

When we went home to do some research on whether or not to buy the version from Costco, we found it infuriatingly hard to get the list of whiskeys and understand the difference between the Costco version and the Website version. I had seen a few similar posts about others being confused, or feeling duped that they could have bought the advent calendar at Costco for much cheaper, and was astonished that I could not find a full list of the whiskeys in either box anywhere online.

Was Flaviar really ripping us off? We e-mailed customer service to find out, and Flaviar graciously responded by providing us a full whiskey list to compare the differences between the two boxes (props to Flaviar for excellent customer service).

Verdict? Yes the two boxes are different, however which one is a better bang for yor buck? I took an hour to research and google the prices for all 48 whiskeys and here are the takeaways:

1. There are no duplicates between the boxes (although some of the selection is very similar)
2. The average value of whiskeys from the online box was $66 vs $50 for the Costco box
3. The online box comes with \*2\* Flaviar Whiskey Glasses vs only \*1\* from the Costco box
4. Even after adding up the difference of 1 extra glass online, and the higher average value of whiskey, the Costco version is a better bang-for-your buck

Overall, I highly recommend you purchase the Costco version of the box if you have an opportunity to. It is a much better bang-for-your-buck when you consider that the value of the whiskeys from the Costco version need to be roughly half of the online version for the two offerings to comparable. However that is not the case, and the online selection only offers a marginally higher quality of whiskey vs the Costco version.

I wish Flaviar would be more transparent about the list from both boxes, so i've also open-sourced the whiskey list from both boxes in a googlespreadsheet here for any interested in comparing the differences between the two boxes:

DIY Whiskey Advent Calendar,"Earlier this year my husband was telling me about a whiskey Advent calendar he saw. He was interested, but it was a bit out of his price range, so I decided to do a DIY version as a gift to him. His interest in whiskey is relatively new, so there's a lot of things he hasn't tried, so my goal in doing this was to let him try many different whiskies and see what he likes (or doesn't). I am not a whiskey drinker myself, so I had to outsource for literally all of it. I wanted to say a special thank you to this subreddit, I heavily relied on the pinned gift guide and a number of other posts when I was in the planning phase. I also got recommendations from his friends and half a dozen liquor store employees but this sub was so instrumental in me doing this, I thought I'd share what I ended up doing!

Here's an explanation of what you're looking at:

On the calendar each day was marked with a color. Blue is ""accessories"", green is shooters, yellow was intended to be midsized bottles but ended up being midsized or cheaper large bottles, and red is more ""expensive"" full sized bottles. My goal price point for the expensive bottles was around $50, I know this isn't necessarily expensive in the grand scheme of whiskey, but that's about what I could manage this year.

The shooters ended up being pretty much one of each standard liquor store shooter. Highlights for him included the Tullamore Dew and the Wild Turkey. Some of these, like Skrewball, he had tried before and knew he liked. The fireball was mostly just a joke (he actually got that one today!). I left them all in a bag and had him draw one at random on the shooter days.

The midsize/cheaper bottles were more of a challenge for me. The Elijah Craig and Bulleit were recommended either from this sub or from his friends. The Sheep Dog I picked myself because I knew he likes Skrewball and thought since he'd be getting a shooter of that, maybe he could try another brand. The other two he actually chose himself. I made an irl sticky note calendar to match the Excel sheet so he knows what's coming when, and since I was out of ideas we went shopping together.

The big bottles were all recommendations from his friends. They also drink whiskey, often together, so I figured they would have insight on his preferences and suggest accordingly. I ended up with these three and spread them out for the beginning, middle (but on a weekend), and end of the calendar in ascending price order.

The specific accessories were:
[Whiskey Log Journal ](https://www.33books.com/collections/books/products/33-whiskeys) he loves small journals, so this was a no brainer for me. I wanted to give this to him on day one but I did not order it in time

They are DIFFICULT to fill.
[Salted Whiskey Caramels ](https://ahealthylifeforme.com/salted-whiskey-caramels/) I like baking so I used this recipe, I definitely burned them, but he insists they're edible. I used Tin Cup, which was a bottle he already had in the house, I didn't need too much so I didn't think he'd notice if I used it (he did notice). I definitely should've done a practice run of these, but at least it gave me an excuse to buy a candy thermometer.

[Travel Flight ](https://agedandore.com/collections/featured/products/bottle-flight) we camp often, and he likes to share things with his friends, so I thought this would be good

I floated some other ideas for the actual Christmas Day gift he didn't seem to keen on, and eventually I settled on this.

I know we're not all the way through it, husband isn't on Reddit so I'm not super worried about him stumbling across it. I really appreciate all of the posts and gift guides on this sub. I truly cannot express just how helpful this was for me as someone who knows literally nothing about whiskey. I had a lot of fun with this and I think my husband has too so far! I'm looking forward to the last weekish. Any recommendations for other bottles or accessories are welcome too because there will always be future birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays.

Review: Writers Tears Japanese Cask Finish,"Now, I'm a big fan of these writers tears cask finishes- I've had the read head and ice win cask bottles, and love them both.

My fiance and I both had and loved Kaiyo Mizunara Cask Strength, those delightful honey and wood notes so subtle on the pallet. 

So when I saw this, I knew I had to pull the trigger, even at $169, which is the most I've spent on a bottle so far.

I don't know how old this juice is or how long it was finished, but it's bottled at cask strength, which is 110 proof in this case.

The whiskey was tasted neat from a glencair after sitting 10 minutes.

Nose: The nose I get off of this is *exactly* like those little hard banana candies from my childhood. I haven't had them in years, and taking a whiff of this dram really was a nostalgia trip. Behind that is a little honey and a little bit of candy apple, but that candy banana notes really makes up 90%+ of the nose I get from this.

Pallet: The front of the pallet here is honey, backed by clove and allspice. I'm not skilled enough to pull much more from it than that. It drinks quite warm, but not in a way that strikes me as harsh. I feel like it would've benefited from another year or two in the cask to mellow out the burn just a touch, but that can come down to personal preference. 

Texture: This is one of the most luxurious textures I think I've had short of my 126.6 proof Bookers. It's not quite syrupy, but coats the mouth really well and sticks around. The proof and stickiness is enough to leave the mouth with a numb tingly feel like few other whiskeys I've had, even in this proof range.

Finish: The candy bananas from the nose really come back with a vengeance on the finish. The flavors stick around for maybe 4 or 5 seconds, but the subtle warmth sticks around much longer.

Overall: 7.8/10 - This was good, I really enjoy it. If you like honey-forward Japanese whiskys, you'll probably enjoy this. I personally prefer Kaiyo for the Mizunara Cask flavors, as I don't get much woodiness on this, however the influence really shows in the banana nose and finish and the honey-forward pallet. This was a very enjoyable experience, but ultimately just okay for the price. I'd rather buy two bottles of Kaiyo Mizunara Cask Strength over getting this again, and the price where I live works out nearly the same. That's not to say this is a bad bottle, and I don't regret this purchase- but I feel like a $100-$120 price range would have been more suiting. However, if you like banana notes, it could very well be worth the extra cash.",
This is damn fine bourbon,Decided to give this 9yr old mgp from Old Soul and its God damn delicious. Quite viscous and buttery mouth feel. Smells like Toffee and butterscotch. Taste has notes of peaches rubbed with spicy cinnamon and a chocolate note at the end. Only con is the price at 160$ which is preventing me from giving it a solid 9/10. Old Soul you did a helluva job with this but yall need to work on that price.,"This bottle is such an egregious cash grab from a (primarily) vodka distillery.. won't be purchasing any more of their products if that's the way they wish to play it going forward.  For what it's worth I thought the Series 1 was good, but even it was overpriced at $100.
Forget the tin types, just go for the blue label uncut/unfiltered. I‚Äôm in MS so theres store picks of it everywhere but even outside it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to find around $60.  It‚Äôs usually cask strength around 120 proof and damn good. I‚Äôve had the tin type #1 and #2 and the only discernible difference is the fancier label, and it‚Äôs got a higher age statement but it‚Äôs not worth an extra $100.
It's definitely a cash grab which is becoming the usual sadly...nonetheless it's good juice..cheers"
I'm dreaming of a whiskey Christmas! üéÑ,"With Christmas on my mind, I decided to try putting some whiskey in eggnog!

I chose Arran's Amarone Cask Finish because I felt the cinnamon notes I taste in that could be nice. I added about 1.5 oz of the scotch to the glass over ice, poured in eggnog and dusted it with cinnamon.

The resulting drink is quite nice. The scotch and eggnog come together really well. But the flavour, while very pleasant, is subtle relative to what I tried next...

My parents requested eggnogs as well, and for them I tried making the drinks using Mitchner's US-1 bourbon. I just had to take a teaspoon and sample one, though! 

The oakiness and vanilla notes of the bourbon come through in a much more intense way.

I think I prefer the Mitchner's overall used with eggnog, but both are very nice.

If I don't post again before Christmas, I hope you all have very merry Christmases! I hope you all get to enjoy some drams with friends and family.","A wine cask finished scotch is definitely an interesting choice to add to eggnog!
It worked imo. It might not have been the best choice, but it was an interesting result"
Any info on this?,Inherited from my grandfather. It‚Äôll keep getting passed down but want to give my son some context.,"Looks like a spring cap which is ~1950s, and there looks like a US tax strip which should help you date it within a period as well.

Noah‚Äôs Mill tastes like soil,"I don‚Äôt mean this as a bad thing. I‚Äôm not sure if I mean it as a good thing either? I got this as a going away gift and it‚Äôs unlike anything else I‚Äôve tasted. My girlfriend was the one who pointed out the prominent earthy chemically soil note that is heavy on the finish. Does anyone else have this batch and know what I‚Äôm talking about, or is this a bad bottle maybe?","‚ÄúEarthy‚Äù is a common tasting note for this.
Tried it, it‚Äôs not my cup of tea. Different.
I miss when it was about 15 bucks cheaper a couple years ago.
Oooo I love earthy flavors.
I thought it tasted like a bad white wine, least favorite bottle.
I like Noah‚Äôs.
I thought it was just awful
It very well could be a Willett thing too, because I‚Äôve never had any Willett other than the Pot Still
Noah's Mill is super heavy on the oak, which can be a turn off for some.  A lot of people hate EC 18 for the same reason.    I would give Rowan's Creek a try instead, much sweeter less oaky profile.
Another fan here. Really enjoy sipping on it around a fire, sometimes with a cigar. Found that smoke compliments the earthy notes.
It has a weird cinnamon red hot note that I don‚Äôt love. I get the same thing with all Willett products, even the ‚ÄúPurple Tops.‚Äù I don‚Äôt understand the hype.
I‚Äôve just opened this and it tastes mouldy. Like the barrel was mouldy.¬†
I actually really like it, been trying to find it locally and it‚Äôs nowhere to be seen anymore..
I was wondering if I got a bad bottle this year‚Ä¶it‚Äôs got a nice nose and starts with a really nice sweet note and finishes like a mouthful of dirt. No oak to be found. Willett Rye has a nice earthy undertone. Noah‚Äôs is dirt.
And Rowan‚Äôs creek taste like creek water
Love Noah's Mill. Perfect rainy day whiskey since it tastes like.... rain lol.
I searched the internet to see if anyone else had the same feeling I did about this and I stumbled across this post. I just bought batch 23-02 and it‚Äôs one of the worst bourbon‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever had. It tastes like moldy dirt. I couldn‚Äôt agree with you more. This is NOT typical of Noah‚Äôs Mill. I love bourbon and I‚Äôve had multiple bottles of Noah‚Äôs Mill over the years, likely while they were still sourcing it from MGP. But I think in 2022 they started releasing their own distilled product‚Ä¶. unfortunately it‚Äôs not good. If this is the future of Noah‚Äôs Mill, its future is not bright and will not be long lasting.
It tastes minerally and chemically to me. Like a bag of soil from Home Depot. Is that the type of earthy you get?
I know it‚Äôs an unpopular opinion around here, but I freaking love this stuff.
I‚Äôm getting some oak, but the after taste literally tastes like the garden section at Home Depot smells. It‚Äôs incredibly potent tasting. Slightly off putting but I don‚Äôt know if I hate it yet.
I mostly want to try another bottle to see if this finish is a one off or if that‚Äôs how they all taste. This one is divisive it seems, and I tend to be pretty open to anything I try and usually enjoy it, which makes me wonder if this is supposed to taste like this. Lol
I don‚Äôt think I dislike it yet. It was just a strong finish that I‚Äôve never had before.
That‚Äôs about in line with my experience.
I can definitely see what you mean.
Same batch, same story.  Worst bottle of bourbon I‚Äôve ever had, and felt compelled to see if anyone else had commented on this batch.  It‚Äôs undrinkable.
I definitely didn‚Äôt have that experience. Maybe this is a bad bottle. I remember more of a tobacco/raisin/spice finish.
I got the big earthy note in the first few weeks after I opened it. Now (months later) it's shifted to bigger caramel, butterscotch and vanilla notes
How did you drink it? For me, a whiskey that I don‚Äôt like can be changed over a single cube, and vice versa.
That is the traditional Willett profile for sure. They are known for their cinnamon and earthiness. 


My brother is a big peated scotch fan, Noahs Mill is one of the few bourbons he really enjoys, because of it's earthy finish
I‚Äôve only had pours from two different bottles/batches so far and they were pretty similar. Yours could be an outlier as I wouldn‚Äôt describe it as chemical at all, but it‚Äôs hard to say.
Yeah it might be. I am trying it with water right now to see if that changes anything.
I've had this exact batch and it was one of the better Noah Mills upon cracking


Most NM take a month or two to really open up, the one I had fresh cracked like it had been open for 6 months. Definitely has the traditional earthy Willett profile but was much more viscous and cherry forward than I was used too.
I always try it first neat and then I‚Äôll add water to see if it changes. I‚Äôll usually do rocks when I‚Äôm not actively tasting the whiskey.
Have you ever walked into the outdoor gardening section at Home Depot? The air is thick with bags of soil and fertilizer. That‚Äôs exactly how it tastes. So I figure it must be a bad bottle maybe.
You‚Äôre not the first person to say to let it open up so I‚Äôm going to revisit it in a little while and see if anything changes."
I hate JD ryes,"I hate Jack Daniel‚Äôs ryes. There. I said it. 

I was super excited when I picked up a single barrel barrel strength over the summer, but when I tasted it all I could taste was this dark flavor that I absolutely can not stand. It reminds me of a Madeira finished single malt that I‚Äôve had for years because I despise this one particular flavor. 

But I didn‚Äôt want to give up on JD ryes altogether because I‚Äôve heard so many good things about them and, being a single barrel I chalked it up to that I had just gotten a bad barrel. But today I picked up a triple mash at one of the drops and just tasted it and it has that flavor that I really dislike and I‚Äôm really disappointed. It‚Äôs less prominent than in the SBBP but it‚Äôs still there and now that I‚Äôve tasted it it‚Äôs all I can taste. 

So do I just hate all JD ryes? And to clarify there are other ryes out there that I like so it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like ryes. Does anyone else pick up on this note too or is it just me? What am I missing?","You are the first to say they didn‚Äôt like it that I‚Äôve seen. I always see 8,9,10 out of 10s for reviews on it. I have a 138 proofer bottle of it myself, it‚Äôs my favorite rye I‚Äôve had and I don‚Äôt love ryes. Everyone‚Äôs palate is different. 

People love Amburana finished bourbons and I think they taste as if a young bourbon had a cinnamon stick aged in it for a few months then threw in some weird chemical flavor. It tastes artificial to me. Other people love them.
 
Sometimes you have to sort out the hype for yourself.
For the fans of JD Rye we thank you
More for me!
I think I know what dark flavor you might be talking about. I just tried the bonded rye and it has a flavor that strongly reminds me of a honey hard candy and I like it, but everyone's palate is different
Its okay. I‚Äôve tried a few of their offerings and I think that for me, I just do not like their mash profile or process. I respect what they‚Äôre doing, but I do not enjoy their flavor profile.
I don‚Äôt hate JD, but all their whiskey has that ‚ÄúJD flavor‚Äù (often described as ‚Äúbananas‚Äù, I presume from their yeast) that I just don‚Äôt like very much. I can tell the SBBP (bourbon and rye both) are well-made and objectively good, but they are never the first thing I reach for when I‚Äôm pouring myself a drink. Rye makes a good Manhattan, though.
I've tried a couple of their ryes and it tastes just JD enough to remind me of the dozens of times I threw it up in college lol. That's totally on me, but it's kind of ruined all of JD for me
I'm not a fan either. My bottle is ok, but I won't get another, so more for all you JDSBBPR fanatics. The bourbon is excellent tho.
I‚Ä¶don‚Äôt care for the bonded rye. The single barrel rye is good, but i actually passed on one of the SBBP Ryes because there were others at lesser price I‚Äôd rather try and buy.
I just opened a SBBS Rye for the first time a few weeks ago and was surprised with the unique flavors. But after 3-4 pours, I do love it. It gives such a unique flavor. Not quite like a rye, not like a bourbon. It's got its own thing going and thats what makes it worth having for anyone that likes variety.
I hear the hazmat SiB BP for JD rye is where it‚Äôs at. The sub 130 I have is good but nothing crazy.
I just picked up the Bonded Rye and really like it.  Full and punchy.  I also like the SBBP but am not a fan of the single barrel rye.
If it's not your jam, it's not your jam. No hate. I didn't care for the triple mash, but the JD sbbp rye I loved for the price. The barrel proof whiskey was better, but the rye was totally up my alley
This.
I don‚Äôt hate JD. Just their ryes. I love their SBBP   Tennessee whiskey and am on the hunt for a 10 and 12
I agree"
Tested some bottles I‚Äôve seen on/had recommended by this sub,"My cocktail ingredients are oriented towards bourbon right now, so the Woodford Reserve has been my primary for the last week (I may have made my cocktail a bit too strong last night in celebration). Tasted the Mellow Corn and the Michter‚Äôs before I drank anything to get a clear idea. The Michter‚Äôs was recommended by the sub, the other two I had seen in some posts and decided to try out. My thoughts:

The Woodford Reserve Double Oaked is phenomenal for cocktails. The char test is very very forward on it, but not overpoweringly sickening and unbalanced like I find Old No. 7 to be. If you like char forward whiskey, it‚Äôs definitely a sipper. If not, the char taste remains strong even in more ingredient heavy cocktails and allows the quality of the whiskey to shine through. 8/10 keep a bottle on the shelf.

I was worried about the Mellow Corn as people seem to either love it or hate it. I found it to be surprisingly smooth for how hot it was at 100 proof. The heat IMO stops it from being a sipper, as I would have to dilute it too much with water. It‚Äôs a good shooter though, goes down smooth and puts a fire in your belly. I‚Äôm sure it will compliment some cocktails, but I don‚Äôt see it adding much in the way of flavor. 7/10 because it was only $20, a good whiskey to bring for a party or if you wanna get some bang for your buck.

The Michter‚Äôs US 1 was exactly what I, a rye newbie, was looking for. The char test is present but far behind the spice flavor of the mash bill. It is complex, and I‚Äôm excited to experiment with it in cocktails. It makes a good sipper too, though I personally need to water it a little. I wouldn‚Äôt shoot it, you‚Äôd be missing out. 8/10 will be keeping one around.


A note on my scoring: 10/10 is for things that taste indulgently good, but are more situational or too expensive to be a regular drinker for most people. 9/10 is more like a traditional 10/10 and 8/10 is to me saying ‚Äúyou can afford to use this as one of your primary go-tos and you probably should‚Äù","MFC
The woodford DO is amazing. Over time you‚Äôll get accustomed to the higher proofs, i was like that up until like 7 months ago. Now i prefer a 110-115 proof!

If you want a budget bourbon, look no further than Evan Williams Bottled in Bond, its 15-20 bucks and super delicious
I LOVE the Michters Rye, it‚Äôs usually what I tell people to go for if they want to start getting into ryes. Can usually find it pretty easily and it‚Äôs good price

Don't care much for W12. To me, it's unbalanced and very oak forward. 

EC18 to me was pretty good. Considering its age, it actually retained its typical EC profile. I'm not sure why people are comparing C923 to the 18. Both are them are very different.
1. Weller Full Proof

4. Eagle Rare 

Everything else is stuff I can find pretty regularly in my area, like the fact they threw in a Sazerac Rye as if it‚Äôs something rare or even expensive is a little comical to me.  My absolute last pick would be the Elmer T, it‚Äôs a middle shelf bourbon that‚Äôs propped up by the demand for BT. I was very unimpressed by it personally.

Man, EC18 keeps getting left off, am I just mistaking older for possibly better?
Man, Weller is making some lists. I've only had the 12, the full proof that good? 
Have you tasted all on your list?
I'm imagining just overall perceived quality vs price, but we'll see what I have a choice of anyway, *if* my name is even drawn. ü§ûü§û
Weller that high, eh? There's a bar near me that charges like $26 for a pour of that. 

I declined. Haven't had it, but seemed crazy to charge half the bottle for a single pour.
Had all/any of them?
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Man, duly noted. Seems EC18 isn't high on many lists, so I'll try to not be too disappointed if I don't have it as an option. Shoot I might not get any lol.
Sazerac can be bought online for $30. It's a tasty bottle but you should prioritize the harder to find bottles. I'm not far from northern MI and see it semi-frequently.
That‚Äôs interesting, good luck!
The low proof makes it pretty boring.
Not a fan of it this year. C923 is what EC18 should have been and its half the price. Ive had the chance to purchase EC18 3 times now this year and passed. Everything else I never see and prefer it also. EHTBP is by far the best option here.

For sure get W12 or WFP over ER and saz
The EC 12yr was always better than the 18 in my opinion, and would still regather drink the NAS small batch than the 18.
As far as these options go, they would be top 5 for me. Never had that maker though. 

But there is a big gap for me between the top 3 and all the rest.
The Full Proof is awesome.
It‚Äôs personally my favorite Weller, at least from what I‚Äôve been able to try so far. Never gotten my hands on a Single Barrel or a CYPB, so I can‚Äôt speak to those, but between the Antique 107, the 12 and the BP I really enjoy the latter the most.

Just wish I could ever actually find it these days, wherever/whoever it‚Äôs getting allocated to in my area is very tight lipped about it.
I‚Äôve had all. The blantons sftb was from a few years ago but I had it last weekend. It was around 128.8 proof and smelled like pineapple and did not drink that high of a proof. Being single barrel it‚Äôs hit or miss. I really like wheated bourbons, which is why I‚Äôd personally go for the weller and makers. The Taylor is also great. I hate liking buffalo trace because it‚Äôs so hard to find and I feel like they love that the secondary for their products is so crazy, but their stuff is too good to avoid out of principle.

Edit: the makers is very oaky. But if you put EC18 on your list, you might like it. But it‚Äôs not for everyone.
Assuming that is Cellar Aged, that would be my first pick. If its just some random Store Pick then it goes way down the list

Blanton's SFTB

Stagg

Elmer T Lee

Weller FP

Weller 12 

Weller SR (but only because it is hard to find around me)

Blanton's .375 (never seen one of the little ones)

Pass on everything else 

(EDIT) Didn't see the EHT was the Barrel Proof. That would be #2
Im in the tri-state and my Sams club has full shelves at like 26 bucks.
Noted. Ill have to keep hunting for a store that gets some rarer stock. There's some that do barrel picks and have plenty of the usual suspects, but ECBP and the like would be nice to have available
That's sounds pretty interesting out of that Blanton's. Agreed for the distillery overall, I'm probably going to grab one of their bottles of regular BT at $28 while I'm there bc I don't think I've seen it at MSRP for years. I'm happily surprised to have found this sort of hidden gem in my town, everything is state minimum and they have a pretty varied selection. 
And they apparently have a reputation for good sandwiches and stuff too so now I might have to get lunch there now and again.
Yep every area is different. Here in the midwest I can find ECBP, Larceny BP, Basic BT, and WSR easily but everything else is a bitch.
Good deal. I‚Äôm personally not a huge fan of regular BT. I‚Äôve bought a few bottles each fall, one to keep and a few to gift. Each year it smells like baking spices like vanilla and nutmeg. Smells like egg nog. And I hate nutmeg. But that‚Äôs not to say you shouldn‚Äôt buy it. Even if you don‚Äôt like it, most people will be happy to drink it when they come over. And I‚Äôm a sucker for a liquor store with food. We have a liquor store by me that does bbq and it‚Äôs pretty good for being made in the parking lot of a liquor store on a trailer mounted smoker. Whatever you get, I hope you enjoy it.
Thanks. ü§û For options, but I'm sure I'll enjoy what's left if I'm a late pick, bc I haven't really had a whiskey I didn't enjoy at least a little, and love trying new stuff so.. win"
"What are some inexpensive, yet good whiskeys to enjoy for a beginner?","Hi, so lately I‚Äôve been getting into some whiskey. I am not used to drinking whiskey, being a beer enjoyer, however I hate how beer makes you bloated (and I‚Äôve heard it increases estrogen, idk if thats true), so I have tried some whiskeys. I usually drink them straight or with ice if it‚Äôs too harsh.
A few I have tried are:
Jamesons - was pretty okay
Tullamore dew - enjoyed this one the most out of all that I have tried
Johnny Walker Red Label - it was disguisting, very harsh, burning, tried making some gold rush cocktails with it, couldnt drink it even then.
Jack Daniels - it‚Äôs I guess okay, was nothing special, have tried it a bunch of times.
Ballentines - this one is also disguisting for me, bad memories as well.

I have yet to find my go-to whiskey and probably a lot to try, still. I am looking for some recommendations, as I am a beginner I‚Äôd like something not too harsh and to train my pallette because I have not been able to smell or taste any notes from the whiskey as se of you can, like vanilla, banana or whatever the other notes can be. I‚Äôve heard old fashioned can be a great way to drink it as well, I‚Äôd like to try it as well.

However my choices can be quite limited as I am from Eastern Europe (yes, people usually, basically drink vodka and also beer as a substitute for coke here).

Edit: I am also still learning about whiskey and don‚Äôt know the taste and other differences between bourbon, scotch or irish whiskey, don‚Äôt know what type of malt, single malt or other specs exactly mean. I only know that Irish or bourbon is usually easier to drink, which is what I am looking for.","> as I am a beginner I‚Äôd like something not too harsh and to train my pallette

I'm a beginner more or less too, I've tried quite a few Japanese and Irish whiskies and lately have been getting into Bourbons.

For Japan, if you can find it I'd recommend [Suntory's Yamazaki single malt](https://distiller.com/spirits/yamazaki-12), it is made by a Japanese distiller Shinjiro Torii who sought to reinvent Scotch to appeal to a more delicate Japanese palate. Many Japanese whiskies are aged in a wood native to Japan called Mizunara (""water oak"") which adds a distinctive cedar/sandalwood note which is unique to Japan. Yamazaki 12 is usually $200 where I live so it might be pricey for you, if you can't find it I'd recommend Suntory [Hibiki Harmony](https://distiller.com/spirits/hibiki-japanese-harmony) or [Nikka From the Barrel](https://distiller.com/spirits/nikka-whisky-from-the-barrel) which are each cheaper and more attainable blends which also give you a great flavor of the Japanese style. Beware that there are a lot of fake ""Japanese whiskies"" trying to cash in on the Japanese whisky boom of the last 12 years or so, but Suntory and Nikka are the two legit big players (the ""Coke and Pepsi"" of Japanese whisky).

For Ireland, the big player is the Midleton distillery just east of Cork. They make Jameson, but also the Spot whiskies, Redbreast, and Method and Madness. Irish whiskies are unique in that they are traditionally made with half malted barley and half unmalted barley (an old strategy to avoid tax liability), which gives Irish whiskey its distinctive ""shortbread cookie"" note. If you like Jameson, I'd recommend trying any [Redbreast whisky](https://distiller.com/spirits/redbreast-12). The [Lustau Edition](https://distiller.com/spirits/redbreast-lustau-edition), finished in Bodegas Lustau Oroloso Sherry barrels, is my favorite, but all Redbreasts I've tried have been excellent.

For Bourbons, I'm pretty new to this space, but Bourbons are generally corn-dominant in their mashbills, and are traditionally aged in new charred wood barrels so all their flavor comes from the distillate and the wood, no finishing barrels (sherry, wine, etc) like many other world whiskies. The best ""bang for the buck"" in the Bourbon world I've tried so far is [Eagle Rare](https://distiller.com/spirits/eagle-rare-10-year), which is a 10 year old Bourbon made by Buffalo Trace and retails for $30-50. It has the red cherry fruit notes and is delicious especially for the price. [Jack Daniels Old No 7](https://distiller.com/spirits/jack-daniel-s-old-no-7) is probably the one you tried since that is their mass market product, but if you can find a [Jack Daniels Single Barrel Barrel Proof](https://distiller.com/spirits/jack-daniels-single-barrel-barrel-proof), that is a whole other animal for only around $65; usually at 60% ABV it has all the caramelized banana and maple notes while hiding its high proof very well.

Hopefully that helps you pick a couple to try.
Maker‚Äôs Mark if available, Tullamore Dew or Jameson for Irish
Try Glenfiddich 12 for a single malt scotch. It's one of, if not the best-selling single malt in the world. It is very approachable, drink it neat or with a small splash of water.
Buffalo Trace
Russell's Reserve 10 year is a great aged whiskey at a very reasonable price.
Try to find Glenmorangie 10 year Scotch. It should be reasonably easy to find, reasonably priced, and approachable. Orange and vanilla flavors and smoother than cheaper bourbons.
Weller Special Reserve,
If you can find it‚Ä¶..
The primary styles of whiskies are Scotch, Irish, Japanese, Canadian, and Bourbon/American. The first three are made primarily with barley. Canadian and American are made primarily with corn, often mixed with barley, rye, and/or wheat.  The percentage of grains is called the mashbill and generally determines differences in taste. Rye whiskey is also a popular American style, usually primarily rye with corn and barley as adjuncts.

Scotch varies based on the region where it's produced. The most famous style is from Islay, where they use peat as fuel for the grain-drying process. This produces a very smokey product. Highland styles are much cleaner and clearer. Irish and Japanese both tend to be straight forward barley whiskies. Canadian tend to have the fewest rules and is often a mixture of traditional corn whiskies with grain-neutral spirits.
Redbreast 12.
It's very much depending on what you consider inexpensive. Not all of us have a job at McDonald's. And if we did, not all of us could be regional manager.

But could I perhaps suggest looking got bottled that people think is a good introduction to that type or whiskey instead? While they wouldn't be the cheapest they should be bottles that will give you an insight on what the drink can be like.

If you think you would want to go down that direction then I would like to suggest Eagle Rare or Four Roses Single Barrel for bourbon. For Irish it would be Red Breast 12.

I'm not well versed in Japanse but I think that Nikka From The Barrel is a great one.

Scotch is still somewhat unknown territory for me.
Old Forester 86 proof, Buffalo Trace, Coopers Craft, Makers Mark, and Old Grandad Bonded are some of my favorite ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù and lower proof options."
Balcones Texas pot still bourbon,Just picked this up since I heard they are not doing bourbon anymore. I like this!

Ardbeg Corryvreckan- my favourite peaty whiskey,"This is my favourite peaty whiskey so far. 

I‚Äôm going to ditch the classic nose, palate, finish for this one. It deserves a full review. 

You immediately smell the peat. It hits you in the face. It‚Äôs like opening a bag of charcoal. Then sea spray comes along to drown you like the whirlpool tries many times, then charred wood, and, at the end, blackcurrants. 

And then, there‚Äôs the taste. WOW!! It‚Äôs like licking the bbq grill after a juicy heavily seasoned salt and pepper steak has been grilled to perfection on it, biting the steak and immediately taking a shot of pepper sauce to wash it down. Once you swallow, you snack on a piece of seaweed and light up your grandad‚Äôs cigar. 

The end is just never ending. I finished my shot an hour ago and I can still taste the bbq, the pepper, and on the tip of my tongue, espresso. 

At 57.1% ABV you expect alcohol burn at some point. Totally absent. It‚Äôs masterfully hidden behind the bold flavours. 

This should be in a museum. It‚Äôs a work of art.","Great review. Corryvreckan is one of my all time favorites. Cheers !
How does it compare to the regular 10yo? I've been looking to try either this one or the Uigeadail next.
Great description, it paints a lovely mental image. 

I like this and their Uigedail equally.  The Uigedail is more bacony savory sweet meat and the Corry is more black pepper and brine.
UPDATE: I left my glass until the morning. Still smelled of smoke and brine.
Thank yu!
If you find the 10yo to be too much, this is absolutely not for you. 

It‚Äôs the 10yo multiplied by a hundred peat wise. This is also much more flavourful and with many layers. 

I haven‚Äôt tried the Uigeadail, but from what I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs totally different as aged in sherry casks.
Thank you! How would you compare the two?"
My First Tasting! (Talisker 10),"Hey yall! This is my first real bottle (I‚Äôve mostly had black label and Makers) and I‚Äôm trying to train my palette! I‚Äôd love some feedback on the notes I‚Äôm picking up!

Nose:
- Peat and Smoke (a given)
- Strong apple peel
- Light ripe pear
- Sea spray, reminds me of Maine
- black pepper
- Slight pine on the breath out

Taste:
- Classic Islay Peat
- Black Pepper
- Salted caramel
- Slight dark fruits (cherry or something)
- Baking Spices? Definitely has a tingling/numbing effect on the edges of my tongue like clove or star anise
- long finish, but after a while I get a very cold, almost minty, close. The mintyness lingers for a long time and is super clean

Review:
I don‚Äôt have much comparison other than black label but it really is night and day. This is so clean and bright and refreshing, very coastal. I think the 10 years adds to that since it‚Äôs relatively young (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong I‚Äôm testing my knowledge). Super round a full flavor profile, I love the spice on the front that really smooths out as you hold it in your mouth. I won‚Äôt give it a numerical rating cause I have so little baseline, but I will 100% buy this again!","Was one of my first scotch tastings, if not my first. I still love it today.
My clan, the Mcleods, hail from the isle of skye. I picked this bottle up a few months ago for the name sake. I've tried it twice and out of the scotch ive tasted, it's a great option.
This bottle cost 140 dollars in my province lol
It‚Äôs very approachable, even as my first I think it would probably one I‚Äôd use to introduce people to scotch. Has a lot of neat notes and complexity without being too strong in more niche ways.
That‚Äôs super cool! Had a guy in r/scotch inform me that it‚Äôs not an Islay, like I thought it was, but it has similar properties because of the peat they use and some of the climate of the location it‚Äôs distilled and aged in. Interesting stuff.
Wowwww, yeah I got it on Christmas sale for $85. Still over MSRP but I figured it wasn‚Äôt too bad compared to what some scotch is selling for
It's ¬£32 on Amazon UK right now, but it'll be a 700ml bottle."
It was a Barrel Proof kind of day. Or Rickhouse proof? Thanks Missouri.,"As if we needed more confusion in the world of whiskey terminology, Missouri gives us ‚ÄúRickhouse proof.‚Äù

Thanks Missouri for the great pour and the further obfuscation of whiskey terms. 

Obligatory Reddit tasting reviews (yes, I cracked them when I got home):

Ben Holladay- This was a new one for me, but I‚Äôve wanted to try it, and I had never seen the ManBearPig Proof before. It‚Äôs really quite good. I get some dark red fruit on top of some brown sugar, and it drinks lower than its RicknMorty proof.

Bernheim- Another new one that I‚Äôd been craving (love a good wheater.) It‚Äôs great. Light fruit and floral honey, again drinks lower than its proof. Awesome whiskey.

WT Rare Breed- Everybody knows. It fucks. Turkey Gang Forever.",
What are they smelling and tasting??,"So I'm embarrassed to admit I've fallen down the YouTube rabbit hole a few times watching some of these bourbon reviews. Are they for real or is it for show?? I mean seriously. 

""I'm picking up chocolate, stone fruit, mashed bananas, cashews but unsalted cashews, double stuff oreo cookies, skittles, red peanut M&Ms, bite size not full size snickers, cr√®me br√ªl√©e, a left handed 20 year old baseball mit, a half smoked cigar, an overcooked hamburger"". 

I honestly don't get it. I smell and taste good or not so good bourbon. The only notes I have ever picked up are alcohol, oak, char, a little vanilla and a slight banana hint one time.","Use a glencairn glass where it‚Äôs fluted so you get more concentrated areas to smell. Swirl it around so you get the glass coated. Put your nose in the glass more, move the glass around so you get both nostrils. You‚Äôll eventually pick up smells better. I was the same way, I just smelled ethanol and traditional Carmel/vanilla/oak on everything. I enjoy bourbon much more when being able to smell it. Transfers over to the palate.

I will say some people are pulling stuff out of their ass when they give nosing notes.
What I do is take a pour, then look up reviews or distillery notes, and see if I can pick up anything that others do. Without a guide, all I can tell is if the nose is pleasant or not. I won‚Äôt move to a new bottle until I can discern 2 or more aromas. Take your time with it. It took me almost an entire bottle of JDSiB before I could finally detect the banana note.
Honestly it‚Äôs just something that clicks one day. I also have been down YouTube rabbit holes and hear all these random tasting notes. I have been drinking whiskey for several years and never got anything other than carmel/butterscotch, oak, and dirt/earthiness. Then one day at a whiskey tasting for Kentucky Owl it clicked, I got cherry, leather, Krazy glue (I think it‚Äôs the black magic marker some mention) then the same night after that tasting I had an Ezra Brooks bottle I poured  several times before and it suddenly was a total peanut butter bomb that I never noticed before. Since then it‚Äôs been more pronounced but I can‚Äôt say I pick up things 100% of the time
I used to think it was all bs too, whether it‚Äôs whiskey, cigars or wine. But then someone finally explained to me that ‚Äúnotes‚Äù are better described as things you are reminded of because of the flavors in your drink. This makes a lot of sense to me, bc while I love the flavors of all 3, I‚Äôve certainly never had a cigar that tasted like a ‚ÄúReese‚Äôs chocolate bomb‚Äù. Or bourbon that is a ‚Äúchocolate covered cherry bomb‚Äù. I have picked up notes of vanilla, caramel, fruit on bourbon for sure, but it still tastes like bourbon at the end of the day
Have you A-B tested anything? I‚Äôve found that helps a ton with picking out different notes because you taste things in one that you may not find in the other. This one is less exciting but it develops much more with time. After a while of intentionally tasting different things, the less the alcohol plays any factor in the taste and you start getting more in tune with different notes
There was an episode with the guys from the Whiskey Tribe/Vault where they had a brand ambassador from Glenfiddich on the show(I can't find the episode rn to give a link). During the episode the ambassador mentions that at one time they put a glass of their whiskey under an electronic/mechanical nose...the thing pulled out something like 300 different flavors/aromas. Thus validating the fact that there quite literally is no ""wrong answer"".  Smell associations (which is what this is) is simply memory recall. There's not actually bananas and caramel and white pepper in the glass..but something there is triggering a memory of those things. So, if you want to find more..you simply spend more time trying. It may help to try thinking about other things you enjoy while your nose is in the glass..other things you eat or drink. Getting past the ethanol is again..something that comes with time. You eventually get acclimated to it.
You have to train your nose. I have a sensitive nose and palette to an extent but it's untrainend and I'm young enough that I haven't tasted so much that I have a large library to pull from.

I've had plenty of chocolate to know when a single original dark chocolate tastes fruity or nutty or distinctively vanilla-ish when it's not a flavoured chocolate bar. Just the notes you get from the cocoa beans and the terroir. Some people do this with wines.

I've only been drinking whiskey very irregularly for a handful of years and only in the past few years have I tried enough variety that I'm learning what I like. I haven't developed it further to note tastes and scents  - yet. But with time, more tasting. And visiting a lot more distilleries and maybe doing some reading, I'll develop my palette much more.

I think it's a talent and skill - but importantly it requires dedication and practice, and a lot more attention than you'd think.
Most of it is for show. There are very few smells that can come from whiskeys. Most of the time people are smelling things based on their surroundings, what they had eat or drink before that alters things, or they want to believe it so they think they are smelling it. Also a glencarin does mean anything. They say you concentrate the smell to your nose. It‚Äôs about surface area to evaporate to smell it. Those are small. Also using one of those is a good way to burn out your sense of smell early. 

I don‚Äôt like using a glencarin because they are hard to drink from and I don‚Äôt pick up any difference in how things smell compared to a normal whiskey glass. 

With that all being said there are certain scent that can be picked up. Certain types of fruit, vanilla, oak, and if they do anything with finishing then it can change. But for the most part it‚Äôs usually 2-4 different smells and flavors. Nothing like 10-15.
A lot of people are mentioning practice and sniffing correctly but for me the biggest reason I pull out these seemingly nonsense notes is that everything tastes basically the same. You get the same basic notes but sometimes in a different order. So if you do get good at smelling and tasting you still may only pull out a slightly different note. But describing that note that is different can be really hard.

For example my bottle of makers 46 cask strength smells and tastes like drinking pinesol to me. It is enjoyable but it still smells like the floor cleaner. Or, when I am really in the mood and enjoying the glass that same pine like smell reminds me of the woodshop class I took in 8th grade. 

For me whiskey is about the expirence of drinking it and pulling out weird flavors and memories is a big part of it.
Agreed.  I use ice.  It helps to tone down the burn a little.  And, as the ice begins to melt and dilute the bourbon a little, I can begin to taste it a bit more.   I try to smell it and ‚Äúchew‚Äù it a bit.  I‚Äôm still learning, but this helps me to understand what I‚Äôm drinking.
http://recenteats.blogspot.com/2016/10/tasting-notes-through-years.html

You don't have to be into tasting notes to enjoy good whiskey. But also, don't knock them coming from other people if you have not put in the work of trying to describe how something tastes to an audience who want details because that helps them to decide whether to go with choice A or with choice B. It isn't as easy as it looks.
I jumped in a  swimming pool and just felt water. I dunno what this Michael Phelps dude is talking about.
Put a few drops of whiskey on the palm of your hand and rub until it dries. The alcohol will dissipate and you can smell the different notes. When you drink the whiskey those notes will stand out.
As a related question- where do these notes come from? Like how can we smell cherry and honey in whiskey?
Pick 2-3 of: vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, some molasses, baking spices, cherry, fruit, honey, oak, and you have 99% of youtube bourbon reviews
This kind of tasting is more about practice. You get it even if you think you don‚Äôt. But you have to train your palate. It‚Äôs easier to get started than you think. Start by tasting three totally different styles. Have a bourbon, rye, and scotch unmarked. Mix em up. Smell, taste. You‚Äôll probably know which is which. Then think about why‚Ä¶ What about the aroma, flavor, even the viscosity let you know which one is which? Smoke for scotch, sweet vanilla for bourbon, spice for rye. Easy. 

If you want to start at the beginning, buy some La Croix. Get two flavors, maybe grapefruit and lemon. Pour them side by side and mix em up. Hold your nose and take a sip. It just tastes like bubble water‚Ä¶ when you release your nose, you‚Äôll get the fruit. The ‚Äúflavor‚Äù here is just aromatics. Smell and taste are a big overlapping Venn Diagram, and everyone does this all the time without thinking about it. 

Over time, you‚Äôll be able to pick up on more subtleties as you go. Have fun!
Buy or create yourself a nosing kit.
For me it has been helpful to know that the compounds they are picking up on come off more like pieces of the note described. 

Chocolate for example can likely be attributed to the fusel alcohol, isoamyl alcohol. It‚Äôs a light, somewhat ethereal grainy to fudgy note. Not the whole breadth of chocolate by a mile. 

And so on. Folks get good at targeting specific chemical markers and without flavor chemistry training, build their own personal lexicons to identify and call them out.
Buffalo Trace straight up smells like an apple
I think the aromas/taste with bourbon is somewhat less varied (but no less delicious!) than other forms of whiskey, right?
Bulleit Rye tastes like plastic
Consider getting one of the [Boubon Nosing Kit](https://www.bespokepost.com/store/nose-your-bourbon-nosing-kit?b=true&a=m_google_performancemax_manual&utm_campaign=Google_PMax_Margin-45-49&utm_term=135657&nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ax%3A19816324786%3A%3A&nb_adtype=pla&nb_kwd=&nb_ti=&nb_mi=101157940&nb_pc=online&nb_pi=135657&nb_ppi=&nb_placement=&nb_li_ms=&nb_lp_ms=&nb_fii=&nb_ap=&nb_mt=&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAvdCrBhBREiwAX6-6UqPhF6jAn9Xv8x62y10uwd4fCTMCH7xRyt1huPpLNp7r7pdqTLWZUBoChxsQAvD_BwE)s out.
It's part experience, part imagination and part stretching any association you come up with really, really hard. Been there, never again. At least with Scotch, there a lot of variety but bourbons just smell like bourbons, all of them.

Also, it'd be arguably pretty repetetive if people reported only what they really smell, because in case of bourbon it'd be ethanol/oak/vanilla/banana ad absurdum for every imaginable brand of bourbon ever.
Put your (clean) hand over the bottle, splash a little on your hand, rub your hands together to evaporate the alcohol, give your cupped hands a good whiff. Now that you smell some things, give it a taste and see if you pick up the same notes you smelled. It might not be toasted cashews but it might be cherries, vanilla, shortbread cookies, or something like that. Sometimes you get a flavor that is very specific, sometimes the ethanol just kills flavor and you get the heat over the taste.
Same. Although I suppose all that comes with experience, and I've only been drinking whiskies just under 3 years.
I was watching a documentary, Scotch: A Golden Dream, and they had a segment on nosing. In short, there is a technique, add water, and your life experiences with a variety of smells. Personally, I‚Äôm glad they all smell and taste different and there are many varieties to enjoy. Same for cigars.
You can start to try dried fruits, peanuts, different breads, popcorn and candies when you sample whiskey to develop your palate.  I like to leave out lots of stuff when there are certain whiskeys.  There are tasting kits as well that can do an even better job helping you identify notes.  Good luck on your journey.
Just because you can't doesn't mean others can't.
 When you drink try to focus on ANYTHING the taste reminds YOU of.  


Then CONCENTRATE on that little hint of flavor and see if you can narrow it down some.  


 Like if a whiskey reminds me (at all, a lil glimmer) of citrus. Is it apples? Green? Red? Apple skin? Pie?  
Or maybe it's a certain type of orange or is it the peel of an orange.   


It is interesting because they say SMELL is the best reminder but I don't get much on the nose. It just amazes me how you can be reminded of from a few drops of the good stuff.

Ya when people get into their 12th flavor they‚Äôre detecting and it‚Äôs something really obscure I get pretty skeptical. Been drinking for many years and you can certainly taste differences and certain flavors, but I‚Äôm not sure about how carried away some people get.
You have to understand that most of the people that write shit like that are pretentious assholes
It's not for show. You can exercise your palate and olfactory system. It takes practice, and some are more natural than others. 

There's even scientific explanations for the aromas you can get from fermented beverages like whisky, or wine. 

Basically there are literally 1000's or more chemicals and flavour compounds in wine and whisky, and your brain is trying to match it up with other things you've smelled and tasted. The more you smell and taste things mindfully, actually thinking about it while you do it, the better you will be at matching these flavours and aromas when you nose and drink wine or whisky.
That's Hilarious and True Shit Right there
Half the people on this sub will start describing notes they smell from an unopened bottle in a cupboard 30 ft away.
Things that I sometimes do to get more nose and flavors when I'm struggling:

&#x200B;

First coat the glass - let it sit 10-15 minutes and let the alcohol evaporate from the sides. 

Take a few drops and put it in your palms, rub them together and smell.

Don't eat anything 15-30 minutes before tasting & nothing spicy.

After the first taste, sip a bit of water, sip again.

Then put a few drops of water in the whiskey, swirl and taste again. Note the differences.
I love the ‚Äúlightly mulled cherry‚Äù not medium mulled cherries or cherries that have been sucker punched, only gently tickled cherries.
Sniffs glass. 

Smells exactly like the inside of a 78 Pinto, yellow in color and with a slight timing problem, maybe running a bit on the rich side, low quality oil too the owner isn‚Äôt using the good stuff. Cheap bastard.
I read the post and ‚ÄúThe Bourbon Junkies ‚Äú came to mind ü§£
I get it OP. I put it in a glass, drink it, & I either like it or don't.
They are definitely pulling stuff out of their ass. For example, in SLB‚Äôs recent Bookers flight, they claimed that a few of them were giving a very sweet berry and dark cherry nose and palate. I have had all 4 Bookers batches this year, not a single one had any berry/cherry notes in it whatsoever. Just your typical nutty profile. Won‚Äôt keep YT viewers engaged for a whole video if every bookers you drink smells/tastes like ‚Äúpeanuts‚Äù
My most common flavors are: vanilla, oak, cinnamon, cherry, anise, sugar cookie, cola, cacao, nutmeg, Clove, all spice, cr√®me br√ªl√©e, brown sugar, caramel, leather, banana. Yes, I taste them in hints and waves.
I‚Äôve never bought a bourbon because some said it tastes like‚Ä¶? Everyone‚Äôs flavor profile, budget and availability is different. Drink what you like. For me, it‚Äôs been about every bottle I‚Äôve tried. I started with Jim Beam when I was about 13. I‚Äôd say most since then have been better.
I use a Glencarin style glass. It does help a bit but I'm not picking up 20 different notes like some of these people.
Also try sniffing with your mouth slightly open. It will get rid of the alcohol smell and allow you to actually pick up some smells!
Last week I picked up a bottle of OF 1920. I was thinking the same as OP. Some of the tasting notes I've read seem bonkers. Anyway, I was sniffing/sipping the 1920 as I read some tasting notes for it here. As soon as I read ""bananas"" the distinct smell immediately hit me. It was like someone flipped a switch. I had eaten a very ripe banana earlier that morning, so the smell was still fresh on my mind. Maybe if I had a scratch and sniff of all the possible smells/flavors I could pick up on those notes. Hmmmmm
>look up reviews or distillery notes

Don't have any personal experience but I've seen a few reviewers say you can't trust the distillery notes as accurate.
I guess it might fully click one day. I was sipping Old Forester 100. Banana notes are one thing people say they get from OF. I actually got that. Even let my wine drinking non bourbon drinking girlfriend try a sip and she caught it too. Honestly at the end of the day it really doesn't matter. You either like a bourbon or don't. Notes just seems like a basis of discussion.
I enjoy a cigar every once in a while. And I did read an article stating the same thing. Notes are not the same as tastes and smells. With a cigar I either get smooth tobacco or rich tobacco. Peppery or not. Which the pepper notes are based on the tobacco leaves and the level of nicotine. I've never picked up hints of chocolate, butterscotch or anything else I see people getting. I like what I like.
Comparison tasting has done wonders for me. With bourbon I like to use Old Crow as my baseline then go from there. I figure the ""lower"" the benchmark, the more differences (flavors, notes) I'll notice.
Rex & Daniel were my first ""mentors"" of whisk(e)y, they are from whom I learned comparison tasting and that's how you discover all these notes. I didn't see the mechanical nose one, I've long left them for Ralfy. But they were great when I was first starting out.
That's kind of where I'm at. Scent forget it. But tatse I can usually pick up oak and char to greater or lesser  degrees depending on the bourbon, fruity but non specific fruits, sweet but not one specific sweet thing, maybe a little vanilla and sometimes powdery cocoa. That's about it. I tasted a Makers Mark Private Selection that was described by the selectors as a ""chocolate bomb"". I got zero chocolate or even cocoa.
The only time ice has made a difference is with Old Forester 100. I added a tiny cube and it took away the campfire smokiness and brought out the banana note. Ice has never made a difference with anything else.
I got better at it by having small pours of a couple similar things side by side. When I had two somewhat close things to compare, it was easier to pick out nuances.
üò≤
I've read something similar that if you leave a glass of bourbon that you just drank unwashed overnight you can pick up notes the next morning.
>Like how can we smell cherry and honey in whiskey?

A combination of flavors developed during fermentation, which include esters:

http://whiskyscience.blogspot.com/2011/11/fermentation-flavours.html

and other congeners, such as fusel oils, which may have more earthy flavors, especially those coming from the tails (feints) of the distillation - this is why for example Laphroaig single malt scotch is so pungent and funky (even by comparison with other heavily peated malts), because they use an asymmetric middle cut which favors the feints (the high boiling point compounds which vaporize from the wash later towards the end of a pot still batch distillation).

Then the oak adds flavors:

http://whiskyscience.blogspot.com/2011/02/oaky-flavours.html

And lastly, while whisky is maturing in a barrel or cask it interacts with the air, both inside and outside the cask (which is permeable to vapor). This allows an extremely complicated series of oxygenation reactions to unfold. The latter create new flavor compounds such as additional esters, but they are slow and take lots of time - which is why older, more mature whiskies can have very complex flavor profiles - because of the way that new flavor compounds are being formed during the aging process:

https://web.archive.org/web/20161021051858/https://redwhiteandbourbon.com/2015/07/03/the-fallacy-of-instant-bourbon-part-ii-the-science/
To my taste that is correct. Bourbons tend to express themselves within a more compact range of flavors, than do malt whiskies like scotches, Irish whiskies, etc.

Some of that may be coming from the strong flavor of corn when using a corn dominated mashbill.

Much of it may be coming from an oak-dominated maturation, because bourbons are aged in charred new oak containers and mostly in a hot climate which tends to promote a stronger interaction between the cask and the maturing spirit. 

Although we don't normally think of them this way, bourbons are a hot climate whisky, sharing that feature in common with other very strongly cask-influenced whiskies like for example Kavalan in Taiwan and Amrut, Paul John, etc. in India, Starward in Australia.

If you look at the list of flavors coming from oak, you'll notice they describe a lot of stereotypical bourbon flavors:

Cheers
LOL I only started in August so I have a ways to go.
Oh I'm not denying all bourbon or cigars tatse the same. They are most definitely different. But my point was how much of these 20 different notes in one glass are they really getting. Seems more for show to keep people interested.
I get that. But many of these reviews just seem like they are making it up as they go. Distiller gives 5 notes. YouTube reviewer gives 20 notes. Some of them seem a little far fetched.
You know what's funny. Every once in a while I'll think about a particular bourbon that I have had while at work or other random places. And I actually start to tatse that bourbon on my tongue. Really weird.
There are no wrong answers for what the taste reminds you off. Everyone tastes different.
Or just shilling for their ""industry partners"" in hopes of one day landing a cush job at a distillery. But re pretention, I don't think I've come across anymore more pretentious than Richard Paterson. While he has some good points here and there, you have to sift through all the hay to get to the needle. And his swirling a whisky in the glass then throwing it on the floor was considered a major party foul back in my day.
Something like that in a review I watched is what brought me to make this post in the first place. It was bananas. They said it wasn't like whole bananas but it was mushed bananas. I never realized mushed bananas tasted and smelled different than whole bananas.
I actually don't watch them. Too frat boyish. I see this mostly with two different couples.
Best I get is caramel, chocolate, oak, vanilla, brown sugar, maple syrup consistently.

Depending on the whiskey, I‚Äôll get short bread cookie; cherry; raisin; leather; or malt. Nothing wild like overcooked hamburger or baseball mitt (although this sounds like leather). 

Also, if you‚Äôre open to trying, add 3-6 drops of water per oz of whiskey. It‚Äôll cut the ethanol/heat and let the other flavors shine out.
I think this skill gets better with practice.
It can get better with practice. Some people are genetically disadvantaged in this area. Also tobacco use can impact your sense on smell/taste.
Some really thought out replies here. I'm beginning to think my sense of smell just may be going dim with age. As far as taste I know when I taste a bourbon that I like and one not so much. Example I love Buffalo Trace. It does have a sweeter and what I would call frutier profile. Not that I can pick out specific fruits. It's just fruity. Now when I tried a Buffalo Trace barrel pick I didn't notice any scent difference. But when I tasted there was an immediate difference. It had an overpowering char taste that drowned out most of what I like about BT. I will revisit it in a month or so to see if my thoughts change. But I did notice a major difference. 

And one thing, which I mentioned in another reply, is every now and then when I'm at work or driving I'll think about a particular bourbon that I might have had the night before or several days before. And I can actually start to taste it on my tongue. Like the lingering tatse you get after having a sip. Just to a much lesser degree. It's the weirdest thing. I'm not sure if that has something to do with my palate becoming more acclimated to bourbons or my mind screwing with my senses.
>Maybe if I had a scratch and sniff of all the possible smells/flavors I could pick up on those notes.

I haven't tried 'em but I've seen there are nosing kits you can buy that have different common whiskey aromas.
Could be true, I dunno.  I will also save or screenshot reviews I see here on r/whiskey and compare to the distiller notes as well. There‚Äôs really only so many notes available though, and so many of them share notes‚Ä¶seems like every one I look up says some assortment of red fruit/caramel/vanilla/oak/etc with a few others listed here and there so it gets repetitive after a while.
I‚Äôve gotten some chocolate on cigars, but like a bitter dark chocolate, and leather for sure. But I agree I think a lot of it is people just describing the flavor of tobacco
There are certain flavors that only come from how it‚Äôs made. The barrel, char, type of whiskey used and aging. Adding staves to the barrel, finishing in wine barrels or different grain mixes changes the way it can taste but to a degree. When you step into scotch it‚Äôs a bit of a different story. I think mainly people have this idea of what they want it to taste like and are overwhelmed with the idea they think it tastes like it. 

Example. Without seeing it you know what an orange is when eating and smelling it and same for pretty much every other food. It‚Äôs not like you can sit and think about what type of flavor it is over time.

I‚Äôve been drinking whiskey for ten years. There‚Äôs times I sit and dive into the flavor and smell from my first drink to my last and the flavor and smell changes with each drink.
Drink it how you like it.  But do you know about the Kentucky Chew?   Look that up on YouTube if you don‚Äôt.
Yes, that is how I learned too. Lots of side-by-sides, especially with 3 whiskies. I find much easier to compare A,B,C and then ask if B is closer to A or if it is closer to C - and what notes specifically make it that way.

And then read lots of reviews and using them go back to the whiskies I have, to see if I can find the notes mentioned (sometimes yes, sometimes no).

Cheers
Cool /s
Try the hand trick next time you open a new bottle. You'll find that those notes pop because you'll be expecting them.
After a certain point, I tend to agree. Your original example was a little exaggerated, but I get that that was the point.
I still will get the scent of my elementary school library with their little stools and it takes me right back to that place.  


Also...   


I don't do drugs.  


Drugs are bad for the body.  


But I used to do (some) drugs.   


And one certain one (that I only tried a few times along time ago) would pop up strong every once in a long while. And I'll be like mmm I should get me some more of that stuff! I didn't.   


Man now that I think about it ..... I haven't had these sensations since covid.
My weirdest experience was one morning for breakfast I had a banana. It reminded me of a bourbon I had a few days prior. Not the bourbon reminding me of the banana, but the other way around. THAT was strange.
Another favorite of mine is ‚Äúold horse blanket‚Äù or ‚Äúmoist barn hay‚Äù and then a 8 or 9/10‚Ä¶ like, you kidding me‚Ä¶old horse blanketü§å perfection.
I do love a glass of baseball mitt every once in awhile
Yes, a touch of water helps me out greatly.
No. If someone can't do something immediately, then it's fake. Skills are a conspiracy. It's just the government trying to trick us into improving our quality of life.
I think it‚Äôs mostly bullshit.
Have you ever blinded a few bourbons in a flight? 

I assure you, your mind is indeed screwing with you, after all, your mind doesn‚Äôt actually taste anything, ever. All it does is interpret electricity in a way that makes you think a specific thought. We actually don‚Äôt even have a means to check and see if what you taste as banana is the same thing I taste as banana. 

It‚Äôs the Tasty Wheat Paradox, not sure if you know this meme-like saying. The brain is wild and is somehow the smartest and dumbest thing in the room at the exact same time lol 

I had a wheat whiskey the other night‚Ä¶ smelled and tasted like a duck pond surrounded by cat tails. Wet, reedy, rich silt mud, water on the air. How the F can I get that off a pour of whiskey!?!?!? I have no idea. It stunned me and absolutely horrified me that I had such a terrible bottle in my meager collection. 

I literally had deja vu, back to a very specific time and place I had been as a kid. Very very specific. 

Today I smelled it and it has only a bready, somewhat buttery smell. For several days I have been having that experience you described except instead of my favorite bourbon it was this duck pond experience, seriously weird. 

The mind is screwing with me on this one lol
Yup I do the chew every once in a while.
I'll give it a shot
I'm glad you caught that. It was a lot exaggerated. LOL
If my bourbon doesn't taste like wet dog it's a drain pour. ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
Just like going down on grandma.
That would be a first.
Sometimes I take a sip of a bottle AND I HATE IT.    
Then sometimes I will do almost a mouthful from the same bottle and hold it for a bit then a lil swish before swallowing AND I LOVE IT.
Well that escalated quickly!

Found North Peregrine 20 year review,"You know I haven‚Äôt been posting on this Reddit a long time but I have been drinking whiskey and collecting for a very long time.

This is hands down the best whiskey I‚Äôve ever tasted. 

The flavor notes with combination of fruit, spice, wood, vanillin and citrus are exceptionally balanced. 

I‚Äôll edit with a more detailed review later but I couldn‚Äôt wait to share with you guys.",
Well thus was a fun afternoon,"Sorry for the not great pic, but we had to open these for science. If we are sharing at Christmas, these need to be properly opened and allowed to breath.

Quick hits....ER store pick 11yr 3mo. Heavier sweet oak balancing classic BT grape kool-aid/cherry fun dip powder fruit notes. Finish has some barrel char and a nice amount of spice. Mid palate is a bit hot. Nothing crazy. Will benefit from a rest.

Jack Daniels 12 yr. Wow. Fucking wow. I mean that nose is everything I love about JD just cranked to sexxxy. Seriously it's so fruity and inviting, balanced with brown sugar and baking spice. Yum yum carmel bananas and bright but secondary cherry on the palate. Dumb good. Finish matches the palate. Slight oak taking over. Looooong finish. Outstanding. All flavors last forever. Can crush out of the bottle. Sometimes the best glass to use is the glass it came in. My God we need to do everything in our power as JD lovers to get this into mass production. 

Mister Sam....You are a man of distinguished taste. The layers of flavor are going to take the entirety of you to even begin to understand the amount of knowledge and craftsmanship presented to me. The heat took some getting used to. These were all fresh cracks so we can get some airtime on them before the holidays. The nose is light and dark all at once. Top notes are fruit and butterscotch. Vanilla cream. Floral notes like fresh cut prarie grass comes out, but I can't pinpoint it. Bottom notes are leather and furniture polish. Oh you are an old soul Mister Sam. Like well aged varnish and oak laying underneath. Palate starts very sweet. Buttery. How does it coat the mouth yet present all the light flavors up front at the same time? Waves of fruit preserve. Peach and blueberry? The mid palate transition is where I get lost right now. I attribute that to being just cracked and 128.8pf. There is flavor there that will reveal itself with airtime. The finish tries to steal the show. I don't remember a finish that lasted longer or made me smile so much. Everything comes back. So balanced. Red fruit. Apple pie spice. Savory rye spice. Near umami. That forest floor/fall wet leaves/that smell after the rain. And again. And again. Work your tounge around the corners of your mouth and you find pockets of flavor 3 minutes later. Can't wait till you open up and show me more secrets.

Thanks for reading the rant! Happy drinking season! ü•É","Sky rockets in flight....Afternoon delight.
Gonna be a very merry Christmas as your place this year! Thanks for following up with the review! These all sound amazing--the Mr. Sam sounds particularly tasty.  Glad you're enjoying them all.  Cheers!
Guys, is there some magical place where you can get Mister Sam? What's going on?
The Mister Sam flex is real, next to a JD12. Well played sir.
Beautiful. My buddy got a Mister Sam, hoping he likes me enough to share.
Completely agree with your JD12 assessment. I really wanted to not like it just based on hype but damn, really special bottle 

I was also lucky enough to get a Mister Sam. Even after all my reviews I‚Äôm intimidated to give it a try, I know the notes are going to blow me away. Probably crack for new years. 

Thanks for the great reviews
There is so much there. I can taste the bourbon, rye, and a distinct Canadian spice reserved in highly aged cold climate barrels. It's truly a work of art in blending spirits. The first ounce was a bit hot as to be expected, but another small pour and some rest tells the story of a well crafted whiskey. Very excited to see how it opens. Giving me WT MK Unforgotten vibes with the nose and initial sip with the creamy vanilla entry
I mean, there are 1200-3000 bottles produced. That makes it some of the rarest stuff around, but it‚Äôs still over a thousand bottles. Figure the couple lucky people on these whiskey subs who got them of course post them, but that doesn‚Äôt make it not impossible to get
Friend of mine got the jack 12. I was 7th in the raffle and drew a Mister Sam. We believe when we open bottles, karma brings us more. May the whiskey gods shine upon you. Cheers.
P.S. that jack 12 held its own yesterday. That is an incredible bottle at an incredible msrp if one can find it. I have a J10, and it packs more spice punch, but the proof holds it back on the finish. If you don't like Jack, try the 12yr, and still don't like Jack...we can't be friends. Their special releases have been absolutely stellar as of the last 5 years or so. 

I attended a whiskey tasting/cocktail competition earlier this spring with 2 buddies. JD was there with the 10yr, 12yr, and SBBP. I don't think I have to say it, but I had to leave the New Riff and OF and other tables behind and just keep getting back in line for my flight of 3 JD special releases in plastic ramekins ü§£ü§£ü§£ I feel like I must have crushed half a bottle of jack between all three I kept sampling and the 12 yr was just outstanding. And the SBBP was like drinking thick room temp maple syrup and pancakes next to it. Glad we had a sober driver cause I was pie eyed. It tastes even better right outta the bottle at home. I'm serious we need to petition for more 12 yr!
I hope he does. Definitely let your pour rest about 20 or 30 minutes.  Once my palate adjusted to the proof, it was a taste sensation. I'll try another ounce next week, and then I'll wait till Xmas to share with fam and friends to see how it has evolved. Hope to make it last the year and analyze it along the way till the next raffle!
Heard. I've acquired many great bottles over my bar career. Long time lurker here and decided I need to give my 2 cents  since I've been fortunate enough to open some of these ü¶Ñ  Now we need a double-digit age stated BP of some sort outta JD. I'll wait over here......in the corner. 

Yup I felt not worthy opening MS. That mid palate was kinda hot and distracting on the first crack. To be expected, so I will have to give a formal review after rsting and around half the bottle is consumed. Very crazy how it flips back and forth from sweet to savory.
That horseshoe up may ass is getting uncomfortable. Just pulled down one of the new EHTBP that busted 130pf. I'm afraid to go outside or else lighting may strike or that bus might hit me. Will have to post that crack too
So‚Ä¶ The MS‚Ä¶ Is the hype real?
Unfortunately... it is. But hey, it's cheaper than the WT Generations and only slightly harder to find! Imagine having cart blanche over all of Sazeracs stocks, and you can do whatever you want with that power. Don't let the label that says a blend of Canadian and American whiskeys throw you. I try to do my best to pick flavors out. I concentrate on tiny sips. I'm not sure I will ever be able to convey how complex and nuanced this bottle is. I know once that bottle opens and the mid palate isn't where the heat lies and opens up those flavors, it's going to be one of the best, if not the best, I've ever had.
I didn‚Äôt doubt it. Nice work mang. Happy holidays. You‚Äôre already killin it one week in.
Wild Turkey generations has a 5000 bottle release. Still stupid rare, but that would make Mister Sam 2-4x as rare
Yeah and didn't they mostly sell out on the presale in like 45 seconds? Campari running a racket over there. Those are gonna be ridiculous on the secondary. What was this batch 3 production run bottle count on Mister Sam?
You batch 3 of mister Sam over 5 years. So releases every two years since 2019"
Happy independence day Finland!,"Celebrating with some Finnish single malt whisky. √Ñgr√§s VYS single malt is a once distilled and matured in Pedro Ximenes barrell for six years.

Import Updates: Ichiro‚Äôs Malt US Edition 2024,"2024 has landed, and it‚Äôs phenomenal! For those of you who have tried 2022 or 2023, this is a bottle to look forward to.

Bottle Design 10/10. This is the first time that the US Edition has changed the design in recent memory. Definitely a surprise!

Nose 8/10. The smell profile isn‚Äôt as distinctive as 2022, but with hints of cherrywood and peat moss, it‚Äôs really enjoyable!

Flavor 9/10. Wow. Tastes like 2018 and 2022, but sweeter. It‚Äôs lacking a cask list, so hard to tell what is what. However, I am tasting some sweet cider notes along with the typical imperial stout finish. The flavor lasts about a minute on the palate and starts to taper around 50 seconds. It changes from graham cracker-like to peaty and right back to single malt notes.

Cost 7/10. Wholesale is somewhere around $220 and your typical bottle sells in store for about $350. You‚Äôve really gotta love the distinctive flavor of an Ichiro‚Äôs bottle to cough up the dough here. The bottle does not have a cask list and bottle number. The QR code is also dead on the back so we will see on the regard. Truly a sign of a small family owned business are slight imperfections like that.

Overall 34/40. If I saw this bottle for under $400 later in the year, I‚Äôd definitely justify that kind of spend!

If you‚Äôve ever had Ichiro‚Äôs before, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts about the distillery and the bottles!","This is a really nice breakdown and I love the review you've done here! I'll do some touring where I live and see if I can find it. It sounds like the type of bottle I will definitely enjoy üëç The fact that its a family owned business stands out to me as well, not easy to get into this market these days with how many brands there are available especially in the US. I'll update you when I find it!

ECBP c923 -bad bottle?,"Has anyone else cracked this bottle and not
Liked it? I‚Äôve had 4 different pulls of this and drink it every which way. Neat and rested.. couple drops of water.. splash of water‚Ä¶ I do not enjoy it. I do not get any notes that reviewers have mentioned. 

Other review of other whiskey I can taste and smell the notes. This bottle that everyone loves‚Ä¶ tastes like chemicals and nail polish remover. Eagle Rare is better and I don‚Äôt love Eagle rare, just proving a point. I‚Äôm not some rookie tater, I enjoy high proof whiskey and have a good taste. 

I think I may have gotten a bad bottle. 

It‚Äôs very sad.","Maybe you just don‚Äôt like c923? My bottle tastes fine but is not earth shattering to my pallet. Others feel differently. Only way really to know would be for you to find another bottle and compare. There‚Äôs always a chance of a bad bottle but heaven hill batched products are pretty consistent in my experience
[deleted]
C923 tastes like every other EC BP batch I have tried.  Groupthink takes over in a lot of these situations; don't be upset if you don't necessarily care for something everyone else pretends to enjoy.
Does the cork have a lot of black circles and discoloration on it? Did it have a plastic seal wrapping the cork before you opened it?
I found it very harsh and HOT Neat. But delicious with a hefty splash of water.  I am with you. Seems this was getting tons of hype and praise instantaneously. The Internet is a powerful tool that can shape opinions and perceptions.
Glad someone finally said it. 

We did a big ECBP tasting last week, it was by far last place. 

8yr store pick. B522, B523 and C923. Wasn‚Äôt close. 

This was my 4th different pour from my C923, none were enjoyable or earth shattering like what I‚Äôve been reading. 

I broke out some Bombergers and Micthers BP toasted rye to make sure my taster was still working, and damn if they weren‚Äôt delicious. 


C923 reminded me of just sucking on an unlit cigar.

Call me crazy I guess
It‚Äôs you. It‚Äôs always the drinker.
I like it. However, I'm a huge EC fan. I will say that their hype machine has been off the fucking charts for these and it really shouldn't be. The B523 has been my favorite one this year.
Are you used to drinking such a high proof? At 133 this batch is high, even for ECBP. Eagle Rare is 90 proof, by comparison.
Maybe you just don‚Äôt care for the C923 and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. 

Personally, I like it. I blinded it with B522,C922 and A123 the other night. It was close between C922 and C923. I had unknowingly given the edge to C923. C922 was a close second. A123 was far behind C922 and B522 was an easy last place for me.
Most hype around c923 seemed to stem from Reddit reviews prior to seeing much else but eh‚Ä¶ plenty of people out there insisting WT 101 and EW BiB are earth shattering and they both are horrid‚Ä¶ must be those influencers yo‚Ä¶.
I love B523.  That‚Äôs why I think I have a bad bottle.
Ya I‚Äôm used to higher proof. I know bourbon. 

I was only saying Eagle Rare because it‚Äôs cheap. 

I have and love bookers,  Stagg jr, Four Roses barrel strength, JDSBBP. I‚Äôve had other ECBPs that I‚Äôve liked. I really enjoy ECBP b523. 

The proof does not bother me, it‚Äôs The flavor of c923. 

For all those talking about influencers or whatever. I‚Äôm not a targeted bourbon drinker. I don‚Äôt buy based on reviews or video etc. I buy what‚Äôs available and things I want to try. Or I buy what I‚Äôm getting low on"
Review found north single barrel season 2 batch 8,"
Introducing Found North Single Barrel (STORE PICK) Season 2 Barrel #008 Canadian Whisky finished in Char 3 New Wood! ü•≥

Season 2 consists of 20 different Barrels which all started as a 4-whisky blend with the following ratios:
29% 12 year rye in ex-bourbon
30% 23 year corn in New Wood
36% 15 year corn in ex-bourbon
5% 25 year corn in ex-bourbon
The Final Mashbill came out to be 70% Corn, 29% Rye, 1% Barley and bottled at 118.6 Proof Cask Strength.

This particular Single Barrel, #008, takes that base whisky blend from above and is aged further in Char 3 New Wood for about 6 months before being bottled.  

My personal Tasting Notes are toasted caramel and creme brulee on the nose.  On the Palate, I get melted toffee, caramel, baked custard, leather and tobacco notes with a noticeable Rye spice on the finish.  The Mouthfeel is leathery and round which gives it great texture.  The Finish has a little heat but still drinks pretty easy for 118.6 proof.  Adding a few drops of water opens it up and I get a good amount of Werther's caramel candy in addition to the Rye spice being even more pronounced.  Very tasty bottle for sure which makes you keep asking for that next sip!! ü§§

Total score 9.2 amazing

Cheers!! ü•É","Wow. I really wanted one of the r/bourbon picks this week. Now I really do. Fingers crossed for overflow.
Thanks for the review! I just ordered one and I think this review is maybe from the same shop :)
How the heck did you score that?!
Just grabbed a bottle, very excited for this one. I‚Äôve never had Found North yet
I wish you luck. I was fortunate and got the pick in the first emails today. Bought both of the r/bourbon picks which will join the bottles of 008 ordered earlier. I've been extremely fortunate recently üòÅ
Saw it on FN's insta; from a shop in MA that doesn't ship. Did manage to grab the two r/bourbon picks to go with another of the Season 2 SiB's finished in Blackstrap Rum.  They're absolutely crushing my wallet right now...and I'm okay with that.
Brooooooo!!! Killer luck, enjoy!
Congrats! I was not so lucky. I guess Batch 008 will have to console me.
It's Found North - the enjoyment is guaranteed üî•üòÅüòÅ.

I wish you an equal helping of luck too üçÄüçÄüçÄüôè"
Port Charlotte & Glenallachie,"Hey whiskey lovers!

I just bought two new bottles of whiskey and I can't wait to crack them open! I'm curious about what you all think about these two. Have you tried them before? Do you have any tasting notes or recommendations for me? Cheers!

Both are non-chill filtered and no colouring.","I currently have them on my shelf, both are really great whiskies. I think you will be happy with your selection ü•É
I have them both and like them both. Obviously on diff ends of the scotch spectrum. Try Glenallachie 15. I like that one much better than the 12 or the 10 CS.
I have both of these on my ‚Äúto try‚Äù list. Curious about opinions as well."
My thoughts on a Buffalo Trace barrel pick,"I will preface this by saying this is not a formal review or rating. I'm not one that picks up 20 different notes on the nose and palate. I like what I like. Thumbs up, thumbs down. Red light, green light. Yay or nay. LOL 

I love Buffalo Trace. It's one of my favorite daily sippers, but I have to baby it. Around here it's really hard to get. And impossible to find at MSRP. I have a connection where I'm able to get it for $10 over when they do get it. So I have four back bottles. 

I picked up two bottles of barrel picks done by Vlamis Liquors in Elkton MD a few weeks ago. Last night I cracked one open. Nose was very similar to regular BT with a little more ethanol. The taste though. This barrel had an overpowering char taste that drowned out the flavors of BT I usually enjoy. Definitely not for me.

I guess this is why I generally avoid barrel picks. You are at the mercy of other people's palates. I just took a chance on this one because I love BT. I know people say there are some great store picks out there. And I'm sure there are. I've tried samples of five different Makers Mark Private Selections. A few of them were really good. One of them was outstanding. And I don't normally like Makers. In this situation it was a no go for me on a barrel pick. And not sure if I will go down that road again without tasting first.","Try it again in a week or two after it‚Äôs been able to sit some now that it‚Äôs open
Think they got any left? Yeah BT isn‚Äôt too easy to find in MD.
Buffalo Trace and Eagle Rare store picks are an auto buy when I see them. Never had a bad one
First time in 3 years, I found it for msrp today. At Walmart of all places
Yep.  

I had a Knob Creek rye that smelled and had a taste of corn mash when I had my first glass.  Went away the next day.
I highly doubt it. There was a 3 bottle limit so I'm sure people were buying three. State Line in Elkton got their barrel pick in a few days after Vlamis and they sold out in two days.
Different palets. And barrel picks can vary so much. In all honesty if was the first BT I ever tried I probably would have not bothered trying the regular.
No worries! It‚Äôd be a trip for me anyway. All the BT picks I‚Äôve tried have just tasted like plain old BT to me, would be interesting to find one that stood out more
Where are you located??
Baltimore co
Ahh that's a bit of a drive for me. I would have suggested a trade or just buy the second bottle from me at cost.
All good! Appreciate the offer üëç"
High West Prisoner Share & Blanton Gold,"Good haul today - my 2nd bottle of MWND 11 and finally this year‚Äôs Prisoner Share. The MWND is just fantastically rich & sweet for drinks. Lucked into Blantons Gold too, though I might save it.

Initial tasting notes on the High West Prisoner:
- Aroma: potpourri, oak, caramel, and obvious tannins on the nose.
- Taste: bold tannins nicely balanced with caramel and spice. Medium finish of oak with lingering spice & astringency that adds a nice texture and mouthfeel. Maybe some brown fig too.
- Rating: 7.75 on t8ke, almost excellent but doesn‚Äôt quite have that spark to push it over. I think I prefer MWND 11 as it has a more buttery mouthfeel.","I just about went over and bought one of the Prisoners Share.  $180 is right over my line of ‚Äúohhh I better think about this‚Äù.
Haha yeah there‚Äôs a ton of really good stuff in that price range. This is good, but not $180 good. I think I got mine for $169. I think high west is going to have to increase their quality even more or lower prices once people realize their limited releases aren‚Äôt as limited.
I suspect their general store will still have some after the start of the new year so I think I‚Äôve got time to think about it.  I was able to get two of the MWND and a Bourye in one day but that took some thinking as it was a full step past I gotta think about this.  How does the Prisoners Share compare to a glass of red wine????
Haven‚Äôt seen the Bourye yet, how is it?

The prisoner share doesn‚Äôt taste anything like wine other than the tannins, and there isn‚Äôt much red fruits. I don‚Äôt like prisoner as it‚Äôs a blend, and I‚Äôm more into single vineyard reds rather than blends.
Haven‚Äôt gotten past the first small pour yet.  It‚Äôs very nice just off that first pour.  I don‚Äôt have the palette or vocabulary like my wife does to describe it other than to say, it is totally worth the $60 price tag.  My wife (went to school for pastry arts) is a way better judge and she loved it."
Finally obtained my top unicorn,"I‚Äôll probably crack this New Year‚Äôs Eve in celebration of a tough but rewarding year. This will be my 200th bourbon review 

I‚Äôve been blessed to snag and taste a lot of great whiskies, but this one is definitely special","Man.  My state has 17 of these coming in and I‚Äôm watching them like a hawk.  I‚Äôll be camping out when I see them lower inventory if they don‚Äôt lottery them.  They don‚Äôt lottery a lot of allocated they just drop randomly.
Congrats! I was 2 spots away in a local lottery from buying this at MSRP. Still hurts!!!
Congrats!  Enjoy it, thats truly a special one.
She's a beaut, Clark!
Very nice! Only ever seen it online for $3k but hear it‚Äôs amazing. Looking forward to the review! Cheers!
Never even heard of it! Sourced? Distilled by them? Age?
The definition of unicorn! We‚Äôll done. Is there an msrp on this bottle? $700 seems like a bargain.
Dammmmmmn so cool!
I thought it said monster jam at first. Never heard of this bottle some good stuff?
They have one of these at my local museum, don't know what they priced it was in the thousands range for sure. 

Congrats and I look forward to your tasting and review!
Congrats
Wow! Really looking forward to reading about this one. Congrats!
Very nice! This is on my unicorn list as well. Will be curious to hear what you think. A New Years crack is an awesome way to break this bad boy in! Cheers!
Holy shit. I read your reviews and your collection is a dream to me. I also know you‚Äôre in atlanta and by all means keep it to yourself but I‚Äôm very interested in where you find these bottles.
Congrats! Definitely a top UNI for sure.
So have you tried at least 200 different Bourbons?
Tag me when you review it, I was super disappointed, curious to what you think
These were shockingly sold online recently for 500. A group member got one & did a split. I have 1 oz. I‚Äôm looking forward to sitting down with it. Cheers ü•É
Yeah I‚Äôm seeing anywhere of 5-50 bottles per state depending on the size of state. Crazy I just so happened to see one today
Yeah- I overpaid for this one, but I couldn‚Äôt let it go. It‚Äôs different than BTAC or pappy, I see them every year so figure one day I may get lucky. This was the only bottle I‚Äôve ever seen and I think the only bottle in the SE Atlanta area, couldn‚Äôt pass it up
Cheers, thanks amigo. Will probably crack it on New Year‚Äôs Eve. Can‚Äôt wait to see if it‚Äôs a 10/10
Thanks Pre, you‚Äôve taught me everything I know about external illumination‚Ä¶ and whiskey
I‚Äôve only ever seen one bottle in person, and that was yesterday. $1k price tag. Thought about it all last night. Today decided I had to shoot my shot. Offered $700 cash and owner accepted 

Steepest bottle I‚Äôve ever purchased but I‚Äôm more excited about this than any Pappy or BTAC so I‚Äôm happy
It‚Äôs a Sazerac product. Essentially their top blend. Their master blender has free range of any barrel he wants. BTAC, Pappy, as well as the best Canadian whiskey barrels 

Extremely small amounts. Estimates of 1200-3000 bottles every other year, compared to 86k bottles of pappy annually
Search ‚Äúmister Sam‚Äù in r/bourbon and read pred‚Äôs reviews.
Msrp is $250 (looks like $300 in VABC). No idea what they are on secondary but given online prices I imagine secondary is over $1k if you can find it
I definitely made some room so it was front and center in the shelf
Well I haven‚Äôt tried it yet to be fair. But yes- supposedly very good
I would imagine there is always an off chance it flies under the radar. Apparently this store got only this bottle and it lasted about a week before I saw it. All the taters were buying $150 Blantons instead
Cheers amigo!
Cheers amigo. I‚Äôm stupidly excited to crack this. One month away!
Sent you a PM, I‚Äôm not greedy, but I don‚Äôt have some magic honey hole unfortunately
Far more than that. If I was able to waive a magic wand and review everything open on my bar I‚Äôd be at about 225. But only started reviewing bourbon in 2020, probably have had an equal amount I haven‚Äôt reviewed 

I‚Äôd love to review some of my tequila, scotch, Japanese, and Irish whisky as well, but I‚Äôm so behind on bourbon I never get to them
Will do. Will be a bit though. Only on review #167. Want this guy to be #200

Cheers!
I‚Äôve heard another example of a bourbon group getting a hold of the bottle and doing a split. Pretty cool perk!
Good for you, man.  My car is packed with below freezing clothing and a chair in preparation.
How do you look up what places get bottle allocations?
Where are you looking for bottle inventory?
I mean all things considered 700 for this isn‚Äôt bad, that‚Äôs only like 2x MSRP. Usually see them go for 1400+
Don‚Äôt ask a question if you don‚Äôt want the answer.
To be honest I would be very tempted if I saw it for 1k. I've seen it for over 3k
I never thought of offering cash! Thank you!
Well Well over 1K
Been looking for one as a namesake for myself lol
Looking forward to a review when you pop it! Enjoy nice looking bottle
Taters gonna taste lol. This store also has Weller SR for 130, Blantons Gold for 400, etc but also the largest selection I've seen of non-allocated reasonably priced whiskey (even rivals Total Wine)
If you have a bar you don't need to buy a bottle just for you. Buying more than 200 bottles for a home and drinking them is too much.
Probably the same group. He does reviews on here ü•É
As someone who lived in NOVA, a hack is a propane tank with heater attachment. Makes those long nights way more bearable
Just extrapolating data. There is precious little online but I found articles on batch 1 and 2 that said 1200 bottles were released. Some very knowledgeable reviewers have said this batch may be as high as 3000 bottles 

So dividing by 50 that‚Äôs 24-50 bottles per state, but I know some gets distributed abroad, at least to Canada 

Another Redditor commented here that Indiana is getting 17 bottles. With state controlled inventories like NC and VA you can see state inventory
Replied to comment above
Not sure I get your meaning. I‚Äôll crack this bottle and judge the rating for myself
That was why I went to the ATM and got $800 in cash. If I didn‚Äôt and owner didn‚Äôt lower the price I would have been tempted as well to just throw 1k on the credit card. But I was able to show owner ‚Äúthis is all I had‚Äù so he made it $700 so with tax it was still like $750

I also think it helped that I clearly wasn‚Äôt a flipper. I had read u/prepreludesh review a few times so I was able to have a long discussion with owner on the bottle. He just figured I may as well have it
I don‚Äôt do it all the time, but I do feel like good old greenbacks still hold some weight. Something about actually seeing a stack of Benjamin‚Äôs may make a store owner blink 

It also gives you a very firm line in the sand. I have exactly $800 in my hand make the sale and it‚Äôs yours otherwise it‚Äôs back in my wallet, no room to ‚Äúgo a little higher‚Äù like if I was swiping a credit card 

Plus then stores don‚Äôt have to pay the credit card fee
What‚Äôs up dude! How was tower?
1) I disagree. If they are all opened and enjoyed who cares how many you have 

2) I never said I own 225 bottles of whiskey. Just that if I reviewed everything on my bar I‚Äôd be at review 225. I‚Äôve been at it for a few years, plenty of bottle kills. And not everything I review is from my bar. Probably have a hundred or so bottles on my shelf
Yeah u/jimjamb0rino just reviewed this on r/bourbon, said he had a group do a split in the DC area for $40 (guy got the bottle for $400)

Pretty crazy, I wasn‚Äôt that lucky, but I feel like I got the best price I could
Yeah I‚Äôll only be there from 9am-11am depending on when they drop what store it‚Äôs gonna be at.  Got 2 michters 10 a couple weeks ago by guessing the 2 stores 2 days in a row.  Then I just sit and work on the sidewalk on my laptop.
How do you persuade them that you‚Äôre not a flipper?
I agree. It works in regular bartering situations, and I‚Äôve bartered whiskey prices before; I just never thought about using cash. 

Maybe it‚Äôll help if I can finally secure a GTS
Man it was nice! Smooth sailing,  met a few good people. Had some damn good pours and decent scores! Thought you were going to drop by
Ok, probably I did some assumptions.
Yes, exactly!
Step one, this was sandwhiched between Pappy 15 and Blanton‚Äôs gold. I think when being able to pick this bottle out of a lineup shows you have more than surface level knowledge of whiskey 

Step two, this is actually a very rare bottle even among store owners. This is one of the largest stores in SE Atlanta. They always get pappy verticals and I even saw they got OFC the last two years, but this is the first time they got a Mister Sam and only one. The owner knew it was a Sazerac product but nothing else. So me being able to have a chat with him about the master blender, all the whiskies that could be included in the blend, the purpose of the book inside, etc, again just shows I‚Äôm legitimately interested in the bottle 

And finally, just being honest. I told him you might get a flipper who would pick it up for $1k, but since I‚Äôm going to actually drink it, $800 is the highest I can go 

Can‚Äôt explain the whole interaction very well but in the end I‚Äôm glad I could bring it home
It did for me back in the day. Offered $450 cash for my 2019 GTS. I doubt I‚Äôd be able to get that low in todays market tho
Maybe next year. I was tempted but luckily I was able to score my unicorn a little later!
This isn‚Äôt the most update picture, but a decently accurate shot of my [shelf](https://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/s/hobEXNt8zh)
Nice!!! I just realized, it could help to convince them if they let you open the bottle right there. I‚Äôd share a shot with the owner who sells me a bottle that I‚Äôve been wanting
What store in ATL? I‚Äôm in Athens.
Awesome luck! Looking forward to your review on it.
Sometimes I have difficulties to understand some ideas.
That is the shelf you have in yout home.
I understand that you have a bar where you have many whisky bottles, moreover you have another bottles in your home.
The reviews are from bottles from our bar and from your home.
I‚Äôm not opposed to that, but for that deal I‚Äôd better get msrp. I suppose if owner sold this to me for $250 I‚Äôd have no qualms about opening and sharing with him
Eesh you would have a drive, this was at J&J liquor about 90 minutes from you. This was their only one tho. They have a big selection and a lot of unicorns but top of secondary. I think this flew under the radar a smidge because it‚Äôs not part of the BTAC/Pappy immediately recognized tater lineup
My friends and I are willing to drive for good bottles. We don‚Äôt really see anything here outside of KC 18, EC 18, MWND, etc. No real unicorns. Thanks for the info!
I would check out Eagle landing bottle shop. It‚Äôs next to JJ so you can check both 

They just dropped the prices in their glass case. They are still high, but not completely stupid. Off the top of my head from what I saw yesterday:

Stagg Jr- $200
PHC Double barreled- $399
Old Fitz 10 year- $399
Boss Hog X- $599
WLW- $1k
GTS- $1k

I think they still have some Woodford Batch proof for $150 msrp and a few other items. May be worth a look if you‚Äôre feeling spendy
Hey, thanks!
My friends and I split bottles (so more doable to buy pricier things), but they all stay at my place. Currently about 60 half drunk bottles üòÇ
Np, keep in mind they just dropped the prices yesterday and some stuff like the WLW, while it‚Äôs still expensive it‚Äôs the cheapest in the area so it may walk
Well let me know if you‚Äôre serious about coming down. Stuff changes fast so don‚Äôt hold me to anything but I‚Äôd be willing to take a pic of their glass case if you have a specific question 

Sometimes they are honest if you call them other times they don‚Äôt answer allocated questions over phone, depends who picks up
Yeah, definitely have seen/dealt with that. Thanks and I‚Äôll keep it in mind. Always good to have friends all over for this kind of stuff!"
Advice for my next bottle of Scotch,"After being a long-time lurker of this sub, I have decided it is time to break the seal and ask for some advice. I have been into all forms of whiskey for about a year, and have slowly been expanding my collection while figuring out what I prefer taste-wise.  I am looking to buy another bottle of Scotch under $100, but am unsure what exactly I would like to purchase next. So, I have come seeking advice from more experienced enthusiasts in hopes that I will be guided towards my next favorite bottle.

A few of the bottles of whiskey I have purchased that I love are:

\- Bunnahabhain 12, Lagavulin 16, Four roses BS oesk , Makers Mark Private Selection, Redbreast 12

I absolutely love the BBQ smoke and brine from the Lagavulin and the funk from the Bunnahabhain, leading me to want to buy another islay, but for some reason am intimidated by an Ardbeg or Laphroaig because of the jump in ppm. 

I am also really interested in buying a sherry bomb and have been very interested in either the Glendronach 15 or the Aberlour A‚Äôbunadh. I really enjoy the proof on the Four Roses BS and Makers PS, so that gives points towards the Aberlour, but I have also read so many amazing reviews about the sweetness and richness of the Glendronach that make it hard to pass.

Based on the info above, what would you all suggest I should buy next? Any suggestion helps :)","Check out port Charlotte 10
Ardbeg Uigeadail would give you both the peat and sherry you desire, and is tasty to boot. My personal favorite for that combo is the Laphroaig Cairdeas PX 2021 but this might be harder to find as it a 21 release. Laphroaig also has a 10 year Sherry but I haven't tried it so cannot provide an opinion on that bottle.
That Glendro 15 is excellent!  It's a repurchase for me 100%
I honestly love Ardbeg 10. Just a side note, the ppm thing is junk and in no way gives an accurate representation of how peaty or smoky a whiskey will taste. It can give you an idea, but it's far from being accurate.
Dalmore 15. An elegant sherry bomb. 

Ledaig 18.  A smoky beast.
I was gonna say same thing. Ardbeg Uigeadail seems to fit perfectly and is right under budget (around $75-90ish around me). And it is fantastic. I think it‚Äôs my favorite Islay after lag 16
> the ppm thing is junk and in no way gives an accurate representation of how peaty or smoky a whiskey will taste. It can give you an idea, but it's far from being accurate.

Agreed.

OP, see the linked article *An Intro to Peated Whiskies* in the right sidebar of this sub, which I think has held up well considering how long ago it was written.

One thing I hope you will take away from it is that heavily peated scotches are not at all monolithic in their flavor profiles, instead there is a lot of diversity which tends to get lost when we collectively descriibe  them as ""smokey"" or ""peaty"". 

Laphroaig in particular tends to my taste to be more strongly medicinal (iodine notes) in character than some others and also has a distinctive THC-like funk to it. That I think, rather than the overall level of peatiness, has given it a perhaps undeserved reputation as a particularly aggressive peated scotch and more challenging for newcommers.

But if you are really liking Lagavulin 16, then you are already swimming in the heavily peated end of the swimming pool so to speak, and the ppms on other malts should not be a source of trepidation for you.

Good luck!
Ive heard about this one too, sounds very interesting. Thanks!
Ill check it out, thanks!"
Some Redbreast comparisons.,"So my flight tonight was Redbreast. I had a Redbreast 12 80 proof, Redbreast 12 Cask Strength 112.8 proof (I‚Äôm pretty sure, they‚Äôve already took the bottle away so I might be a few points off, lol) and Redbreast 15.

Redbreast 12 is absolutely fantastic! It‚Äôs everything it‚Äôs cracked up to be. The quintessential Irish whisky. Shortbread, honey, cooking spice, and a bit of cinnamon on the nose. Transfers to palate seamlessly. Very sweet and with a little bit of floral note on the back end.

12 CS is everything the basic 12 is but more pungent. Same good shortbread, honey, and cooking spices on the nose but now add a pretty noticeable chocolate scent on top of that. The nose moves right along into the palate. The chocolate is actually quite a bit more prominent than I expected, but all in all it‚Äôs very sweet. With very little burn compared to other whiskeys of its proof.

Redbreast 15. The extra 3 years made quite a bit of difference here. On the nose is some shortbread and honey like the other two but then there‚Äôs a very powerful fruitiness that overtakes the other notes. The palate is fruitiness up front but he back end sweetens out into honey. It‚Äôs also just generally a bit more floral and on top of that I can taste whatever barrel they used but only at the very beginning then it‚Äôs generally drowned out by everything else.

Because it‚Äôs ~$50 cheaper than the others I think the original 12 is the clear winner. I just don‚Äôt feel like what you get from the other two is quite worth nearly double the price. But if price wasn‚Äôt a deal than I‚Äôd say the Cask Strength wash favorite, and I‚Äôm not proof hound. The flavors in it just really exemplify what I want from an Irish whisky.

All in all you really can‚Äôt go wrong with any of them.","Shocked to read that the 12 CS is double the price of the regular 12 where you‚Äôre at.
Assuming the bottle in the picture is the same one, your Cask Strength was B1/21 (Batch 1, 2021).   Top left of label shows 56.3% (112.6 proof) so you had it right.

To date the highest ABV for RB12-CS was Batch 1 in 2013 at 59.9 %

Lowest ABV was 54.6, Batch 1 in 2019.    Batch 2 in 2019 was 55.8, the second lowest.   Not surprising, 2019 was the only year with two batches, so I guess they had to manage the casks a bit.

\*\*There may have been other years with a second batch, I've just never seen any bottles\*\*
12 is 60, CS is 100. At least that‚Äôs the lowest I‚Äôve found it.
Nice! Thanks for the info!
Wow. I think that is the going rate for it now but around here I can still find the 12 CS for 70, regular 12 has gone up to 60."
Old Forester 100,Picked this up today as my next new try. Really enjoying this one. It's a little more smokey on the finish than I usually like. But not off putting at all. Kind of like the taste you get in your mouth when sitting around a camp fire. And I have to say this is one of the first bourbons that I have been able to pick out a distinct taste note. I'm getting the banana that so many people say you get with OF. I even let my wine loving non bourbon drinking girlfriend have a sip and she picked it up too. I'm still not one that can pick up different scent notes.,"Love that bottle. Big flavor and a great price
Just a next day follow up. Enjoying another glass after yard work. This time I added a tiny bit of water. Took away the smokiness and really brought out the flavor. First time water has made a difference to me."
"Really, I just wanted the regular $35 bottle‚Ä¶then they gave me a sample of this‚Ä¶.",,"Who the fuck found out what damp embers taste like

Never have come across this one.  What‚Äôs MSRP?  The $35 bottle of Dragon‚Äôs Milk any good?  Cheers!
Ki da hard to find where I live but just got 4 bottles last week.  One of the best Bourbon I've ever tasted.
They are doing a lottery for a 10yr version starting on Monday.
I really wish they sold these in Florida.
I like New Holland brewery, and I like the textured bottle of this. Wish the distributed by me
You should read Ardgeg notes
This one was $90, limited release. Sounds like they do a few batches of these a year and they sell out pretty quickly. The regular bottle tasted great when I sampled. I‚Äôll get one next time we‚Äôre at the in-law‚Äôs
#ThingsIDontNeedToknow
Just googled them and maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not a scotch guy so maybe I‚Äôm a bit pessimistic. Give me a blend of coal, floral soapy note, and chilli and I just struggle to see the allure.
It just hits different. Plus, its nice to get away from cinnamon, brown sugar and oak lol"

Msrp: $74.99

Nose: Dark fruit, milk chocolate, light ethanol, vanilla,

Palate: Sweet creamy, chocolate, cherry, custard, tobacco, 

Finish: long, spicy, dry lots of oak without being overbearing. 

Overall: all 3 were absolutely fantastic pours. I got small samples of the BTAC bottles & wish I now had one of each. (Anyone want to donate one, I would be eternally grateful). Now the Elijah Craig C923 has been hailed as the whiskey of the year. And also GTS or WLW killer. From various reviewers online. I have never had any of the BTAC collection until now. Thanks to a fellow bourbon lover for those! I have had previous EC BP‚Äôs as well as Private Barrels. And they‚Äôve all been very good. I have been hunting for this C923 here in eastern NC, which has been impossible. From what I hear from employees, due to a bunch of counties north/west of hear ordering and receiving way to many from the state and so my area has never actually received any. Still yet to be seen, while those other counties have all sold out, with non left in the state warehouse! Yay! But again thanks to yet another bourbon lover I was able to swap a bottle for it (Weller OWA, another which I have never had, but I have a FP so figure it would worth the swap for me). After tasting all 3 back to back. It‚Äôs very tough to pick a clear winner. All had somewhat similar profiles. Funny thing is the EC & GTS share a closer mashbill (though the GTS is undisclosed). And yet I think it tastes more similar to the WLW. If I had to pick an order. And that‚Äôs tough. It would be 1st: WLW 2nd: Elijah Craig 3rd: GTS. All by slim margins. Each had their own unique to some extent. Each were very complex & flavorful & long lasting. The GTS mint to me was pretty prevalent and while I don‚Äôt mind that at all. It was probably the deciding factor in the order. The WLW seemed way lower that it should have tasted, probably due to the age of the bottle being opened for a while. The EC the highest of them all definitely had more spice/burn due to the higher proof & being a fresh bottle. But it still drank well under it‚Äôs 133 Proof.",Great comparison. Thanks for sharing!
Bought these two on a discount,"I bought these two bottles on a discount in supermarket, 40$ for two bottles after converting currency. I've had Johnnie Walker Black Label Sherry Finish before and enjoyed it - I seem to notice tasting notes like dried and red fruit, chocolate and spices better compared to other tasting notes in different whiskeys. I'm sure this Bushmills won't disappoint. One is for myself and I plan to gift the other to my friend for his birthday in January. Have you tried Black Bush? What do you think about whisky finished in sherry casks?",
First time having MWD this summer and had to order this year‚Äôs release. Loving it so far,,
This is an Advent Calender I can get behind,,
Searching for the perfect gift!,"Hi you whiskey loving people :-)
I myself am not that skilled in whiskey taste and feel, so i am asking you guys. I am searching for the perfect christmas gift for my father, who told me he wants to have the ""West cork maritime release - virgin oak cask"", which i know he asked me because it's in a good price range. However, i'd like to gift him a better malt/ scotch/ whiskey with similar notes.
Maybe someone can help me choose? Thanks guys üòäü•É","You might look for some older Bushmills. I'm not a huge expert on single malt Irish whiskey, but they have a 16 year old three wood that's aged in Sherry, Port and Bourbon barrels. Looks really tasty to me.
Thank you, will definitely have a look! Cheers üòä"
Trying my bonded Rye together,"I enjoyed a bottle of Blanton‚Äôs and a bottle of EH Taylor with a grooms party a while back and preferred the EH Taylor. This made me think that I was partial to Rye. I grabbed some of the bonded Ryes that I had in the bar and tried to do some tastings. My findings:

All had a Rustoleum type smell to them. Like a fresh can of paint. 

Pinhook: if I had to call out a flavor note to this one I would say maybe buttery or nutty, maybe movie popcorn? It was the best of the three I think

Rittenhouse: this was fine. A bit more spice than the Pinhook maybe a caramel taste to it? But also less smooth of an experience. Definitely made my tongue pull back if I took too large a drink

Jack Daniels: this was the smoothest by far. Not much burn but also not much else. I didnt pick out anything really and was honestly boring. My least favorite I think. 

At the end I poured the remainder of the three over ice and enjoyed that quite a bit. Again, I‚Äôve never done something like this but it was enough fun to try again with other offerings.","See if u can find Sazerac Rye. Cheap, somewhat findable and a good substitution for EHT Rye.
Yeah I really like Pinhook rye.  We did a tasting at OF and really love their rye for the price but the person running the tasting recommended Pinhook and glad she did."
"Penelope, Fort Hamilton & Redwood Empire","Hmm, I saw these  bottles Fort Hamilton and Penelope while ago and‚Ä¶because I wasn‚Äôt able to see them anywhere else, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking how they taste, if they are worth or not‚Ä¶but, finally I decided buy. Support local distillery  even if they asking more than  competition‚Ä¶

Fort Hamilton $98 it‚Äôs some king experimental with nice proof 110.8 and 6 years old but finished in maple cask which talks to me like Widow Jane Decadence which is awesome. 

Penelope Barrel Strenght  is  9 years old and 109 proof and for $79.99 when ‚Äúregular‚Äù without age statement $73
I had unopened Redwood Empire Lost Monarch $38 (I never tried) which I decided to open and  added  it to this set (why not!?).

And after first taste‚Ä¶
Redwood‚Ä¶sorry that wasn‚Äôt good idea to add it to others because the proof. If realy great bottle, but in this proof category can be classified as desert;) so let me pass it here (sorry)

On nose‚Ä¶FH no1. proof, hits you first and then spaces, also from rye mash, but rye hit my nose very nice (I like ryes and hight proofs, maybe that way) with tint of oak and they excel and are in my palette for 100%  compare to Penelope which is more subtle and sweet what surprised me, because proof is almost the same! Maybe because age?

Taste‚Ä¶FH has character! Match with nose which  is long and all spices on the tongue holds me  to the long end and this is what I like! when nose fallows taste. Here is power but gentle maple sweetness is here as well. 

Penelope‚Ä¶sweetness with vanilla, carmel  some fruits going on around ‚Ä¶super pleasant!
Is great if someone likes more smooth, sweeter  and I have to say nicely balanced liquor. Great bottle 

Finally‚Ä¶.
Age statement makes difference here, but also mash bill as well. 
They are different and I like a lot of‚Ä¶both!
Very unique and depends on mud, I will grab on or the other. 
But I think Penelope will be more pleasant  because is more smooth, sweet, carmel, vanilla , proof which I can‚Äôt really say until I will see on the label. Is wort that money!!

Fort Hamilton‚Ä¶.yes  is more $$$ but without tasting, trying different bottles and comparing them each other, I will never be able to explore more and be able to say what I like more or less. 
Plus ‚Ä¶we have to give a chance local places to explore and delivery something new to us. So I will plan a stop at For Hamilton Distillery for sure. 
And as side note,  place like NYC which is expensive in any direction, I understand why we have to pay more for products made and storage here. Comparing to open land in‚Ä¶TN or KY to NYC‚Ä¶sorry we can‚Äôt. Here every square inch has a value‚Ä¶and storage barrels by xx years = more money.","How is the Penelope 9 year? I loved the normal barrel strength!
Need a Redwood Cask Strength for a proper comparison
I can‚Äôt tell anything about normal BS because I not tried it. For couple bucks more I decided to grab 9y which is delicious"
GUIDE: A Path to Whiskey. Tips for New Connoisseurs," Hello fellow Redditors!

As promised, I am presenting you this quick guide on how to pick and taste whisky, as well as answering common questions. Enjoy and feel free to ask me anything! 

**Part One. A \*very\* short introduction: what is whisky and how it differs from other hard liquor. Types of whisky that exist**

Simply put, whisky is made from grain, corn for American whisky, or in case of malts, barley. Water and yeast are added to help with the process. Other alternatives are possible but rare. There is a lot of information on how the exact process works, but I shouldn‚Äôt tire you with the details; after all, this guide is meant to be short and practical.

What you need to know is three key whisky products exist. If we are talking about Scotch whiskies, those are:

¬∑ Single malt whisky;

¬∑ Single grain whisky;

¬∑ Blended whisky, which can consist of both grain and malt whiskies, or only grain ones, or only malt ones.

In case of bourbon, in the USA all bourbon whiskies 51% of mash bill (which is essentially the ‚Äúcooking pot‚Äù) must be corn, and the other grains can be any mix of wheat, rye or barley. Besides Scotland and USA, other places produce some great whisky, most importantly Ireland and Japan, which, together with the above, constitute the ‚ÄúBig Four‚Äù. Countries like Australia, Israel, France, Canada, India also make some great drams (which is, in short, a slang word for whisky) but those are, of course, less common and the ‚ÄúBig Four‚Äù.

Whisky can also be of different % alcohol volume. The commonly accepted minimum is 40%, as in case with many hard liquors, but many releases can easily reach up to 70%, which is especially true in case of ‚Äúcask strength‚Äù. I.e., 40% releases have water added to them to reduce the alcoholic strength, and while this makes drinking and understanding whisky easier, it often damages the deeper nose (‚Äúaroma‚Äù), palate (‚Äútaste‚Äù) and finish (‚Äúaftertaste‚Äù) notes that stronger releases have.

**Part one FAQ**

Q: Which type of whisky is best?

A: There is no correct answer to that. Generally, it is believed that malt whiskies develop better than grain ones, and typically grain ones do not get similarly expensive as they age. However, there are multiple factors that influence the cost of a bottle, more on that can be found further in the guide.

Q: What is the key difference in taste between scotch and bourbon?

A: In general, bourbon has a specific taste profile which is influenced by the presence of corn in the mash bill and has a more recognizable palate. Scotch whiskies offer more variety, majorly influenced by factors such as peat and presence of chill filtering. 

Q: What are the main styles of scotch whisky?

A: I would highlight the present of peat as the key factor. Islay whiskies like Caol Ila, Bowmore, Lagavullin, Laphroaig, Talisker have clear peated profile, sometimes with a distinct ‚Äúsea‚Äù taste. Highland or Speyside whiskies like Macallan, Balvenie, Singleton, Glenfiddich, Benriach have a softer, more vanilla-honey profile, but that highly depends on the release. Blended whiskies like Chivas, Johnnie Walker, Dewars may have different profile depending on the specific drams used in the production of that exact bottle.

**Part Two. Choosing a bottle**

So, you decided to try some whisky. Whether you are going to buy one in a shop or trying some *aqua vitae* in a bar, you need to pick what you want to try. Depending on your place of residence, different drams will be available, but I‚Äôll mostly focus on scotch whisky. If you try your first scotches, I highly recommend going with basic level international releases like:

¬∑ Macallan 12 years old

¬∑ Johnnie Walker Black Label

¬∑ Chivas 12 years old

¬∑ Talisker 10 years old

¬∑ Lagavulin 16 years old

You can always pick more expensive releases if you are ready to splurge, but don‚Äôt go too high early as you will encounter complex, less ‚Äúpolished‚Äù whiskies with bright distinctive features you might not be able to understand. The five releases I mentioned above are very well balanced and created to be understandable and enjoyable by as many people as possible; i.e. to fit most taste preferences. There are some expensive releases that are very well balanced for newer connoisseurs too, e.g.:

¬∑ Glenfiddich 30

¬∑ Royal Salute 21 Signature Blend

¬∑ Aberfeldy 21

¬∑ Caol Ila 25

¬∑ Arran 21

I also discourage going for cask strength whiskies as you start, as regardless of your previous experience with other types of alcohol, those releases are way harder to understand and, if picked on the lower end of the price spectrum, those 60%+ alcohol proof releases are often made just to be strong, not to be good. There are resources like Whiskybase that allow to dig deeper and see tasting notes and reviews, but at start I would recommend to just enjoy the dram you have in the glass.

I will also note that there are both official releases and private releases. Official release is made by the distillery itself, e.g., Mortlach released and marketed by the company owning Mortlach. Private releases are made by external, usually unaffiliated masters who bought a cask of whisky from Mortlach and aged it as they see fit. Typically, private releases can be found at cask strength, non-chill filtered and not coloured. 

**Part Two FAQ**

Q: Does the presentation (bottle, packaging) work as a good indicator of whisky quality?

A: No alcohol, besides may be cognac, relies so much on marketing and packaging presentation as whisky does. Private bottlers, e.g., usually don‚Äôt focus on external features as much, and a simple-looking bottle may easily cost thousands of dollars. But at more basic level, for someone who does not have a deep understanding of what he wants from whisky, packaging is a good indicator of quality. Distilleries packaging scotch will typically make most newbie-friendly releases look quite shiny for the price and it is a reasonable indicator that you will enjoy the dram without needing to analyze it too deeply.

Q: Are single malt whiskies better than blended ones?

A: No and again, no. The ‚Äúdomination‚Äù of single malt whiskies as something superior is a result of a well-planned, aggressive marketing campaign started by owners of major Highland/Speyside distilleries a few decades ago as an attempt to push the positions of Chivas, Dewars and Johnnie Walker on the international market, and it worked to an extent. There are a lot of bad blends but sometimes you can a great bottle for a price way lower than a comparable single malt would have. There are also great and very expensive blends that put many a single malt to shame. However, blended whisky producers have also created counter-marketing strategies and in many cases most of the price you pay for the bottle is the bottle itself, not the value of the spirits in the bottle.

Q: Are single grain whiskies worth drinking?

A: Generally, yes, however the ‚Äúfailure ratio‚Äù among single grains is way higher than among malts. Grain makes for a strong, somewhat rough base for whisky, and grain spirits age way slower than malts do. I would advice trying softer versions, like Cameronbridge 30+ years old or Royal Salute Snow Polo Edition which is a blend made only of grains, unlike other Chivas releases which focus on malt. I consider grain whiskies to be on a more expert level but, of course, try and see for yourself!

Q: What whiskies are overpriced and which have better cost-to-quality ratio?

A: It is not an easy question as tastes vary and prices differ significantly between countries and releases, however I can name Macallan 18 as probably the most overpriced scotch in middle price range. It is a good dram, for sure, but not worth what they ask for it now. Also, I can name Chivas 25 and almost all of Diageo Special Releases as overpriced. Aberfeldy, Glenfarclas and Ardbeg typically are worth more than you pay for them at lower-to-mid range. However, once you start going above 500-600 USD a bottle in many cases the situation changes, so its often a try, fail, repeat process.

Q: At what price tag the difference in quality of dram becomes insignificant and it becomes a matter of preferences?

A: While there is no direct answer, I would say that after the age of 21 years whiskies become more of a preference than quality. Of course, the difference between Balvenie 21 and 30 is great, but it way less than between Balvenie 12 or Balvenie 21. Many friends that I made tastings for never noticed the major difference between 25 and 40 years old Bunnahabhain when I poured it in a blind way. Some releases of 21 Royal Salute are arguably more interesting than 62 Gun that is at least 40 years old and like 10x in price. However, status of the bottle gives its own ‚Äòtaste‚Äù and varies in importance depending on personal worldview, but for many people the fact that they are drinking some 30 years old Bowmore is more important than the fact whether they even like such a peated whisky.

**Part Three. What influences taste and price?**

There are several factors that influence the taste of whisky. Those are the distillery, formula aka style used by the master blender, and age. Here I will go a bit into creation process. Prior to ‚Äúmaturation‚Äù, a drink that one day shall become whisky is produced using malt and water. This mixture goes through a fermentation process and is then distilled in copper pot stills. The outcome of this distillation is a clear liquid that barely resembles the whisky familiar to us. For it to transform into the whisky we know, this spirit needs to go through a ‚Äúmaturation‚Äù process. While pot-stills have some effect on the distilled spirit, to become whisky the ‚Äúbeverage‚Äù needs to be aged in casks.

Most typical casks are either first-fill oak casks or ex-bourbon casks. Some whiskies age in different casks, but they usually start to age in any of those two. Then, certain whiskies get a ‚Äúfinish‚Äù in port wine casks, madeira casks, sherry casks, red wine casks or something more exotic like ex-calvados, ex-sauternes or other casks. The quality, age, type and size of casks, be it hogsheads, butts, barrels or quarter casks, significantly affect both the taste and the price of whisky.

Creating whisky is not an easy process and that difficulty increases with age. There is a term called ‚Äúangel‚Äôs share‚Äù which means how much whisky vaporizes during the aging process. That share increases with the time the spirit spends in a bottle and also varies by production region/distillery. 

After about thirty years, the effect of cask and angel‚Äôs share increase significantly and that is one of the reasons why 30+ years old whiskies tend to rise in price \*that\* greatly. 

Area of production plays a huge role too. It influences the amount of peat, the distinctive features, and other elements of the dram. Different distilleries use different types of grain and barley.

Besides reasons relating to production, price is significantly influenced ‚Äì like all other products ‚Äì by marketing, distillery‚Äôs reputation, place of sale, and packaging. But enough with production and economics, let‚Äôs get to the most important part of why we are here‚Ä¶

**Part Four. Tasting your dram**

As you might have heard, there are three main ways to drink whisky: neat, with a drop of water or on the rocks, which means adding ice. There is no correct way and ultimately is about how YOU like it, however, if you want to **taste** the drink I recommend ditching ice and either trying it neat or with a drop of H2O. Water helps uncover the aroma and taste profile, however it will not save a bad scotch or bourbon and might as well make the flaws more notable. Do not add a lot of water as your goal is not to make whisky less strong but rather initiate a chemical reaction that ‚Äúopens‚Äù its profile.

Type of glass is important too. Whisky is typically consumed from rocks glasses, also called the old fashioned, or tumbler, glasses. This is a decent choice; however, the aromas are better presented in a glass which is shaped like an elongated egg or tulip, which includes glencairn and snifter glasses. Some very strangely shaped glasses are sometimes used in bars and hotels, however this choice is about presentation rather than helping you taste the drink better; ask for a classic option. Higher-end brands like Baccarat, Christofle, Lalique make exceptional glass and crystal but are focused more on great looks rather than necessary shape, so don‚Äôt overspend unnecessarily. The likes of Spiegelau, Riedel, Luigi Borelli and other more tasting-focused brands typically used by good restaurants/bars are a preferrable tasting choice unless you clearly understand how you like your tasting process to go. An experienced connoisseur could drink whisky from a tea cup and taste it well but that requires a lot of trial and error history formed during the years.

The design of the glass is considered crucial in aroma analysis for a reason. An essential feature of the ‚Äútulip‚Äù is the stem, which varies in length. Its purpose is to keep the nose away from the taster's hand, which may carry various odors that could interfere with the scent analysis of the whisky. Moreover, since our hands are typically around 37 degrees Celsius, holding the glass by the bowl can lead to overheating the whisky. This excessive heat can cause the alcohol to evaporate too quickly, altering the tasting experience. Therefore, it's important to always hold the glass by the base of the stem, not the bowl, same as with wine!

If you are tasting yourself, pour a reasonable amount into your glass. If you are using a glencairn/tulip, you should fill between a quarter and a third of the glass, a good indicator is to stop just after the ‚Äúfat‚Äù part of your glass starts to narrow down. Swirl it in your hand a bit, inhale the flavours. Sometimes putting your hand over a glass and giving it a shake is suggested, but I highly discourage you from doing this as unnecessary and weird. Begin by softly inhaling through your mouth, sealing your lips afterward, and then exhaling leisurely through your nose.

Initially, this might seem quite unusual, but it becomes intuitive quickly and you will adapt this approach to fit personal preferences and your style of drinking. Reflect on various scents and tastes you've encountered before, like fruits, bakery items, or earthy, woody, and toasted nuances. As you savor your whisky, attempt to connect these aromas and flavors with your past experiences. Sometimes you'll notice familiarities, while at other times, the aroma might be unique, unrecognizable, or simply distinct.

Is that chocolate and dried raspberry? Or maybe you notice something unexpected like coal-gas, green-house, medicine, rubber or even a distant note of shoe sweat (hopefully not, though, but who I am to judge)? After you smelled the desired amount of soul out of your dram, move on to trying it. Take a slow sip of the whisky while inhaling deeply and attentively. Observe the scents emerging from the glass. Let the whisky glide across your tongue and throughout your mouth. Identify any aromas and taste profiles you can; they may appear and disappear swiftly, but the most intense flavors are often the most memorable. Swirl the dram in your mouth, try to catch everything. If whisky appears too strong when you take a first sip, collect a bit of saliva and make another attempt. Enjoy the process, take pauses as you like.

After you finished your sip, attempt to catch the ‚Äúaftertaste‚Äù, commonly called the finish. Is it long-lasting or did your scotch or bourbon experience prove swift, like a massive summer rain? If you want to try yourself as a whisky expert, you may rate each of three criteria ‚Äì nose, palate and finish ‚Äì from 0 to 100. The final result is the average of all three. Anything above 85 is considered an excellent dram, and only the best of the best get 90+.

**Part Four FAQ**

Q: How many whiskies is it worth tasting in one evening?

A: Depends on personal experience and how good you are with alcohol in general, but I recommend not tasting more than five as after that you will be losing the subtler notes no matter your alcohol tolerance. After that, the bottles are large for a reason, drink ‚Äòem!

Q: Is blind tasting worth it for newbies?

A: Yes, however I wouldn‚Äôt place an emphasis on it. All my tips are intended to make your experience better, not overcomplicate it. 

**Some things to consider‚Ä¶**

¬∑ Do not mass buy bottles you like. Try new things! If you like a specific distillery, try private releases! Those will give you a fresh look on a drink well known.

¬∑ Do not break the bank trying to taste one highly expensive bottle you can‚Äôt normally afford. Chances are, you won‚Äôt be impressed that much and could as well end up disappointed as the experience will not match your very high expectations.

¬∑ While whisky can be an investment, unless you are really good with understanding the market, you will probably not earn much at all if anything. Whisky, after all, is the water of life, not your money tree ‚Äì treat it as a way to have fun and enjoy life.

¬∑ The only pairing I would recommend with whisky is a good cigar. Food ruins it.

¬∑ Cheers!","Thank you for this fantastic FAQ. You answered many of my burning questions.

EHT Batching Question,"Dumb question‚Ä¶ but here it goes. 

Basic small batch EHT‚Ä¶ is there a way to determine batches? I know the ink on the tube varies amongst bottles, but any other way to tell bottles apart? 

I have a bottle open, it tastes horrible. On my 5th -6th pour, open a month plus. Terrible. 

We went to the BT distillery a few weeks ago, we all brought home EHT. Had my neighbors bottle of that a few nights ago for our trip, wildly different. The cherry cola notes, tasted like heaven. Life changing almost. 

My lovely wife mixed my bottle in with 3 other backups. So I have no idea which one it is. 

Hail Mary here.","Can tell generally by the laser code on the bottle. LYYDDD‚Ä¶ how many batches they do in one day. No idea
Absolutely fantastic! Would have never seen those markings 

#1 - 22354 - almost looks counterfit on the laser etching Compared to other 2. Shitty tasting. 

#2 L23186 - bought this 3 weeks after #1. Same store who moves tons of product. 

#3 and likely the bottle from the distillery - L23283. Bottle would have been a little over 2 weeks old, so makes sense.
So you will see some variation between 2022, and earlier, markings and 2023. Mix of etched and ink marked. It‚Äôs strange the variation but, generally, if it‚Äôs not a single barrel store pick, it‚Äôs on the bottle.
I just checked my single barrel store pick and the coding holds up. Starts with L23..."
I am wondering If japanese Whiskey is worth a try for me,"I want to buy a nice bottle of Whiskey for myself for Christmas and go a little bit obove my usual Budget.
I have been drinking Whiskey for a few years now but i have never been good with identifying flavour profiles and tasting notes.


The bottles i enjoyed most so far seem to be pretty balanced and i have read that japanese Whiskeys are more on the lighter fruitier side so i am not sure if its even worth a try or out of my Budget.


I really liked Benromach 10, Bowmore 15, Bunnahabhain 12, Auchentoshan 12 and Talisker 10. Wanted to spend around 100‚Ç¨.","Japanese whiskey was definitely heavily influenced by scotch. That's less evident in the market today than years past but still pretty dominant. If you like scotch you'll probably also like Japanese whiskey. The trouble with Japanese whiskey is it blew up and so did the prices. There are good reasonable options (Nikka Coffee, etc) but to me it feels a bit of a crapshoot outside of the now VERY expensive classics.

All that being said, I'm not sure I've had a bad Japanese whiskey and the good ones are great. I think it's worth trying, certainly, just be ready for price shock.
If you‚Äôre travelling, you can look out for Miyagikyo Grande and Yoichi Grande. I personally feel these are the best for your buck
Fuji single grain whisky is my favorite for $99
You only live once, why not enjoy it?   I like Hakushu and Yamazaki quite a bit.   Their prices do hurt though (because I remember what they cost not too long ago). Worth an occasional splurge though.
Nikka from the barrel is really good and gives me more of something like scotch. And nikka coffey grain is really good, more on the sweeter side. Hibiki is good as well!
The prices are part of the reason why i have waited this long, i was looking around a bit and saw a suntory hakushu  single malt for 99‚Ç¨ and a nikka miyagikyo for 80‚Ç¨ that got me interested.
Look up nikka FTB and the Ben Nevis thing.
Those are both quite good. Compared to US pricing, the Hakusho is a very good price. It's one of my favorite whiskeys. I have the Miyagikyo as well and it's quite nice."

There's not a lot of variety that I can see re straight corn whiskeys.
MGP has a 99/1
Barrel has an 8 year I believe. I hear it is good if you like it sweet.
Interesting, I'll look that up. Thanks."

Found my new cheap daily sipper,Picked up this bottle yesterday. One I've been wanting to try. It is very good. Surprisingly viscous for such an inexpensive bottle. Smooth with notes of cocoa and oak. Sorry not going to get into a formal review since I'm not one that can pick up 20 different nose and palate notes. I like what I like.,"**I like what I like.** The perfect review note and the only one that truly matters.

Sir, do you know our lord and savior old grand dad?
White label or jts brown should taste similar or better. Both are bottled in bond. But all three are more mixer quality to me.
Thank you. It doesn't have to have a eleventybillion different flavor notes to be enjoyable. This one just sits well with me.
LOL That's kind of funny in my own perspective. I don't have great memories of OGD or Jack. Chugging 5ths in my bedroom when I was a teenager. End results were never favorable. I stayed away from whiskey for the last nearly 40 years. So since I have started my bourbon journey many years later, after those days I have shyed away from anything with either of those on the label.
I have the BiB (white label) and it's good but it's a mixer for me. Much more thin than the 1783. I'm not saying the 1783 is the best thing I ever drank. But as an inexpensive sipper it fits the bill. Buffalo Trace would be my everyday sipper if it wasn't so hard to come by.
Understandable. Then perhaps you can be swayed to the church of our lord, MFC?
Agreed. I'm always saying I like 1783 better than EW BiB.
Sorry I'm not familiar with that acronym. Clue me in.
Ah it‚Äôs what Mellow Corn is called ‚ÄúMellow Fucking Corn‚Äù. It‚Äôs a meme it‚Äôs actually pretty mid.
I did a little search for MFC whiskey and kind of thought it was Mellow Corn. Ran across this review and I dunno. LOL

Abusive Relationship Whiskey,"Hi! Long time commenter first time poster. 
I have a question for everyone; what is your abusive Relationship whiskey? The whiskey you keep going back to and think it's gonna be good but it's just not. For me it's Koshu Pure Malt. A friend picked it up for me as a gift from Japan. I drink it and get some sweet carmel notes with the maltiness, and then the Dirty Socks taste hits me. I keep drinking it thinking it'll be good but it's not. What does everyone else think is their abusive Relationship whiskey.","Buffalo Trace. I've had one store pick bottle that was great. Every other time I've had it, I've been disappointed.

My one and only - Still Austin Cask Strength. It tasted *really young* when first opened. It's been a year now and that's mostly gone. This is one that will either take years to finish or be given away before then.
I‚Äôll do this with a single bottle up to about the halfway mark, at which point they tend to sit on the shelf for a long time.  The only bourbon I‚Äôve bought twice after regretting the first was Woodford DO.  I figured since everyone raved about it that maybe I had gotten a bad bottle.  Nope.  It‚Äôs just not for me.
Dickel 15. I want it to be good so bad I‚Äôve kind of convinced myself I like the vitamin notes.
10 yr SB Henry McKenna
I usually learn to dump it or put it out for a group rather than continuing to drink stuff I don‚Äôt like. Sucks dumping after spending money on it but it just collects dust
The Glenrothes. I think I *finally* learned my lesson after drinking the 18 with Coke and still struggled to force it down. Waste of good Mexicoke.
Old Forester Barrel Strength. the blue label. I love OF, but man it just usually drinks way too hot and I can't handle it at all. But the core flavors are good! but it's not good to drink.
Woodford Double Oaked.  Bought it because there are so many reviews and posts raving about it. Hated the neck pour. Hated the next two pours. And dreading the next. May just gift it to a friend.ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
A buddy gave me a bottle of Chattanooga Whiskey experimental batch 001 a couple months ago.  I think he‚Äôd bought a few when they came out many years ago.  The cork was a little questionable so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a factor but I‚Äôve been back to it three times now and my god.  Still a very cool gift I thought.
Ardbeg Committee releases...
Beauty on the outside keeps me buying them in hopes of something special, but they all batter the wallet for something marginally better than the 10 yr at 3-4x the price.
Think gonna be good? Macallan 25. I am sorry...
EH Taylor Small Batch. I want to like it so much, but every time I have it, it is just awful.
Penelope anything. Their young four grain whiskey is trash
Nikka Coffey Grain
Heavens Door Double Barrel. It turned into an expensive mixer for me. Neat it just punched my throat every time I tried it. I try not to mix anything more than $30 since it defeats the purpose of enjoying the nuance of the whiskey.
Old Charter. It's a cheap workhorse.
Glenfarclas 12 is one for me. I bought it because my wine tasting group did a Speyside whiskey tasting and I found this one. It‚Äôs just a one dimensional Scotch that is way overpriced.
MWND. I know there‚Äôs better options but I keep finding it for msrp each year and buying it
Bulleit rye, either highball or on rocks...nothing great but hits hard all the same
Any Glenfiddich. I‚Äôve almost tried them all, and I‚Äôm not suggesting they‚Äôre all bad, I just have not enjoyed any of them at all.
Gave up on BT long time ago. Simply can't find it anywhere across 2 states (one control state, the other not). Too many good whiskies out there to obsess over any specific one.
When I first tried BT I thought it was a too sweet for a bourbon. Not enough balance.
Shits garbage
Ehh, it‚Äôs pretty good, just not at the price they charge.
I actually think Still Austin Cask is pretty good - probably cause I found it for $45. Would buy again.
Frankly I'd take it I really like it!
Second this!
I like the glenrothes, but I'm a whore for unpeated sherry casks scotch, and I think it's a little young, still good to me tho.
Agreed. They are so unbalanced it‚Äôs crazy. I don‚Äôt understand how people like them
I agree, got one from Costco a few weeks back and it‚Äôs soooo hot neat! I found I like the flavors best after a little ice melt. May try it in an old fashioned soon.
I also hate it. Terrible stuff
I feel like this for anything Macallan, including the 25. So many people like it that I keep trying it thinking that I must be wrong but nope, I still don't like it. I gave the rest of my bottle of Macallan 25 to a friend because I knew I'd never finish it.
Was going to post the same for the Single Barrell I have. Was so excited to find one in the wild at MSRP but it just tastes like permanent marker!
Agree. Bought two bottles. A toasted and barrel strength and all you get on nose and palette is methanol. Very disappointing.
It's plentiful here (New Orleans) and usually between $22 - $25, and I also gave up on it. Sazarac Rye is like $20 and they have cases of it sitting around stores.
I realize my opinion is way outside of the norm on this bottle, as many truly do enjoy it.
It‚Äôs too inconsistent.
the BS ryes are super good on the other hand, but literally unfindable. I find 5 bottles of Stagg before I see one of those.
I liked it with a cigar, and it made an absolutely killer split base rye / bourbon Sazerac or Old Fashioned. But straight and neat it just didn't really work for me.
Some SiBs I had from EHT were sadly super bad. Mostly store picks (somehow). The regular SIBs are amazing.

Review: The worst 'whisky' in the world - Bolanachi Hydelands Red,"&#x200B;

[JW Red is not the worst Red Label.](https://preview.redd.it/tt4holslyzyb1.jpg?width=2251&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e50b84f5ca259546d9c60da5b41a526b31e1c1f)

A family trip to Makadi Bay in Egypt (a gorgeous place) meant a chance to indulge in plenty of low quality all-inclusive booze. Anyone who has experienced such a trip will know to keep expectations limited. However, some actually very good food and a selection of basic but recognisable blends behind the bar got my hopes up. 

Unfortunately, it transpired that those branded whiskies were not part of the all-inclusive package and cost more. A lot more. It's fair to assume if they bother stocking them then there must be someone willing to pay ‚Ç¨27 for a Ballentines or ‚Ç¨35 for a JW Black, but I have neither the budget or desire to be one of them.

So instead I settled for the house whisky: Bolanachi Hydelands Red.

As soon as I tried the stuff, it became apparent this is exceptionally poor. A quick Google found a Whiskybase list of the '100 Worst Whiskies', and with the sheer quality shining through, Bolanachi's Red Label topped the list.

I felt it to be my duty to share my review of this , so anyone debating a dram of this fluid is prepared and ready. Although let's be honest, who doesn't want to at least try the worst whisky in the world?

**Price:** All-inclusive!

**ABV:** Not sure, was in Arabic. Internet suggests 40%.

**Casks:** Presumptuous to assume any traditional whisky making processes were followed here.

Served in a random glass by a bartender who didn't know how to make the cocktails on the menu.

Rested for 20 minutes. Mostly due to having to mental psych myself up. Drank over the course of 40 minutes to allow myself to truly question why I was doing this.

**Nose:** Strong pine. Hint of lemon, smells of chemicals and quite herbal with some aniseed present. Nothing that would make you think this is whisky. Just a very faint note of maple and something that suggests milk chocolate. Also a bit of burnt plastic.

**Palate:** Lemon rind and more pine absolutely dominate along with an unwelcome bitterness. Some light coconut just about detectable

**Finish:** Regret and cheap air-freshener. Pine paired with liquids which have warning labels. Flavour does last but it's hard to argue this is a positive.

It is ranked as the worst whisky in the world. I can't confirm whether this is accurate or not. But it is certainly the worst thing I have ever drunk. Even worse than the Pepperami smoothy I for some reason willingly drank as a student.

Most cheap whiskies I've tried have tended to be notable due to a lack of taste, blended to be bland, inoffensive liquids which taste vaguely of whisky flavours. This is not like that. It cannot be said that this lacks flavour or is bland, it has quite a few different notes, however all of them are unpleasant and clash like the proverbial sack of cats.

You could actually argue there is almost a (limited) degree of complexity here, with some mouthfuls hinting at some subtler flavours. But they are utterly dominated by stronger, prominent tastes reminiscent of blended common supermarket toilet cleaners.

But the most shocking thing about this is that it's meant to be a whisky. If you did a blind taste you'd think it was some bizarre North European herbal liquor intended only to prank tourists.

But apparently it is an Egyptian whisky, intended only to prank tourists.

Don't drink this.

**Potential SMWS name:** Domestos Lemon Christmas Tree

Note: After writing this review I realised the words 'style' are included in small print on the label. Whatever the whisky regs are in Egypt, it doesn't meet them so it can be argued it technically isn't a whisky. But sod it, I willingly drank a second glass of this to review it so I'm posting it anyway.","Thank you for your service lmao
I checked your profile to find other bad whiskey you have reviewed.

Was sorely disappointed.  

You may have discovered your calling.  I eagerly await reading about the next travesty you are forced consume!"
Whiskey & BBQ with my brothers,,
Special (Reserve) Treat,"Another basic review from a basic man. This is my second Weller purchase (have tried and very much enjoyed the Antique 107). 

On the nose I I got fresh cut grass and mint with a caramel sauce with fruit.

Taste, is a punchy ethanol on the first sip that gave way to sharp sweetness and a slow burn of oak, it reminds me of a Glenlivet Caribbean cask near the end. 

Have to say this is another winner from Buffalo Trace and another bottle I‚Äôll happily enjoy (sparingly).","I enjoy it sparingly because it's average at best. I certainly wouldn't drink it over the bottles you have in the background. I get straight sugar sweetness/vanilla/ethanol and a little bit of wood that reminds me of the smell of fresh cut lumber(2x4s). OK if you can get it cheap(around $30). More than that and it's a hard pass.
Oh tonight I‚Äôm opening the Bardstowns, looking forward to that. The reason it won‚Äôt be drunk quickly is I can only buy it at secondary prices in the UK as it‚Äôs not available at retail. I had the 107 after and it‚Äôs far superior.
The Bardstown BiB is especially good. Agree that the 107 is far superior. Enjoy
The BiB is the first one I‚Äôll be trying tonight. I will have a double on your recommendation."
Michters 10 Bourbon x3. 23A vs 23D vs 2020,"Doing the M10B comparison x3. 23A vs 23D vs 2020 M10. Just look at the colors and you can tell which one is the 2020 lol. 

My Thoughts (a quick comparison, sorry if you‚Äôre looking for some tasting notes porn‚Ä¶ thats not this lol) 

Predictable that the 2020 drinks younger, thinner and sweeter than the two 23s. For the 23s, the A wins the nose by a decent amount, but the D still has a much deeper more vivid nose than the 2020. 

On the palate tho, I find the 23A more dry and oaky, whereas the 23D is notably sweeter while still having most of the oaky complexity of the 23A. I also get a bit more substantial of a finish from the 23D as well. 

If I had to guess the 2020 is right around 10 years old, the 23D is probly 14-15 years old, and the 23A is probably 17-18 years old. Personally I prefer the 23D overall because while I love some old oak I‚Äôm generally not a fan of trading too much sweetness for it. The 23A for me is more on the same line of how I felt about Pappy 20‚Ä¶ amazing nose but the palate is a bit too woody for me‚Ä¶ I like a little more balance between tannic oak and sweetness and the 23D offers that‚Ä¶. The nose on that 23A tho ü•∞

I really enjoy all 3 of these pours tho. The point here was to split hairs between them. No shade on the 2020 M10, but these 23s definitely are a higher caliber as far as being a special occasion sort of whiskey. I really hope Michters stays on this track with future M10s.","I‚Äôve heard these are likely over 10 years, but 18 years feels like quite the stretch, especially when the 20 year sells for thousands of dollars. Any source that these could be that old?
Been to a Michters tasting this week- don‚Äôt think they make a bad bottle!
What‚Äôs the msrp on the 10 year?
I have a 23E. I was definitely good and complex, but I was surprised to find a pretty distinctive brine/umami note. Just caught me off guard, did you notice anything like this?
Yes. The Mash and Drum interview with Michters MD. They basically confirmed it‚Äôs at least in the range of 15-16 years but he wouldn‚Äôt get specific. 

I‚Äôm estimating the years I am based off my own experiences with other Bourbons of those age ranges. The 17-18 year range seems to be where the tradeoff between sweetness and tannic oak really starts to occur like in EC18 or Pappy 20 I‚Äôve had, whereas the balance I find in 23D is reminiscent of other 14-15yr drams I‚Äôve had like Pappy 15. 

Age isn‚Äôt just age tho, it all depends on how a barrel was aged, and the temperature swings it experienced during that time. Just because 23A may be 18 years old doesn‚Äôt mean it approaches the experience you get from an M20, which is at barrel strength and the process of aging will be approached quite differently for whiskey thats going to spend at least 20 years in a barrel rather than at least 10 years. 

So I definitely could be off, maybe 23A is 15 and 23D is 13. But we know the 2020 is at least 10 years old, and the difference between that and the 23D and 23A is most closely reminiscent to the differences I‚Äôve experienced between Old Rip Van Winkle, Pappy 15, and Pappy 20, respectively. So that is why I‚Äôm estimating the age ranges I am.
Agreed
I think $180 now
Not that I would describe as brine. But the 23A did have some bitterness to it."
Woodford Reserve MC Sonoma Triple finish,"Here goes my best at trying to describe the smell and taste. 

The smell is super sweet like a candy of some kind. There‚Äôs notes of fruit and a little vanilla. 

On the palate it taste just like it smells. There‚Äôs lots of fruit with a small hint of oak. It was pretty sweet with a little spice.

The smell and taste is almost what I thought It was going to be base on the wine barrel finish. 

My only complaint was the finish was not long at all. It came and went really quickly and didn‚Äôt linger for too long.  

I did think it was good but at $160 that I paid for I wouldn‚Äôt pick one up again. I have tried the 18 series before and I prefer that one instead.",Thanks for the review!  I just saw this at the store for the same price and passed.  They also had the batch proof which I did get also at $160.  Haven‚Äôt tried it yet but will this evening.  Cheers!
Trying to decide on a MM Private Selection,"So I went for a tasting of Makers Mark Private Selection last week. Enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. It's the first pic. I was looking on Total Wine and they have three different versions. Now I'm trying to decide which one would be the best flavor profile. I think I've eliminated 1-2-1-2-4 because it sounds like it would be super oaky and spicy. Leaning towards 6-2-2-0-0 because it sounds like it would be on the sweeter side. But I'm open to suggestions from those more experienced than myself. 


Here are the stave profiles:

1) Baked American Pure 2 (BP):  Baked American Pure is American oak that's slowly toasted. BP, or Baked American Pure, is made from American oak and is the first stave sampled in the program. It adds notes of brown sugar, vanilla, caramel and spice.

2) Seared French Cuv√©e (Cu):  Next in order is Cu, also known as Seared French Cuv√©e. Cu is made from French oak that's ridge-cut and seared with infrared heat. It imparts toasty notes of oak and caramel.

3) Makers 46 Stave (46):  The Maker's Mark 46 stave is the one that started this whole experiment. It's made from seared French oak and delivers dried fruit, vanilla and spice. A barrel fitted with 10 of these staves would give you a cask-strength version of Maker's Mark 46.

 
4b) Roasted French Mendiant (Mn) (began Feb 2021):  Roasted French Mendiant is French oak cooked on low in a convection oven. It adds pleasant traces of milk chocolate, nuts, and dried dark fruit.

5) Toasted French Spice (Sp):  Toasted French Spice is a French oak stave, toasted at first high heat then at low temperatures in a convection oven. This stave has a flavor profile of smoke, coumarin and spice.","Just pick the one you like the sound of. You‚Äôre dangerously over thinking this.
Total Wine ""picks"" are notorious for sucking and letting you down. Beware friend
Honestly I would take 46 cask strength over these ones. None of them are bad its just cask strength is better in my opinion
This is purely a matter of personal taste, but of the MM Private Selections I've tried, the ones I liked the best had a preponderance of either:

Baked American Pure - which seems to be correlated with flavors which are lighter and brighter in personality, sometimes with citrus notes

Some combination of one or more of: Seared French Cuvee, Roasted French, and Toasted French - a combo I've nicknamed *The French Connection*. These tend to have a darker & more spicy flavor profile, often featuring notes of chocolate and/or coffee. While the latter may sound oaky, to my taste it plays off nicely vs. the sweeter character of the basic MM profile and gives more complexity to the bourbon.

The M46 stave hasn't stood out much in the MM PS bottles, in my experience. If I really want that profile, there is always Makers 46.

Aside from drinking (to my taste) a bit young & hot for their proof, I have not had a bad MM PS bottling yet, so I think you should be in pretty good shape regardless of what combo you pick.
I say the honeysuckle.


I try to avoid picks that use all 5 staves, they always end up ""garbage brown"" in that no flavors really stick out. 3 staves seems to be the sweetspot for clear notes while maintaining creativity.


i personally dislike the baked American stave because it lightens things up too much.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, but if I'm paying 70 bucks I want some oomf.
So I own all three of those TW picks. And a couple more, but I‚Äôve only tried the Honeysuckle.  In short, I love it.  It‚Äôs a bit sweet, which is enhanced by the wheated nature, but it drinks below its proof and is a great dessert pour.  I actually bought two backups after I killed the first.  So that would be my recommendation.
I have a bottle with the same recipe as the first bottle, 13231, it‚Äôs decent. I got to help make a barrel a month ago, I‚Äôm waiting for our bottles to come in!
Did you get the one from Empire? I saw it the last time I was in there and was wondering how it was. I‚Äôm going there tomorrow to hopefully grab one.
LOL Overthinking is a bad habit of mine.
I'm not sure I'd say sucking... but I'm pretty sure they just take whatever they're given, they don't actually pick out their own barrels
Good to know
Funny you think it drinks hot. The first thing I thought at the tasting is it drank below its proof. Which I figure I would notice since I haven't really dabbled in higher proofs. 

And the reason I said I was surprised I liked it so much is because I really don't care for Makers 46. 

As the other guy said I just need to quit overthinking it. It's just a bit of money to spend on something I might end up not liking.
I'm real curious if there is a big difference between Honeysuckle and Golden Hour. Please report back how the two compare when you try GH.
I did not. But I'm seriously considering getting one since I did taste and like it.
Yes. Exactly my point. They don't pick anything. They're just dumped whatever no one else found choose worthy so at least lesser than. I don't bother with them any longer"
Brewzle pick Starlight Rum Barrel Finished,"I‚Äôve been watching Brewzle videos for a few months and the bottles I‚Äôve had in common with his reviews I‚Äôve quite enjoyed‚Ä¶ I took a chance on his recently released Starlight picks and decided to crack one tonight‚Ä¶ the rum finished bottle. 

This is my first ever taste of anything from Starlight so not sure what to expect and how the rum finish might change the experience but this will be a challenging bottle to get through! I kind of anticipated this being a sweeter expression for some reason but I get the rum overtones all through the sip and it doesn‚Äôt feel like it has added any complexity in taste or mouthfeel‚Ä¶ just overall not what I‚Äôm looking for.

I do also have the Starlight straight bourbon Brewzle pick, maybe I should have started there.","I had a rum finished starlight too and it was ok. Starlight is just too young and they cover the youthfulnesss up with finishes. Not my jam but not awful stuff either
I love Starlight, but I have skipped the rum finishes. I rarely come across a rum finish that I like. I have a lot of their stuff and I wouldn‚Äôt judge them as a whole based on that one bottle.
There are more barrel picks coming out of Starlight than non-barrel picks.  They are finishing everything any way they can and mark it $80-90.  That‚Äôs serious bourbon money.  I guess my $90 for ECBP C923 was not too bad compared to that.  Brewzle is going all out on picks.  He even did a Clyde Mayes.  I only give him a pass on that because I think they both are from Alabama.  I would buy a Brewzle pick though from the right distillery.
I bought the cigar and loved it
Do you have to be a patron member to get his picks? Starlight seems to be a popular store pick and always finished. I‚Äôve not had any for the reasons you gave. Seems justified.
The problem with finishing in rum barrels is that without specific provenance of the barrels being used, you don‚Äôt know exactly what you‚Äôre getting. 

Rum has virtually no specific requirements for what it can contain so unless it‚Äôs a barrel from Foursquare or a number of Jamaican distilleries you could be getting a barrel that has contained rum with added sugar.
OP, did you get the Crittenden rum finished rye? I found that one to be less sweet than Angel‚Äôs Envy rye.
I got the Starlight VDN Brewzle pick and think it's fantastic, but the sweet orange flavor of the orange wine really brings it home. If you were looking for sweeter, I would have tried that one. Although it did go fast
I am hoping the second bottle I snagged is better‚Ä¶ will crack that one soon and report back!
I like Starlight but agree it‚Äôs way overpriced. Would much rather have ECBP for the same price.
He has a Discord/email tier. I‚Äôve gotten my barrel pick bottles (Barrel bourbon, Starlight bourbon, Crittenden rum finished rye) from the email group. The Starlight bourbon is pretty good and less expensive than what you‚Äôd find in stores. I‚Äôm looking forward to the Thirteenth Colony and Frey Ranch picks.
Yes but he has free tier (that‚Äôs what I elected)‚Ä¶ he has some upcoming picks with thirteenth colony and others as well‚Ä¶ so might get better!
All I know is while drinking this glass  began getting a headache‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not for me.
I missed the Crittenden drops but have been watching for the next drops more diligently!
Yeah, I‚Äôm only in free tier and it was gone before I got in there!
I wasn‚Äôt going to order a bottle since I‚Äôm out of room on my whiskey shelves, but the video + small business thing got me. I had to buy a bottle to support a small business (and I love rye whiskey). lol"
Stranahan‚Äôs Experimental Series - Quick thoughts,"This is one of the first whiskeys I bought when I got started. Picked it up from the distillery for around $50/375 mL. Because of that (and the low volume) it has sat on the shelf for a while. But I finally tried it last night alongside a flight of my favorites and I think I might go pick up another now‚Ä¶

It may have just been the night, but this was my favorite out of the lineup. 

I tried it alongside the following, from low to high $$$: Old Grand Dad 114, Jack Daniel‚Äôs Bonded Whiskey, 1792 Full Proof Single Barrel Select (School House), Willet 4 Year Rye (Cask Strength), and Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (batch C923), and Stranahan‚Äôs 10 Year Mountain Angel.

Again, I think the Maple Cask from Stranahan‚Äôs was my favorite from them all. It had a lot of the same notes as the Mountain Angel 10 year, but more intense (I am thinking because of the >10% higher ABV). Those flavors to me are wintery/warm spices and fruit (apple + stone fruits, cinnamon, and other spices you might find in an apple pie.) 

However, there was also an entirely new layer thanks to the maple cask finish. Oddly enough I didn‚Äôt get too much of a maple flavor out of it. Instead, it was a stronger sweet profile that initially preceded the other flavors and was harder to pin down. The closest flavor in my thoughts is a high-end root beer, very natural tasting.

It was super smooth and left a nice warm sensation long after the sip. If you like whiskeys on the sweeter side then this is worth getting at the distillery if you ever visit and if it‚Äôs still available. For me and my cruder rating system it‚Äôs my first ‚Äú10/10‚Äù. I was seriously blown away by it.","To be clear, when I give it a 10/10, I‚Äôm just saying that it is the best Whiskey I have personally had and according to my taste. Given the ratings I‚Äôve seen given to much more expensive whiskeys, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not actually 10/10 on any legitimate scale (not sure if anything can be a 10/10 on, say, the t8ke scale)
I have that exact same bottle. Quite tasty, indeed. It‚Äôs great value, too, given how old it is, cask strength and of course the finishing process.
Is there an age statement I missed or did you ask them how old?
So I went back today and they are unfortunately sold out.. guy at the place said there is a good chance they will come out with it as an official product line down the road, but it might be some time before that happens‚Ä¶ sad days
Pretty sure it‚Äôs on that description card there
And you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs aged 9 years total"
My pickups the last few weeks. Found a couple new local stores,"Have a couple drinks of the lost monarch which I loved and found this.  Can‚Äôt wait to try it.  Paid $83 w/tax for the the pipe dream

Makers was recommended and I am currently enjoying.

Huge fan of bakers 7 and have never seen the 13 in the store. Couldn‚Äôt pass it up and paid $160 w/tax.
 
Cheersü•É","So I have had a few of the pipe dream.  Both really good bottles but I think I prefer the pipe dream because it‚Äôs less hot at the end.  I wouldn‚Äôt turn either of them down if I found them again.
Which do you prefer, the Lost Monarch or the Pipe Dream? Also, was the Lost Monarch the cask strength as well?
I haven‚Äôt drank the pipe dream yet so I will let you know.  Yes, both bottles are cask strength."
Best way to start expanding the pallet?,"I‚Äôve been a woodford reserve guy for a few months now and just recently started looking into the whiskey world further a few days ago and feel a bit overwhelmed. I would like to learn how to taste the finer notes of the whiskies first and foremost, because whenever I try to sniff really any whiskey for that matter they mostly smell the same, there is of course some variation in smells that I can pick up between say between Canadian whiskies and Jack, but otherwise it mostly just blends together, then I would also like to taste the notes without getting the alcohol toward taste the a lot of newbies have, I started to watch Brewzle on YouTube, and all of the faint notes and flavors he gets just seems impossible to me to get, any advice would be greatly appreciated","the higher the proof the more it will burn, so start out with the popular brands because they are proven then as you start to acclimate to the taste you can start to try other brands. Same way with bourbon...if the whisky is tuff on your pallet then put it on the rocks or start off with adding some mixer to it...slow and steady wins the race.
Practice, practice, practice.

You can also dilute whiskies so they don't burn so much. After a while (several bottles) you'll hopefully be able to discern the nuances, even after adding only little or even no water.
Like anything else, it takes time. There are quintessential flavor profiles for any whisk(e)y's. Once you can recognize the general tastes of Bourbon, Irish, Scotch by taste profile blind the palate is capable of finding the oak, orange, cherry, shortbread, fruit, floral, etc.  I still had trouble between Bourbons and Ryes - especially low rye rye's.

Try different whiskey's in the same profile - 

Bourbon: Wild Turkey 101 vs. Dickel 10 BiB  
Rye: Bulleit Straight Rye (95%) vs. Rittenhouse (51%)  
Scotch: Bunnahabhain 12  vs. Port Charlotte 10 year (Peated)

Everyone's palate is different. I may taste dusty spearmint in the Bulleit Rye, you may taste cut grass or dill. It's very subjective unless one is trained as a Whiskey Sommelier (yes there's such a thing.)
Interesting, I‚Äôve tried a few Ryes a little bit ago and I was quite fond of them, the flavors were especially smooth compared to other bourbons, one thing I‚Äôd like to try is scotch as I think I would like the flavors of it but would have to look for a (somewhat) affordable bottle, with good flavors"
Elijah Craig Barrel Proof C923 - an average Joe's review,"For context into what I typically like:  I mostly indulge in sub $40 bottles. Rarely indulge in $50 to $100 bottles. Love WT101 and Rare Breed (bourbon and rye), Four Roses Small Batch, Makers Mark 101, Barrel Seagrass (splurge). My favorite all time whiskey is Bunnahabhain 12 Cask Strength and Redbreast 12 Cask Strength (strange since I am a ""bourbon guy""). 

Here is my review of ECBP C923:

First taste (neck pour, let rest 15 minutes in Glencairn):

WOW! HOT. A hot unbalanced, thin mess. This surprised me because I wasn't getting it on the nose, which was pleasant and subdued vanilla and oak. I could get nothing but ethanol and cinnamon on the palate. I switched to a rocks glass to hopefully subdue the hotness, but it did not work. An Unpleasant burn,, and I typically love a nice lingering ""burn"". So, I shelved it for a few days, knowing I'd have to try again.

Tonight. Stemless small wine glass. First taste. BETTER. But still too hot. Cinnamon, some sugar, vanilla, but strong burning finish so I couldn't get any other nuanced notes and it still felt ""thin"".  I added a splash of water, and .... HOLY COW! A completely different experience! The dram became a wonderful viscous, rich, maple, vanilla, anise, baking spice, sugar cookie, silky smooth mouth coating luxurious experience, with a warming, comfortable hug, like wearing cozy fleece scarf hat and gloves on a cold day. Amazing. 

This is the first whiskey that I have PREFERRED with a splash of water. Others I've tried I have never enjoyed more than neat.  

&#x200B;","Good review! 
No one should begrudge your first take or how you felt after adding a splash of water. 

You might find as your journey continues and you drink more barrel proof and high proof buggers like this that you start to be able to pick out those same amazing flavors right off the fresh neck pour with no water.

But all the same I agree with pretty much everything you loved about it once you got it calibrated for your pallet. 

Fuck you could have ended it saying you added it to ginger ale and discovered your new favorite whiskey ever. As long as you enjoy it!
I agree with you on this. Completely different beast with some water.
So what you‚Äôre saying is I should definitely go snag the last Redbreast CS from the store downtown?
A123 and b523 are amazing I actually prefer the b523 a slightly just a little better finish..
I liked your thoughts on all this.

I keep my target spending at or below around $50 per bottle.  I find that if you have patience and are willing to take a risk on some that may end up duds, you can build a delicious collection at that price point.

I got a B522 as a gift last year, (I've got about half a bottle left) and I find water really makes that one much nicer as well.
I hate how hyped it is but its really lived up to it for me.  Its one of my favorite whiskeys I've ever tried.  Was incredibly rough on the first sip but once I got used to the bite I could explore its complexity.  That funky barrel note that coats your mouth and lingers on swallow just hits me in all the right spots.
I was most surprised with the added viscosity and mouthfeel with the water added.
As a fellow Redbreast 12CS fan I would say yes! RB12CS is to Irish what ECBP is to bourbon - a fantastic example at a reasonable price.
I definitely would!
Thanks!
I‚Äôve had one other ECBP, but I can‚Äôt remember if it was be B522 or C922.  I loved it, and don‚Äôt remember it feeling as hot as this one, but maybe my palate has changed since last year.  But I am loving the C923 now with a splash of water.
Also readily available, never have to worry about roided up prices."
Never seen so many combos deals to get an ECBP,,"The price is decent all things considered. The shitty part is their false claim of having an exclusive on ECBP C923, in order to sell you a bundle.
Maybe they mean ""elusive""
I did a combo at a small store recently $112 for the C923 and the Rye - receipt shows $73.99 + $37.99. I'm not complaining.
I hate how bundles are becoming the new thing to sell a bottle.
What, that's a fair deal. State minimum in my state is $75 for the ECBP, do the math
Not a bad bundle, but honestly in SoCal at least, there will be plenty of EC C923‚Äôs floating around that wont be behind a silly bundle. All the shipments are rolling in
That‚Äôs a fair pick imo. Given I can‚Äôt find C923 at all where I‚Äôm at, I‚Äôd pick that up in a heartbeat. Im calling a store every week in another state to check if they have been getting it because I know I have no chance at one here where I‚Äôm at.
Just went for it, don't really need the other 2 but they are decent bottles and I can find a use for them; HH7 will probably be a gift as I have one already, and all my other ryes are not really ones I'd want to freely make cocktails out of.
It is ""elusive"" for sure.  Just a mistake of the keyboard.

Anyhow, the package's price is reasonable.

EC Rye is $30, HH7-BiB for $40 and EC C923 for $80, a total of $150.
K&L barrel pick C923? /sarcasm
Haha I love how they're making fun of everybody with the name of this
Talked to one local store and said he had to buy 2 cases of EC small batch for every 1 bottle of ECBP. Crazy.
These bundles from KLW are all BS
C923 isn‚Äôt that hard to find‚Ä¶??
Shipping is probably $60.
Here's what's not cool about this bundle:

K&L is selling Elijah Craig Rye for $21. Heaven Hill BIB is findable for around $40 in So Cal

So then you're paying $150 minus $21 (EC Rye) minus $40 (HH BIB) = $89 for ECBP C923

FYI - A123 is on the site for $70

They are having trouble selling EC Rye and HH BIB which are both pretty undesirable bottles, so they're forcing you to take these bottles and pay an inflated price for ECBP.

It's unfortunate that K&L has moved this direction, but given how much whiskey they are discounting right now, it does seem the market is slowing a bit overall for the less super sought after bottles
Just went to a place recently and everything was bundled. Not only were they price gouging for the ‚Äúallocated‚Äù stuff but man the bottles they threw in were bottom of the barrel.I asked them why they did this. Said it was to prevent the same person from buying everything. If only they could think of another way to prevent the same person from buying more bottles‚Ä¶
It's ridiculous, but I'd rather be forced to buy more whiskey at an okay price than just straight up get gouged for what I want.
[deleted]
Typo has been fixed on their website. So unless elusive is also a shitty false claim everything is good.
I have yet to find it here in Kentucky
I‚Äôm fine with it. It makes it an option for people who actually want it to get it for MSRP, and it stops people from buying entire cases at a time.
I found 6 of them at a Total Wine in Redondo week and a half ago.
HH7 is $50 https://m.klwines.com/p/i?i=1452029, EC C923 is $70
That illegal for the distributor to do but also relatively common
This is very dependent on where you live. Im in AZ and unless you live next to a store that announces when they release it or camp out Total Wine every day, you won‚Äôt be getting it. Rumor has it Oregon is the same way as well.
A123 is ass though. Very ethanol forward and minimal front palate
they tend to do this on the first wave of releases then they'll have single bottles for purchase that might go very fast much faster than the bundles...it's not bad it allows people more opportunity to get the bottles if they're willing to deal with the bundle vs just having it sold out in 5mins and missing the drop. And stuff at KL literally sells out in 5-10 mins on the regular.
I don‚Äôt mind the bundle, I simply can‚Äôt stand when retailers/distributors/manufacturers straight up lie to move product. It‚Äôs a slimy move.
Funny how the mind works. I read it as elusive on their website. Probably just. An autocorrect mistake.
It was an honest mistake, I just have zero tolerance for deceptive marketing practices.

Personally I would buy this bundle if I needed the ECBP.
Same, ordered the rare tequila bundle to secure one. Figure if I find one locally in NKY it will be at least $100 anyway.
There are other ways to limit people from buying cases at a time. All else equal we as consumers should prefer to ability to buy bottles individually. Bundles vastly benefit sellers, not the consumer, unless there is a discount.
I saw them at TW as well last week, but I had to pick between MWND or ECBP C923, couldn‚Äôt get them both since they dropped the same day.
Most stores priced it at $49.99 ($50) but Binny's (IL) is selling it at $42 and some weekends they usually lower it to $39.

Well, it is still in the ballpark.  Cheers!
Yea lol. Tell that to those fool distributors.
If we are lucky. Been seeing the B batch marked up to 110 at many places. It‚Äôs like they are prepping us for the big hit.
Yep, a friend told me he saw a fb post a couple weeks ago about TPS putting some out for $75, but I never seem to have much luck at the big stores. Once it hits fb it‚Äôs generally too late anyway."
Review #15: Jack Daniel‚Äôs Singel Barrel Rye (featuring da Bottle Kill and Planet of Lana),"Hi there. I present thee another bottle. I‚Äôve posted about her before; this bottle was the first I ever bought. I went to the Jack Daniel‚Äôs Distillery when I was 21 and undertook their tour. My girlfriend and I tried out the higher end tour that showcased the JD SB, the SB rye, the no 27 gold, and the Sinatra select. I did NOT have Sinatra Select money (still don‚Äôt) but I did walk away with this. Way overpaid for it, it was like $38 for a 375ml; dumbass, naive me wasn‚Äôt making good business decisions at 21. This was also my personal favorite out of everything I tried at the time. Cheers to this bottle and cheers to JD for getting me into whiskey. I finished the entire thing before going on vacation. 

On a side note, I started and finished this little indie game called Planet of Lana on Games Pass yesterday. It‚Äôs beautiful. The art style is incredible, the atmosphere creates an almost child-like wonder, and the sound design plus soundtrack is top notch. I do think the puzzles are a little bit too easy, and I did have a bit of an audio glitch during one of the encounters with a monster. But, overall, it‚Äôs a great little adventure. 8/10 for me. If you like Inside and Limbo and like vibrant art styles, this is a good game for you. I needed something to help get the disappointment I had with Starfield out. Anyways, back to the rye!

This is on JD‚Äôs website since copy and paste might be the magnum opus of mankind: ‚ÄúThis historic creation marries the smoothness of Jack Daniel‚Äôs with a unique 70% rye grain bill. Complex flavors of ripe fruit mingle with light toasted oak notes to create a taste rich with spice and a pleasant lingering finish. This is a big, bold rye that does not overpower.‚Äù At the time of the original creation of this bottle, it was the first new mashbill they had put out since 1866. That‚Äôs a long fucking time. Speaking of which, I‚Äôve probably dragged this on for long enough. I let this rest for 15 minutes before delving in. 

Distillery: Jack Daniel‚Äôs Distillery 

Classification: Rye

Type & Region: Rye, Tennessee, USA

Alcohol: 47% (94 proof)

Composition: 70% Rye, 18% Corn, 12% Malted Barley

Aged: NAS

Cask type: new, charred American oak 

Barrel: Rick no. R-1, Barrel no 19-08217, bottling date 11/19/2019. 

Nose: classic JD banana scent. This one is more of a banana cream pie. Spearmint, caramel, vanilla, some milder rye spice. Butterscotch, cherry, oakiness, and cinnamon strudel. After tasting maple syrup and wintergreen mint is present. Swirling is where you get the mint. 

Taste: first taste is caramel, rye, cinnamon, banana nut bread, and clove. Banana runts, tons of banana in this. More than I get in other JD offerings. Black pepper, brown sugar, and spearmint further in. Chewing unlocks more allspice, black pepper, and oak. Finish is peanut butter and vanilla with cherry, rye spice, and slight to moderate tannic oakiness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and it‚Äôs smooth all the way. 

I like this bottle a lot. I got ripped off at the distillery for this, sure. Am I annoyed still? Eh. Kinda funny looking back at it. Does this bottle do pretty well at its actual price point? I think so. I don‚Äôt know how popular of an opinion this is, but I believe this bottle fares just as well as the SB bourbon does. They‚Äôre also fairly similar, but this one has a bit more rye spice and some mint to it. I‚Äôll get another one here at some point, maybe a store pick. 

Score: 86. A very good pour, will definitely grab another when it‚Äôs empty.

Grading Scale:  (courtesy of u/Letter10 thanks again)  
96-100: Outstanding pour, will buy another bottle asap. Perfect    
90-95: Damn good pour, I'm smitten    
85-89: A very good Pour, will definitely grab another when its empty    
80-84: Pretty solid pour, everyday drinker depending on value    
75-79: Eh, still drinkable but not in any hurry to get another    
70-74: Share it with friends who pretend to like whiskey    
65-69: Not worth the money in my opinion    
64 and below: probably not going to finish this stuff","Have you been able to compare with a barrel proof?
Not yet but I think that‚Äôll be my next stop in the JD train."
Tried Makers Mark Cellar Aged last night at a restaurant. Quick thoughts‚Ä¶,"Like many of us, I‚Äôve been on the hunt for MMCA at any sort of reasonable price to no avail. But last night I was able to try a pour at dinner. This will not be a full review, but just my thoughts after a 1oz test drive. 

Context. I had some of my 21 WLW the night before, so fairly close proximity to compare. 

My takeaway:

Makers Mark Cellar Aged is definitely a very special whiskey experience. Probably the closest thing to a WLW experience I‚Äôve had outside WLW itself. In very basic terms‚Ä¶ If my 21 WLW is a 10/10 experience, I‚Äôd say this MMCA is a solid 9/10. 

What the MMCA lacks noticeably compared to WLWs and Pappy 15s I‚Äôve had is the vivid pungent aroma that the drams from Buffalo Trace seem to have perfected. MMCA is actually quite soft on the nose‚Ä¶ in a blind you probly wouldn‚Äôt peg it as anything even remotely special by the aroma. 

But then you take a sip and the MMCA bursts onto your whole palate with a symphony of well-aged wheater flavors‚Ä¶ caramel, vanilla, cherries, rich oak, etc. The intensity on the palate and the amazing long finish definitely will hold its own in a direct fight with WLW‚Ä¶ not sure who‚Äôd actually win without trying it for myself, but I can tell you it would be a solid competition. 

After tasting MMCA I‚Äôd definitely say the amount I‚Äôm willing to consider paying for a bottle went up. I‚Äôm still not gonna just go pay secondary, but put one in front of me for 299 and it‚Äôd be real tough to walk away üòÇ","Good review.  I appreciate the thorough write up and I like your mindset as far as how you taste the whiskey.  That makes me very interested to try this as well!
Awesome you got to try it! I‚Äôm still waiting for my chance. What was the damage for a pour? $40?
That‚Äôs the great thing about bourbon, everyone has different tastes. I actually thought MMCA was very underwhelming, and not worth the MSRP let alone secondary. Luckily I got a sample of it before I opened my bottle and was able to trade it off for some bottles I know I like.
I was lucky enough to get a taste of this. Probably top five I‚Äôve ever tasted. Super long finish with almost an effervescent feel on my tongue. Great flavor and I‚Äôm not usually a MM fan anymore.
I was lucky enough to score a bottle it‚Äôs outstanding
I hate that im not up to speed with all the abbreviations this sub loves to use, but good for you OP! I have been looking for this bottle but didn't think to see if any local restaurants have it to taste!
I just found one in NYC this past weekend......on the shelf of a random store for $170. Couldn't believe it. So they are out there in the wild!

Have not opened it yet, but based on these comments anticipation is high!
What is secondary on this?
I've only read a couple reviews on this and they were middling. I think the key issue was that whisky doesn't age (much? At all?) Below a certain temperature. This was aged below that temp. Because of that, it lacks character that it may have otherwise had were it aged ""properly."" (Notice the quote marks. I use the term loosely. Creativity is a thing). It's good to read a dissenting opinion. Hopefully I can find a bottle or pour at a reasonable price.
Have you had a Weller Full Proof (Store Pick)? If so, how would you compare it to this?
Definitely worth it at any price you feel you can swing.
$25/oz. Not even bad haha
Yea I had heard others say the same and I had actually cooled off on trying to find one. But after trying it I don‚Äôt totally agree with that take.
Same. This is next level for Makers.
I did have to ask for it specifically. It was not on the bar haha
Wow! Great score!
400ish. I hear some may be moving a little less even.
The rate of oak extraction slows down, but the rate of oxidation stays the same. The idea was to prevent any back of palate bitterness/tannin perception, while developing brighter fruit notes, delicate spice, creamy texture, longer finish.

The raspberry notes are quite lovely, but I‚Äôm a sucker for that.
Yea I had heard those reviews too. For me, in the glass it drinks quite special, not like much else I‚Äôve had other than WLW, really.
I have. This definitely has more age and refinement on the palate than WFP. 

I find WFPs actually drink a bit hot.
I definitely prefer the WFP to this. To each their own, but MMCA is a far cry from being anywhere close to a WLW. I traded mine away for 2 staggs
shit at that price i would have had a few
Interesting! The ones around me will put it out for the most part. There's one spot where the good stuff only comes out when a certain manager is on - to ensure it gets sold correctly.
You're right. I definitely misspoke, didn't remember fully, what I read. 

I think I'd like it too. I've really enjoy the sweeter/brighter bourbons I've consumed.
On your raspberry notes.  Do you have a a rec that would provide that?
I've not had wlw, but I've had other highly sought after whiskies. The one time I saw it, I ordered a pour and they came back and said they were out.
Interesting. I've only had a WFP (non store pick) which I thought was really good, but not worth the crazy hype.

I lucked out on a WFP Store Pick recently and am hoping that's a step up from the standard WFP.
I was driving, unfortunately üòÇ
You should check out this [podcast](https://thebourbonlife.libsyn.com/website/season-4-episode-40-blake-layfield-beth-buckner-makers-mark) with Beth Buckner, Senior Manager of Innovation & Blending, the person who blended it.

Sounds good, I will. Appreciate the recommendation."
I normally buy to drink but I think this one might just be my first shelf queen.,"Had a buddy travel this weekend to Indiana and knew that these were only available on shelves in Iowa/Indiana. Missed out on all the online drops (also it was $20 more online before tax & shipping).

Not much in the ways of online reviews or consumer based info available. It's only 2 year old corn juice and low-mid proof. Rather than open it and potentially be disappointed I think this one will be my first ""collection"" bottle/shelf queen. Not because I'd ever expect it to be a collector's item but because I think it's a neat display bottle to have.

Anyone have any personal tasting info or know anything other than what's available with a quick Google search?",You can still keep the bottle and drink it too.
Yellowstone 119 Proof Single Barrel - OHLQ Exclusive Review,"Hello all! This is my first proper full review, so it may not be as in-depth as others. But I'll do my best!

This was a fascinating one for me. I don't think of Yellowstone as a high-proof distiller. I've only had one bottle from them before, a Yellowstone Single Malt 108 that I picked up on a whim for no particular reason. I'll say I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was, though as I've stated in a previous post here, I'm not really sure why. It's complex enough to provide a well rounded experience, but also simple enough not to demand your attention to enjoy. It's a good, high quality sipper that doesn't overshadow anything else, and that's okay for me!

Since I enjoyed the 108, I know I had to give this a try when I saw it pop up on the OHLQ website for $65. 

This particular Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey barrel pick from OHLQ was barreled from Cask No. 10563 on 9/4/2018. Now on to the review.

I tasted mine neat after 15 minutes rest:

Color: This bourbon is a very rich, dark brown with a healthy touch of redness, resulting in a lovely rich mahogany color. Surprisingly dark for a 5 year bottle.

Nose: Angel food cake, oak, brown sugar, vanilla extract, with a hint of dark cherries or cherry wine at the end.

Palate: Opens mostly with heat and dark fruit. Quickly settles into charred oak and molasses. Somewhat sweet, rather viscous, and coats the mouth well.

Finish: Very long finish on this one, nearing 20 to 30 seconds depending on whether or not you ""chew"". Starts on toffee, slowly transitioning into a pleasant toasted oak. The entire finish is, I think, best described as tasting how woodchips in a smoker smell.

Overall: 85/100

Very pleased with this bottle. I'd buy another in a heartbeat. The only indication of this bourbons youth is the heat going in- but despite that, it's very smooth going down and lingers quite a while, encouraging you to enjoy the experience before taking another sip. It's pleasantly sweet and shockingly oak-forward for it's young age. The only whiskey I've had with a similar sweetness and oak-forwardness is Woodford Reserve Double Oaked, which is saying something. WRDO was my favorite bottle, but this may have it beat. It's a more dynamic experience with a little more complexity than the Woodford brings to the table, with the mouthfeel and sticking power courtesy of a much higher proof. 

While this is a barrel pick OHLQ exclusive, if you're running through the state for whatever ungodly reason, or you're insane enough to live here like me-pop open the OHLQ website and find yourself a bottle. It's more than worth it, even at $65.","When I go to their website, my screen goes blank. It just doesn‚Äôt work. They‚Äôve always been incompetent tho, so no surprise. As for the bottle, this stuff really reminded me of Jim Beam to the point I‚Äôd use it as my warmup for Bakers or Bookers.
Glad you enjoyed the 119 so much! I snagged a 115 OHLQ as well, and it is right there with yours. I enjoyed it and felt it was playing ball with some other 110+ proof big guys. Nice find!"
Fresh Crack for Tonight,"Been pumped to get my hands on this one. First sitting with it tonight. First impression - it‚Äôs amazingly complex. I‚Äôm going to have to try it more to parse out more. First tasting: sweet on the front end with vanilla, marshmallow, and caramel turning to a long finish of spice, pepper, and oak. Those are just the flavors I could get. My wife (whose pallet is better) also picked up some fruity notes - cherry on the front and blueberry on the finish. This one‚Äôs a winner, though. Amazing.","Is it worth picking up? My local has a few.
Your local likely doesn‚Äôt have this particular bottle. I could be wrong but I highly doubt it. 

I was lucky enough to get one through u/t8ke barrel program since I hesitated in pulling the trigger directly from barrels website which sold out very quickly. 

This bottle could only be acquired through a few sources. 

‚ÄúUsually when Barrell makes something, they make plenty to go around. For instance, my bottle of Barrell Batch 035 Bourbon reads #19,154. It‚Äôs sent all over the country, to bars and restaurants and distributors and there is plenty to go around. 

For this release, due to the age of the components, they only produced 500 cases. A case in the liquor business is 6 bottles. That is 3000 bottles, total. For the entire country. If you break it down, that‚Äôs 60 bottles for each state. It will be very limited compared to just about every other whiskey blend they have ever made. Hell, they make more Gold than this. That Maker‚Äôs Mark Cellar Aged everyone is freaking out about? That‚Äôs 30,000 bottles for the country. ‚Äú - u/t8ke
Absolutely! Msrp is around $85 - in my opinion this is one of the best Barrell batches you can find. I‚Äôd be surprised if you could find it on a shelf though. The 10 Year was made as a micro batch specifically for their 10 Year celebration party.
No, obviously, not those particular bottles but a few in the range. Never had any have always passed them up. Obviously, they wouldn't have loads of these.
I got mine through u/t8ke too!
yeah that guy is mistaking this for something else
Few barrell releases I‚Äôve tried have been over priced sourced blends‚Ä¶ they are good, but there are better. It‚Äôs a ‚Äústumble across‚Äù for me but, meh more excited about bookers releases. Fun to see someone make Dickel decent, but eh I can leave it.
No, they're these. Not this bottle, exactly, but it has a few of these. Never had any.
barrell has a lot of really cool bottlings. I‚Äôd recommend Batch 35, vantage and dovetail particularly for your firsts!
Thanks."
Sagamore 8yr Rye Batch 2a Review,"New to posting reviews here but I really love this Rye. Been getting into the ryes a little more lately and this one is up there with my favorites so far.

Nose : Spicy with a touch of wintergreen mint, followed by a little floral note and a hit of vanilla.

Palate : Like the nose suggested there is a good amount of wintergreen mint in here, and the spice was a little less than it lead me to believe but is definitely present. Also has that touch of vanilla and a slight hint of apricot.

Finish : This goes on and on and does not disappoint with its long lasting feel. Very slightly oily, but full bodied.","is it still MGP?
Yep, back of the bottle still says Distilled in Indiana. I understand some of the newer stuff is their product
Contract distilled by MGP but it‚Äôs Sagamores own mash bill.
yes that is how MGP works
You‚Äôre incorrect. You‚Äôre thinking they buy MGP juice but they don‚Äôt.
huh that's so weird I really thought they did. Actually let me check my two bottles of Sagamore I have on hand.

Well geez, my Sagamore Double Oak says distilled in Indiana but bottled in Maryland. Usually that means MGP but hey I could be wrong.

https://imgur.com/a/pfUCXiw

let me check my other bottle.

we'll golly, my rum cask finish says distilled in Indiana too! what do you think of this???

https://imgur.com/a/u9biOpu

do me a favor and check your bottles of Sagamore and post em here, yk, just for fun. I'll wait
You‚Äôre very intelligent and clearly understand the difference between contract and sourcing
When did I use any of that verbage? MGP distills the grain spirit and sends the spirit to Sagamore who ages it and bottles it. What are you on about? Why did you reply to my comment? what do you think I don't understand?"
Never had whisky before - tried 7 whiskies neat,"I thought it would be fun to have some whisky to relax with on evenings off. I‚Äôve only had whisky neat twice before (Chivas regal 18yo (which was okay) and a random bottle a friend let me try which tasted wonderful - I should ask him what it was), so I bought the miniatures available at my local store to try several varieties to see what was good. 

Here‚Äôs my ranking of the 7 whiskies. I chose the order randomly when drinking. I‚Äôm not a connoisseur (yet) and can‚Äôt write about things like tasting notes or anything this is just some impressions for your entertainment. 

1. Jim Beam Original - I didn‚Äôt enjoy it. It just tasted like spicy alcohol.

2. Johnnie Walker Gold - I enjoyed it. The alcohol taste blended well into the overall flavour and it was nice and sweet.

3. Jack Daniels - I didn‚Äôt enjoy it. The internet led me to believe that the American ones would be the easiest for new drinkers to enjoy, but that was not my experience. Both relegated to cocktails only.

4. Glenlivet 12yo - It was actually great. I thought it was like the JW Gold but more refined and subtler. Made me feel like I was in a beautiful sunny glade.

5. Johnnie Walker Red - It was okay. It had the unpleasant alcohol taste that the JB and JD had, but the other flavours were quite enjoyable.

6. Glenfiddich 12yo - It was actually great. The flavour was not as strong as the other whiskies, but everything blended together really deliciously and made me feel like I was in a cozy wood cabin in the woods with a warm fire burning.

7. Johnnie Walker Black Label - I enjoyed it. I‚Äôd rank it the same as JW Gold, but in a different way - it‚Äôs darker and more spicy.","Don‚Äôt give up on American whiskies just because beam and jd suck. Go grab a bottle of knob creek, buffalo trace, wild turkey 101, or old grand dad bonded/114.
One of us, one of us‚Ä¶
Sounds like you had fun and found some things that you liked! Of note for the American Whiskey: Jim Beam and Jack Daniel‚Äôs are bottom shelf mixers (at least the standard products are - Jack Daniel‚Äôs Single Barrels are great). There are many things that are much better than those. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs available to you where you live, but I wouldn‚Äôt judge the category as a whole based on those two.
I‚Äôll say this about bourbon vs scotch: bourbon has a more narrow flavor profile. Caramel, vanilla, and oak dominate. You might get some banana, cherry, toffee, cinnamon, or even birthday cake notes but the range has nothing on the whole of Scottish whiskies. That said, Jim Beam and Jack Daniel‚Äôs have a huge gap in what they *can* do versus the mainstays. 

I like that you‚Äôre doing this with an open mind and only going for miniature bottles. This is fun to figure out on your own.
Neat.
I would suggest that you look for whiskey tastings. They could be at a liquor store, bar/restaurant or even a charity event. These tastings usually feature a distillery or a group that owns several distilleries has to offer. The Glenlivet's brand ambassadors will do a good one- they'll have stuff there for you to smell or would break down the tasting notes sp you learn. 
 You already did the other thing I recommend, mini bottles. Also, some big distilleries will have a whole set with some of their basic expressions to try. Christmas will.also bring these tasters out.
 Finally I have some buddies with a podcast- the Whiskey Tangent. They have an entertaining show and can be useful in deciding what to get. If you start at the beginning, you'll see their growth as they learn how to taste properly. They b also give solid advice on whiskey to try.
 Most of all, have fun!
For years I only drank Scotch and did not like bourbons, because they were too sweet. Now a days I like them equally for the most part, but Lagavulin is my #1 fav which there's no equal in bourbon.
Congrats on starting your journey!   Discover what you like and don‚Äôt, and pursue more of the flavor profiles you enjoy.  Have a great time and just keep trying!   The really expensive stuff is good, but you can find great flavors for very reasonable prices ‚Äî everyone has a different palette.  Have fun and enjoy your journey!
This is pretty close to what Id think. Try the 15 yrs of glenlivet/fiddich. They are both some of my favorites especially for the price.
Hibiki Japanese harmony is very good. Pretty much anything from Suntory is is great. Be careful of fake Japanese whisky. But things are getting better with companies that have come together and created the JSLM. I recommend checking that out before you purchase anything else that calls it self Japanese whisky. Suntory is apart of the JSLM. Enjoy your journey!
If you liked Johnny Walker Gold try Glenmorangie 10 year or Nectar D‚ÄôOr. the 10 year is a decent price and has that sweet honey flavor and I‚Äôve heard the Nectar D‚ÄôOr is even better but haven‚Äôt tried it yet. Both cost less too.
I thought the Jim Beam white was bland but the black is supposed to be better.  I do recommend the Jim Beam rye whiskey.  I think you'll like the JW 18 and Green.  I actually enjoyed JW Red even though I had avoided it due to many negative  reviews.  I love Glenlivet 12 and I found Glenfiddich 12 to be bland.    I also recommend Glenmorangie 10 and Evan Williams.
I would highly recommend Woodford Reserve Double Oaked it‚Äôs excellent and runs around $55. There‚Äôs so many to list but this is one of my favorites for that price point.
JD sucks. Please don't let your American whiskey tasting journey end there. I also think Jim Beam is bad and tastes like cheap liquor.

Try Old Forester instead before you write off American whiskey altogether. And you like scotch, so definitely try some Japanese whiskeys too.
Experiment with different mashbills to see what flavors are your preference. You might like wheaters( Makers Mark, Larceny BP, or Wellers) or high ryes ( 4 Roses, Bulleit, ) . Start with lower proof and work your way up. By the way, comparing JD7 with JW Blue is not playing fair. You should compare JD 12 year to JW Blue, similar price points.
Then you'd enjoy Walker Green label.

Stop buying the cheaper ones and save up to buy something like Glenlivet 18.  Now we are talking about very nice stuff..
Alright I‚Äôll try some more sometime. I just took one of each mini bottle at the store :)
I had a bad experience with wild turkey 101 when I was 21 and hadnt tried it since until this past summer. I was actually surprised it was pretty good. I'm 35 now
I‚Äôll try some more American whiskies sometime in that case. Those were the only two the store had in miniature bottles
Thanks, that‚Äôs the plan. Originally I just wanted to buy one good bottle to enjoy, but when I googled ‚Äúwhat is a good whisky‚Äù the answers were all wildly different.
I really wanted to get some Japanese whisky, they caught my eye because the bottle designs look so good. But they‚Äôre too expensive for now.
Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll try some more American whiskies. I‚Äôll use the comments I‚Äôve got on this post as recommendations
Total wine has a pretty solid mini selection as well as a section of 375ml if you're just wanting to try as much variations as possible.
When I was first getting into whiskey, I actually started by building a full lineup (over a few months) of the Johnnie Walker library, from Red to Blue.  Learning from their structured 'tier' system that's easy to understand really helped me learn to figure out what flavors I like and serve as the foundation I used to explore other Scotch and then eventually Bourbon.

Don't write off American whiskey completely just yet, but definitely explore deeper into the brands that you did like so far.
Look for a mini of Lazy River if you have a total wine around. Very good beginner bourbon
Yeah I imagine options are limited for mini bottles. Is there a good bar near you where you can try different things? That‚Äôs another option without investing a ton of money into different bottles.
Yeah, there‚Äôs a lot out there.  And a lot of supply/demand and secondary pricing that makes it tough.   As a bourbon guy, I‚Äôd suggest trying Larceny, 1792, and Basil Hayden to start.  Wheated, easier to digest. Less harsh. Of those three, if you can find and want to spend more:  Larceny Barrel Proof, 1792 full proof, and Basil Hayden 10.   But remember, Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day!
Suntory toki is 33 usd at total wine. It‚Äôs the affordable. Nikka coffee grain is around 61 at the same place
Unfortunately there are no Total wines in my country, but now I know where to go if I visit USA
Is Suntory toki ‚Äúgood‚Äù? That seems like an enticing price"
Redbreast 27 Batch 4 - thoughts?,"I‚Äôm able to get my hands on some batch 4, but I haven‚Äôt seen many reviews or comparisons. I‚Äôve personally tried (and finished) a batch 2 and though it took a while to grow on me, I started loving the blood orange and tropical fruit notes. Is batch 4 similar?","Have only tried 3. Came hear to say I didn‚Äôt even realize the bottle was red until I opened it and poured some out.
More dried fruit than tropical fruit per a Whiskybase review.

[https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/226239/redbreast-27-year-old](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/226239/redbreast-27-year-old)

Personally, I've only ever had batch 2.  And while I realize that based on the age of the whiskey it can be very hard to keep the batches consistent, I can't imagine any batch being less than glorious.
I have both batch 1 and 2.  Both are amazing and an experience like ive yet to have again.    Cant imagine batch 4 is somehow worse.
Yeah that‚Äôs the only batch 4 review comparison I could find. I also saw someone on Reddit say batches 1, 2 and 4 are good while avoid 3 (or something similar).  

I‚Äôm primarily attracted to the tropical fruit so that worries me a bit.
I saw that same thing and it steered me away from grabbing B4 at Costco when they had it.
Have batch 3 and gotta say that while orange is the big note, there is noticeable tropical fruit as well. All redbreast will be great regardless of age lol. 

If you primarily just want tropical fruit, and don‚Äôt want to take the chance, I‚Äôd suggest just getting the 21. You‚Äôll save some money as well
I have every batch and would not tell you to avoid any of them. They are all spectacular. This is the first I‚Äôve ever heard someone say avoid any batch.
Ah I need to find a dram of the 21 to compare then.  I heard the 21 had less of the tropics due to the different oak treatment.
I just ordered 3 bottles after reading your message.  Thanks for making up my mind (and lightening my wallet in the process)!
Really? For me the 21 is nothing but tropical fruits"
All out of bourbon - Which one should I go get?,,"if price isn't an issue, Booker's every time.
Bookers is the best out of the three for the prices.
Sipping on the old ezra 7 tonight. I have the rye as well. My favorite 75 dollar bottle. If you havent had it yet, go for it
Bookers
Anyone saying a barrel strength, barrel pick Yellow Stone is not worth $65 doesn‚Äôt know their ass from a glencairn. All of the Yellow Stone barrel picks I have had were great. Booker‚Äôs was and has always been a $70 gimmick bourbon at best.
Bookers, easily, but the others aren't bad options!
Bookers
Bookers but which batch ??
Don't sleep on the Yellowstone.
The old Ezra is best of the three but not for $80.
I would do the Bookers. I haven't had Yellowstone and the Ezra 7 isn't bad, but I needed to let mine sit for a few days after drinking the neck pour.  It was very hot at first, but then the molasses brown sugar and spice notes came through later. It is good though. I guess it depends what you want to spend
Bookers
Isn‚Äôt Yellowstone MGP( not a bad thing at all though)?
Yellowstone without a doubt! Their picks are to die for imo. Definitely way more interesting and fairly priced than Bookers
Bookers. The other two aren‚Äôt great for the price
I‚Äôve heard good things about ezra brooks. Haven‚Äôt had it myself. Maybe get a single barrel of that barrel strength for 80 tho its like 70-60 around me unless its a SB
I really like my old Ezra, but I don‚Äôt think it cost me $80. Every time I see Bookers it‚Äôs over $100 by at least a little so that would be my suggestion.
Agreed. I was also going to say I‚Äôm only familiar with Booker‚Äôs so that‚Äôs my default answer lol
The pick I have tastes like the leftover water in a bag of boiled peanuts you get on the side of the road. It ain't bad, very mood dependent, but to say anyone being critical of it ""doesn't know their ass from a glencairn"" is needlessly aggressive, lol
Interesting. I've heard the Yellowstone picks weren't that great, but have never tried them. I have a store by me right now with a store pick. I may have to give it a shot
2023-03 in Ohio right now
Most Yellowstone is distilled in house these days. I don‚Äôt recall which.
I‚Äôve heard many talking about how good they are, and they probably are, but given variations in single barrels the two I‚Äôve tried were mediocre at best. Had one pour from my bottle and that‚Äôs probably the last I‚Äôll touch it. To each their own but I‚Äôll never buy another again
Thanks for the correction on that"
DEAD MAN REVIEW #38 ‚Äì The Deacon Scotch Whisky,,"$35 bottle, $5 scotch.

That‚Äôs why I never buy bottles dressed up like this. Good whiskey does not need these kinds of bottles. It‚Äôs almost always crap inside
I am keeping myself personally responsible for upholding my vow to review all new whisk(e)y upon bottle kill. I will be upfront: this one really doesn‚Äôt deserve it, so I‚Äôm not putting a whole lot of effort into this, but I intend to offer a whole lot of honesty‚Ä¶  
This one caught my eye one sunny morning by the bottle draw alone. I saw that glimmering copper bastard, the elegantly detailed stopper (molded plastic and synthetic cork), the quirky ‚Äúspy-vs-spy-esque‚Äù mascot, and of course the price tag, and was instantaneously sold. Did I stop and think to myself ‚ÄúI wonder if the fancy bottle is a marketing ploy to get you to purchase the shitty whisky inside?‚Äù Yes, I had that fleeting concern for the briefest of moments, then sunlight caught it just right again and the bottle winked at me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never do that to you‚Äù it said coyly‚Ä¶  
**Bottle**: The Deacon (blended Scotch whisky)  
**Proof**: 80  
**Paid**: $39.99 (and I regret every dollar of it)  
**Glass**: Glencairn (to be very clear, the only time this whisky hit a glen was on the neck pour, and then after realizing what I was dealing with, on this final tasting‚Ä¶ during all other drinking opportunities this scotch was put on many, many rocks and ‚Äúenjoyed‚Äù out of a low ball)  
**Ambience**: The only way I could increase my desire to perform this review was to find a suitable audio track to cheer me on‚Ä¶ For this important task, I called upon none other than Steely Dan to help me through this hard time. Threw on *Aja* Side A, specifically queued up ‚ÄúDeacon Blues,‚Äù and let the troubles wash away‚Ä¶ FUN TRIVIA ‚Äì Until I pulled out the lyrics sleeve for the photo-op, I had always assumed the pertinent lyrics were: ‚ÄúDrink Scotch whisky all night long, And DINE behind the wheel.‚Äù Turns out I have been singing it wrong for decades, the line is ‚Äú‚Ä¶die behind the wheel.‚Äù Go figure. Gotta be honest, made more sense to me with ‚Äúdine,‚Äù I just assumed it meant ‚Äúdining on the road‚Äù while traveling town to town playing gigs. Guess I need to pour some (better) Scotch and marinate on what the REAL lyrics might mean‚Ä¶  
**Summary**: See Pic #2 for detailed tasting notes‚Ä¶ The nose is not offensive at all. Smooth peat smoke, orchard fruit, and some floral notes. But then I take a sip and it‚Äôs thin, immediately smokey, but absolutely drowning in a sweetness that conflicts with the peat/wood/spice. It‚Äôs almost like someone took kid‚Äôs white grape juice and blended it with low-proof distillate right off the tap. Though I don‚Äôt prefer peat-monsters, any enjoyment of the smoke is derailed by the unfriendly tart and fruit notes. And unlike the promise on the bottle, the finish is anything but ‚Äúlong and strong.‚Äù  
**t8ke scale** = 2 = This is $40 Scotch that drinks like a $20 bottom-shelfer. I would prefer cheaper alternatives like John Barr, Dewar‚Äôs, and Johnny Walker Red over this any day‚Ä¶ and that isn‚Äôt saying much at all.
At least you have the best pressing of this album. The AB is special
[deleted]
At least the album is a 9.5.
Try it playing some John Deacon? It could be ‚ÄòAnother One Bites the Dust‚Äô or it could be ‚ÄòYour My Best Friend‚Äô.
My wife bought this bottle for our christmas dinner. I can't believe a whiskey can taste so watered down, and yet so smoky at the same time. That's basically the flavour of this whiskey: water and smoke.
[deleted]
I  made the mistake of blind purchasing this bottle only upside is it can be used to add a less offensive smoke flavor to some cooking gonna experiment don't have alot of hope though
My husband and thought it tasted vaguely of how new rubber smells. We also got suckered by the pretty bottle.
Yes, undeniable truth that i helped prove for the greater glory of whiskeydom. The sad thing is I assure you this won‚Äôt be the last stupid purchase I make based solely on the bottle (I‚Äôm a fucking sucker for samurai‚Ä¶).
Quite literally UNDRINKABLE. I even tried blending it off with an inexpensive blended scotch that I DON'T hate (however few and far between)... is it me or does it taste like formaldehyde smells? üòÖ
If you don‚Äôt mind me asking (I‚Äôm not enough of an audiophile to know), what‚Äôs so special about this particular pressing?
ü§£ no bullshit, I switched to Glenfiddich 14. Great minds ü•É
Shit yeah, made time for the whole LP.
Damn, I didn‚Äôt think about that‚Ä¶ deep cut. 

‚Ä¶ would have been another one bites the dust for sure. ü•É
Yup, nailed it.
Thank you, I appreciate the kind words!
Set the bar of expectation real low. But trooper for not just pouring it‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs how you know you really whiskey. ü•É
Yup and yep‚Ä¶ü•É
Took one for the team.
That being said...  & as previously stated... Kudos to the marketing team. üëè You sold a shit popsicle to a woman in white gloves.
ü§£well said. Tbh it‚Äôs so fucking bad I wouldn‚Äôt even consider combine/mix/blend with anything but ice/water as I would hate to loose my desire for the mixer‚Ä¶ thanks for confirming I‚Äôm not batshit. ü•É
The AB 1006 (not AA even tho similar vintage) is the first cut of this album and is often regarded as sounding closest to the master
What‚Äôs next Royal Scam and Crown Royal?  High West Campfire (or Cuervo Gold) and Gaucho? Jack of Speed and Jack Daniels Single Barrel?J/k but sounds like the start of a good night.  

IMO Royal Scam is peak Dan (Katie Lied a close second).  That being said I love them all especially the newer live album compilation.
My son best described the taste. He said it tastes like a house fire smells. I thought that was spot on.
Coolest fucking $40 cork I have bruh!
I admit I‚Äôm old but not quite old enough to have bought it first hand. But I am OCD buying second hand‚Ä¶ I took advantage buying a lot of my vinyl collection back in the very early 2000s just about when vinyl was nearly dead. Pretty sure I would have snagged this Dan album for about $10 (I was cheap and not spending more than $5-15 an LP back then searching through shelf after shelf). Fortunately it plays beautifully. Love knowing I get to enjoy something that has some value, makes it that much more valuable to me. ü•É
Royal Scam for sure. Aja has a place in my heart for sentimental reasons. But Gaucho never really hit home with me; accidentally left that particular LP in an awkward unsupported lean for 6months and it‚Äôs no longer playable, and I honestly don‚Äôt mind all that much.
Yeah that‚Äôs a pretty damn accurate take.
Fortunately they did produce a good number of these so they‚Äôre not unobtanium even with the renewed interest in vinyl. Plus the more recent remastered versions of this are also really good. I picked up one for general playing so I can preserve my AB for special occasions
Truly appreciate the insight!"
Are aroma kits a gimmick?,Do they really help u identify aromas or even tasting notes? Which one do u recommend? Or can I just use raw food and spice to build my own to save money?,"I think they definitely help. My wife bought me one for Christmas, and I enjoy trying to pick out some of the aromas in pours by going back and forth between the whiskey and the kit. 

I feel like it‚Äôs best to start with a pour that you have tasting/nosing notes (either from the distillery or reviews) where you can really search for those notes that are likely to be in there. Then you can branch out to other notes or new pours. 

You could certainly make your own cheaper. That was certainly my plan, but I put it off long enough that my wife beat me to the punch, and I doubt I would have been motivated enough yet to do it, so it‚Äôs probably best that I have a pre-made kit.
I‚Äôve wondered this too. I want to be able to advance my nose, but I don‚Äôt wanna throw money away
If only they didn't cost as much as a new cabinet or a couple high end bottles
You could go smell everything at the grocery store if you wanted. And open up your spice cabinet
Make your own. There are sites with lists of scents to put in a kit. https://kybourbon.com/?s=Nosing+kit"
Obtainium 27 year old Canadian whiskey 160 proof,"I went to the liquor store today for some whiskey but came home with a bottle of jet fuel instead

Obtainium 27 year old Canadian whiskey. Coming in at a humble 160 proof from cat's eye distillery in Iowa. I'm pretty sure this is 100% corn. It's sourced from Palliser distillery (black velvet) basically a light whiskey they'd use to blend with rye for black velvet but instead of blending this just sat in used rye barrels for 27 years rather than finding it's way into a plastic jug back in the 90's.

My palate isn't refined enough to give a proper review but I have to share my thoughts because I haven't seen nearly enough reviews for this nuclear hooch.

I took a neck sip and quickly decided this needed to rest for a few minutes. But this stuff is so powerful I don't think it rested at all, it was just just biding it's time trapped in a glass.

The nose definitely has some ethanol. But also strong sweet notes of brown sugar, maple syrup, and a hint of raspberry or cranberry... something red

The first sip brings a huge amount of brown sugar. A little rye spice mid palate and what seems like a butterscotch infused cinnamon toast crunch in the back of the mouth. It's pretty oily and nowhere near as hot as you'd think with 160 proof.

The finish gives heat deep in your chest. It allows you to pin point the exact path of your esophagus all the way to your stomach. Not uncomfortable but it's emphatic. There's some oak and drying tannins but it's not off-putting at all. 

Putting it on ice really makes it shine. I'm sure it watered down to an emasculated 140 proof or so. But now the heat is almost gone (neat it drank like 130 proof, on ice it's more like 105) and it tastes like a hickory glaze you'd put on salmon. Extremely well balanced oak and caramel finish.

One of the best and most unique bottles I've tried. A dog with a note in his mouth should be able to sell this stuff! I highly recommend giving it a try.","This sounds amazing
Picked up the same batch, bottle 149. Can‚Äôt wait to try it after reading your review!
Love to see someone drinking one of these!
After having it for a night I can now report back that it definitely works lol. And 3-4 glasses on an empty stomach might be a little too much no matter how good it tastes.
Right on. Let us know what you think!"
Finally got one,"I‚Äôve always been a huge fan of EC. I‚Äôve enjoyed every BP or SB I‚Äôve had thus far and was very interested in how the 18 yr stacked up. I‚Äôve seen it in the wild a few times for well above msrp but never purchased. Finally found one today at $150 and pulled the trigger. I had some reservations as I‚Äôve seen some negative reviews and thought can it really be that much better than the BP to justify twice the price. 

Overall I think it does justify the price. It‚Äôs different than the BP due to the lower proof but is much more complex. It has nose that is almost like a vanilla or honey dutchmaster, with undertones of berries, chocolate along with subtle oak. The palate is sweet at first with notes of berries, honey and chocolate right off the bat. You taste the sweetness throughout but the finish is oakier with hints of tobacco. 

I think ECBP is a value buy at the $70-$80 and EC18 is worth the money at $150. I really enjoyed the 18 and would be willing to pay up to $200 if I see it again. You lose some mouthfeel compared to the BP but it makes up for it. I‚Äôm not an expert by any means but this has been one of the most complex, smooth sippers I‚Äôve had. 8.9/10","I passed on this once and it haunts me.
I really love it. Obviously it‚Äôs a compromise on proof but it is just so well balanced and the dark notes and complexity are there in ways I‚Äôve never found in ECBP. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth that much more than Msrp but considering what bottles sell for 150 every day of the week that this crushes it get a bit of a bad rap I think.
Good review‚Ä¶. But uh‚Ä¶. Did you just pull out a vanilla duchie reference for a bourbon review?? Lol love it!
Thanks for the review! I just found one myself recently. About a week later found another one and bought for my brother. I have heard some of the negative reviews but I am on your side where every ecbp or sib I have ever tried has been top-notch. Well worth the money.. I was willing to spend the 160 I paid. Enjoy it, and thank you so much for your thoughts!
Prepare to be disappointed
If you mix this with some ECBP its amazing. Almost like the old pirate bottles IMO
These are single barrels so if you‚Äôve had one you liked, odds are you might not like the one you find
Huge fan as well but this is the one I really have hesitation on because of the proof with the price tag. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fantastic but I just know I‚Äôll want more out of it. Enjoy!
It's mid
I love EC and every BP is a must buy for me.
I picked up an ec18 last year and was so stoked to get it for msrp. Waited for a special occasion to pop it‚Ä¶ most disappointing pour of my life.
It has an after taste that is ‚Äúmoldy bread‚Äù or ‚Äúmossy‚Äù to me that is a total turn off.
I share it now with any friends who want a taste - but once it‚Äôs gone I won‚Äôt replace it. Still love the ECBP though.
Bottle I have is ok‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs better barrels out there.
I know the feeling. Hopefully you catch one soon
I had a taste and while it‚Äôs a good bourbon, it‚Äôs absolutely not worth hunting for. Proof is too low and it‚Äôs over-oaked.
Yeah I‚Äôm in the same boat. $200 is probably a bit of a stretch.
Yep it‚Äôs all I could think of after the first whiff lol
Thanks man, I agree. If you like EC it‚Äôs definitely worth it.
Wow that‚Äôs a great idea. I have some ECBP so will try it tonight. Thanks for the recommendation!
Yep, seems to be the consensus that it is a hit or miss bottle. Single barrel and 18 years can vary the juice quite a bit. I probably got lucky with this one
I hear you on that, ECBP is honestly a better value. But if you like EC I think it‚Äôs worth a try. They took 18 yrs to make it so that‚Äôs gotta be worth something lol
Sorry to hear that. I‚Äôve heard every barrel differs quite a bit. Overall I think ECBP is a better buy. I didn‚Äôt get any of the notes you mentioned but will be on the lookout next time I have a pour
This is the way. I had a pour of EC18at a friends place and felt the same exact way. Also had KC18 as the next taster and that was a much better 18yr bourbon.
I'd love to take credit for the idea, but I heard about it on r/bourbon first. I'm a fan of 100-110 proof whiskeys these days, so it works perfect for me, since it makes it taste older and lowers the proof a bit.
Hey if a single barrel is good, it‚Äôs a win right?
If I find someone with another bottle I‚Äôll give it a second try maybe.
This particular flavor - I can‚Äôt describe and I‚Äôve only ever tasted it 1 other time. I had a Rebel Cask strength bottle that was gifted and I loved. I bought a second that was a store pick and it had this same off flavor but much much stronger. On the Rebel this flavor would drowned out coke even if mixed and remains my only single ever drain pour to this day. It was a nauseating after taste.
My EC18 isn‚Äôt nearly as pronounced but it‚Äôs the same flavor.
Well thanks for sharing. 110 proof is the sweet spot for me.
Amen brotha
I hear you man. Give it another try if you get a chance but $150 is tough to justify if you‚Äôve had a bad experience"
Infinity Bottle Update 4 10/11,"Patch Notes:
+1.5oz OGD 114, +1.5oz Russell‚Äôs 10yr SiB, +1.5oz MM Prvt STV:21043, +1.5oz Old Forester 1920, +1.5oz Liberty Pole Wheated, -2.5oz for Tasting

Proof: 107.7 | Official Age: 50 days

Tried tasting & nosing it, but the complexity isn‚Äôt there compared to last taste. I think i nees to stop doing taste tests right after adding bottles. It hasn‚Äôt blended yet & the complexity gets lost from other tastes. 

I had a taste with a friend on 10/2 and it was significantly better / more complex. 

Kind of disappointing for tonight. I will revisit this with just a taste after some time.","My infinity has 23 bottles in it at 1oz each. Like 104 proof. And good but not great.
i don‚Äôt even know/remember what‚Äôs in mine at this point  nor the proof. but it tastes good i guess.
What‚Äôs the point of this?
Cool! What are the bottles? Have you learned anything about which ones mix well?
I use the Infinity Bottle IOS app. It tracks all that for you, and makes the graphic in 2nd picture if you‚Äôre interested, but as long as you enjoy it that‚Äôs all that really matters. I‚Äôve been kind of using mine as a way to track the bottles i like, and as a blending experiment.
It‚Äôs interesting to me to see how the flavors mix. I mean blending is it‚Äôs own art & there are whole companies dedicated to it. I‚Äôm not a expert blender though, so i use it more as a like a log of the bottles i‚Äôve owned, and its a mix unique to my collection. I think it‚Äôs a cool thing to do with that ounce in the bottle before it is finished. I realize some people would think it‚Äôs a waste or pointless.
I'd have to look at my notebook. I have it all written down. It's very sweet though. I thought about adding a couple Oz of a high proof to proof it up a bit but haven't gotten around to it yet
Nice, let me know when you have time, i‚Äôm curious. Mine sits around 105 proof pretty consistently. I drink a good bit of 100+ proof so it goes in often."
Couldn‚Äôt pass on this store pick and NOT compare it to my favorite bottle,"This isn‚Äôt a super in depth review, more just me sharing what I notice about them comparing the two. 

BEP is by far my favorite whiskey I‚Äôve ever tried. Despite the higher proof it‚Äôs absurdly easy to drink without as much heat as you‚Äôd expect for a cask strength bottle. It‚Äôs pretty sweet but not in the sickly sweet caramel way a lot of bourbon is. I think the last flavor description of Sweet Spice on the label is a great way to describe it along with being very oaky. The Trevor‚Äôs store pick on the other hand has almost no sweetness to it. Theres quite a bit more heat to it despite being lower proof, but it‚Äôs not unpleasant at all. Both are absolutely fantastic in their own ways, and I‚Äôm for sure going to be picking up more store picks of this whenever I see it. BEP is still my favorite without question, but it‚Äôs good to know how good their private selection store picks are for when BEP is gone for good. 

If you ever get the chance I‚Äôd strongly recommend picking up BEP while it‚Äôs still available if you see it for around MSRP. It‚Äôs a bottle I could pretty easily recommend to someone wanting something to start exploring more complex whiskies that are higher proof without being too concerned that the heat will be too much. I probably couldn‚Äôt recommend the private selection to someone like that though, although I would absolutely recommend picking up a store pick of it if you ever get the chance.","Shout-out to Trevor's.  That place is awesome
Makers store picks are so good"
Rate my set up,Tell me what you‚Äôve tried I‚Äôd be eager to hear tasting notes etc. some bottles I‚Äôve tasted here some are still corked looked for a spare.,"Lacking, high center of gravity. One bump and disaster. Also, direct sun light can obliterate the expensive whiskey you haven‚Äôt opened.
Looks like you need some Blanton's.
Your setup sucks... Those are a bunch of expensive bottles on a tall skinny pedestal. Don't let anyone run into it.
Looks like you've got $3000 worth of whiskey on a $20 IKEA shelf. 6/10
3/10.. to many sealed bottles lol..
Setup is as bad as your camera
How strong is that cabinet? I would cry if that collapsed.
You not playing anymore u/CopperStillsandMash ‚Ä¶.or just losing your touch?
Not sure what room this is in, but in general I think it looks kinda trashy having a shelf of alcohol out in the open. The exception would obviously be a bar, or a bar cart.

Solid bottles though.
10/10 taters would love this
Nice starter bottles.  Glad to see you haven‚Äôt got sucked into buying too much inferior craft whiskey, stick to legacy distillers they do it better overall.  But as others have said I‚Äôd enclose all bottles from any and all
light.
Which EC and Bookers do you have?
Direct sunlight is not a good place to store your bottles.
Risky proposition with those tall skinny shelves. I‚Äôve had shelves like that with just books and ceramics on them, that tanked and busted up some of my hand-thrown pieces. Be careful (maybe wall-anchor that thing). Otherwise, move to something larger and more sturdy long term, maybe something built-in.

Also, branch out from bourbon. There‚Äôs a whole world of whisk(e)y to explore‚Ä¶..not that bourbon isn‚Äôt great, though. The bottles you have there are some nice bottles.
Beautiful.

Some pictures from Japan Whisky Stories Fukuoka whisky festival.,"It was a first time, one day event and was sold out. Tickets sold for 3300 yen (about $22).The hall had a 500 person capacity, but it felt over. All the Japanese major and minor distillers were there. They gave away free samples (about 1 ml size) of many of their more recent bottle releases. Some had a couple of bottles to sample, while others had 6-10 samples to try. Chichibu (Ichrio's Malt) was one of the most generous, with 10 different bottles to try. But there were a lot of new Japanese distilleries showing off their early (new make) spirits. 
They had a bottle lottery for all attendees. A limited edition Mars bottle (they had 24 out of 198 bottles in the release). I was lucky enough to score one. Had to pay about $150 for it, but well worth it.
Besides the distillers showing off their stuff a lot of bars from all over Japan set up tables to taste rare whiskies from their collection, for a price. You could spend anywhere from 100 yen on a 1970's Suntory Old & Rare (note it's not old, nor rare) , to about 5,000 yen for a sample of a Karuizawa 30 (which is quite rare - whole bottles sell for $5,000 and up these days).",">They gave away free samples (about 1 ml size) 

Was that 1 cl (10 ml) size, perhaps?

I really like smaller pours and with practice have gotten down to the point where I can get decent mileage out a 5 ml pour, but even I would struggle to make much of a 1 ml pour. Plus I'm really curious to see what the bottle or glass looks like, which is that miniature.

Sounds like a great event, thanks for the writeup.
They would just pour from the bottle into these tiny cups. One of the pictures (the Kannosuke bottle) shows the cup and pour. These were mainly to get a taste. Though if you bought from the bars that brought their rare items, you got a bigger pour.
That looks like about 5 - 7 ml to me in that picture.

If you are wondering how I have a sense of the volume of tiny pours, it comes from taking commercially sold 30 ml samplers and splitting them up into 3-6 different tasting sessions.

Mostly I'm just joking with you, of course. 

Did you spring for the Karuizawa 30 sample? If I'm converting correctly from yen to $ that would have been about $33, which sounds like a very attractive price to me.

Cheers
Didn't get to spring for the Karuizawa. Tried a Mars Komagatake 30 sherry cask for about 1/2 that price. And a couple of other dusty bottles that I had in my own collection, but haven't opened yet (Nikka Selection, Nikka - The Blend of Maltbase 17) that I was curious to see if I should keep or trade for something else. The rest were the free samples."
"My Whiskey Journey: What I've tried, what I've liked, what I haven't, and what's next?","Howdy all!

I am still rather new to the whiskey community, having just really become able to afford a bottle here or there to try and enjoy. I've embarked on this journey with my Fiance, and in the last 6 months we've tried a grand total of 12 bottles, from all across the whiskey spectrum. Those 12 bottles, in order of purchase, are:

1. Suntory Toki
2. Woodford Reserve Double Oaked
3. Ardbeg 10 Year
4. The Glenlivet Carribean Reserve
5. Glenmorangie 14 Quinta Ruban
6. Bruichladdich The Classic Laddie
7. Kaiyo Mizunara Cask Strength
8. Old Forester 1920 Prohibition Style
9. Willett Straight Rye 4 Year Cask Strength (my bottle is 104.2 proof)
10. Nikka Whisky From The Barrel
11. Yellowstone Single Malt (Green label, 108 proof)
12. Lagavulin 16 (Just bought+opened this bottle, enjoying my first dram as I write this post!)

&#x200B;

[All of the bottles I've had so far, minus the Kaiyo Bottle, which I cannot seem to find :\(](https://preview.redd.it/k8megruujvsb1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84d138d5014ed68f701803852006dffa2723e2c4)

Now, the reason I write this post is two-fold: first to detail what led me on this seemingly odd path through whiskeydom in hopes to encourage others who may be scared to get started, and second to get some recommendations from the community on where to go! Feel free to skip sections if you want, of course!

**My journey through all 12 Whiskeys:**

When I started out, I was like many: I just watched YouTube videos about Whiskey - Brewzle, Whiskey Tribe, you know the deal. My Father and Grandfather both liked whiskey, but never had the money that I do for any of the 'finer' things. My dad was a Jack Daniels Old No. 7 fan, and my Grandfather enjoyed himself a bottle of Johnny Walker Black from time to time. I've never had the chance to drink with either of them, as my dad quit drinking years ago and my Grandfather passed away before I was legal age. So in a way, my journey into whiskey was a way to connect to and remember him.

My first trip ever to a liquor store had me purchase the first two bottles on this list, Suntory Toki and Woodford Reserve Double Oaked. I wanted two whiskeys that were comfortably different, but also widely considered inoffensive. Suntory Toki served a double-purpose, as my research said at the time it was a good intro into two worlds of whiskey at the same time: japanese whiskey and scotch. Woodford Double Oaked was just what came up when I looked for the sweetest whiskeys, as I knew I'd need something sweet for my Fiance to not be scared off right away.

Surprisingly, she liked the Toki and myself the Woodford. Not that either of us disliked either whiskey. I came to love the woodiness and caramel notes of the Woodford, and the honey notes in Suntory. She was also a fan of those honey notes, which would help us with one of our picks later on.

From there, we moved into the world of smokey scotches, which was a jump for sure but exactly what we wanted, a big risk that would let us know for sure whether that was our ""thing"" or not, and worst case, we both had a least one bottle we liked already. That led us to the Ardbeg 10, which was the cheapest islay scotch widely available near us. It took some warming up to, but both of us liked its smoke-forward palette. At this point, we still struggled to get past the first one or two tasting notes, but didn't really care too much. We tasted it, and we liked it. The rest would come!

The next trip saw three more scotch purchases, mostly bought on impulse and not necessarily any methodical research. I knew I wanted to try a scotch finished in a wine cask. I also know port is sweet and heavy on dark fruit, so the port-finished Quinta Ruban seemed like a good gamble. The Glenlivet was a purchase hoping to find molasses notes. The Bruichladdich was purchased at the advice of someone I had asked about a non-smokey Islay scotch to try.

Of those 3 bottles, the Quinta Ruban was by far my favorite. It's delightfully full-bodied while being relatively light, sweet, and inoffensive. There's virtually no burn, and very clear plummy and dark fruit notes that I personally enjoyed a lot. My Fiance preferred the Classic Laddie out of the three, though she never really said why, and I never really asked.

Both of us were somewhat disappointed by the Glenlivet. For both of us, taking a sip didn't inspire much of a reaction aside from ""yup, that's whiskey."" Needless to say, it was the go-to to mix into some tea when we both got sick a couple months ago.

The next set we bought was the Kaiyo and Old Forester 1920, which was honestly just an evolution of our first ever trip. The Kaiyo was often reviewed as very honey-forward (a hype that it definitely lived up to), and the Old Forester 1920 was cited by some on this forum as a good choice for people looking for a WRDO alternative.

Both were a hit for both of us! The Kaiyo was really just fantastic. It's a light barrel proof, coming in at just 106, but was wonderfully honey-forward with hints of buttered biscuits. I imagine if you liquefied the tip of one of those honey-dipper wands, it would taste something like the Kaiyo. The OF1920 was good, but admittedly not the WRDO competitor I was expecting. It's much darker, and slightly more bitter. The tannin really shines in this dram, and it drinks dryer than even some wines I've had. Good in it's own way, but hardly another WRDO.

The Willett was my first allocated bottle, and my first rye. It also happens to be maybe my most favorite bottle so far. Depending on your mindset going in, you can have a different experience with every sip. It's very spicy, coats the mouth well, and follows up the spice with some rye dryness and dark fruit notes. I personally get cinnamon and raisins, but I know mileage varies wildly on this one, especially since some get batches pushing 120 or 125 proof of this stuff, and mine was only 104.2. I'd love to try one of those higher-proof bottles of this somewhat polarizing bottle that I happen to love.

The Nikka was another bottle in the Japanese train that many said was a great entry level blend, and I must say I agree on that point. I've not had too much of this one, but my Fiance has. It has the same honey notes as the other Japanese whiskeys we've tried, while being a more well-rounded experience with some more woodiness than the others we've had.

The Yellowstone was another impulse buy for me. I knew literally nothing about this bottle, and if I'm being honest, just bought it because I like nature and the idea of Yellowstone Park. It has nothing to do with the Whiskey, I know, but I was not disappointed with the bottle. It's inoffensive, and overall exactly what you'd expect from a single malt whiskey. It's not that complex, and I can't really pick it apart. I'm through half the bottle, and I can't give you any tasting notes. I haven't really tried, but the simplicity of it almost makes me not want to, and I'm okay with that. I just enjoy it for what it is.

As a live first impression, I just got a bottle of Lagavulin 16 that I'm trying as I write this post. Since we polished off the Ardbeg that we both enjoyed about a month ago, I've been craving another smokey whiskey. In my light research, I honed in on Lagavulin as an option that was still smoke-forward as you would expect from an Islay, but more complex than something that's really just a bottle of campfire like Ardbeg and Laphroaig 10. So far, I like it. It has a little bit of woodiness behind the smoke, with a pleasant sweetness that the Ardbeg lacked.

So, after all that:

**What did we like?**

Honey. We're both big honey fans, and generally are more likely to enjoy things that lean toward the sweeter side of things. We also both enjoy dark fruits, and some wood notes, generically.

The Kaiyo was a clear winner between both of us, as we both really fell in love with how light but satisfying it was. Nothing about it forced you to pay attention, but when you did, you found more complexity and more to love.

Aside from the Kaiyo, my favorite has to be the Willett Rye, followed closely by the Quinta Ruban and WRDO. Her favorites after the Kaiyo are the Toki and Ardbeg (She hasn't tried the Lagavulin, so that may change).

**What didn't we like?**

That damn Glenlivet. We both wanted to much to like it, but nothing about it was enjoyable for either of us. We were both looking forward to the molasses notes or sweetness we expected from rum barrels, and didn't get it. It drinks hot for its proof and isn't very sweet or tropical like it says on the bottle. Not sure what went wrong here, but it did.

I also wasn't a huge fan of the Classic Laddie. I can't point to a specific thing I didn't like, it was just a little to attention-grabby in a not-so-nice way. I feel like it drinks a little hot and the flavors I'm getting don't go well with the mid-pallet sweetness I get from it.

She was not a fan of the Willett, as it was too dry for her to drink with any regularity. She said she'd drink it as an occasion beverage, and that it suits a certain mood, but she'd need to be in the mood to drink it, which has only happened once in the month since I've gotten the bottle.

**What did we learn?**

Prioritize enjoyment! If you like it, you like it, and if you don't, you don't. That's okay! You also don't have to know exactly why you do or don't like something. I like the Yellowstone I have, but couldn't tell you why even after half a bottle- and honestly, not being able to tell why I like it is part of the reason I like it. That being said, getting some basic common notes (oak, dark fruits, honey, spices) can be beneficial to choose whiskeys you won't be disappointed by with better, though not perfect regularity. Our impressions of what we are *generically* interested has luckily resulted in 0 of our 12 bottles being drain pours, which I honestly count as a win.

And adjacent to that point, don't be scared to explore! I know some of these bottles are quite expensive, but if you have some basics and do a little research, I think you too can find a method to the madness and also achieve a 0% drain pour record! I'm sure my own no-drain-pour record will be broken at some point, but as long as I choose bottles that have some honey notes, dark fruit, or woodiness somewhere, I don't think I'll ever have a problem with the bottle.

**What's next?**

Well-that's why I'm here! With everything you've learned about me so far...what would you recommend? I want to explore some more budget options here in Ohio. The $34 Toki is in the right ballpark, but I'd like a go-to bourbon and scotch that also find themselves in that $20-$35 range that I feel would be just right for a decent-quality daily driver.

We are also looking to splurge on a bottle as a move-in-gift to ourselves, as we just bought a house! We've eyeballed Yamazaki 12 and Kujira 20, but what are your recommendations given our tastes for a truly amazing experience in the $150-$500 range? I'm excited to see what you come up with.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Always remember, the best drink is what you like, how you like it!

Hope you enjoyed!

&#x200B;","Great write up, glad to hear you are having fun with it.

Don't get too discouraged by the comments regarding the length of your text - a lot of Reddit users browse the site using the mobile devices user interace, which is not very friendly to long form writing.

A few thoughts

1 Keep up with the spirit of exploration and having fun that you've been doing. Your pace (about 2 new whiskies per month) seems about right to me in the early stages of exploration, so long as you can afford it. 

At some point when you are more experienced you might want to cut back the number of new bottles so you can afford more expensive ones, purchased less frequently - especially so in scotch, good ones of which tend to cost more $ than do good bourbons. I find that scotches are more rewarding when you get above $100, than are the highly chased after and allocated bourbons which are in that elevated price range (IMHO, to my taste). In other words, I buy bourbon below $100 and scotch above that.

2  Regarding where to go next, it seems like you've developed several different likings - for sweeter whiskies, for peated scotches, for the dark fruity flavors of the Glenmorangie QR.

This gives you a wide variety of different paths to explore. I rec using the r/scotch malt flavor map in their right sidebar as a guide to scotch flavors, see here:

https://scotchgit.bitbucket.io/

and see this proposed update to that map:

www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/10ium09/an_attempt_at_an_updated_malt_map_thoughts/

For exploring American whiskies, I rec using a family tree which organizes them by producer - to my taste bourbons & ryes tend to cluster in flavor by their producer, possibly because they use proprietary yeasts which influence the flavors. 

Thus I rec exploring bourbons & ryes systematically by producer, picking 1 or 2 per producer out of what is available and affordable in your area, and not chasing unicorns. I rec this older but well organized tree for planning that campaign:

www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/71xcl0/bourbon_tree/

It does not surprise me that the Glenlivet CR was disappointing. I'm not a fan of younger & inexpensive Glenlivets, I think their flavor profile requires either more age or a very aggressive cask, to tame Glenlivet's rather high toned (solvent-y) character.

A better choice IMHO for showing what ex-bourbon cask unpeated scotch can do would be Deanston 12 or Old Pulteney 15. Deanston is a bit honeyed in character, the Old Pulteney has green fruity flavors and a slightly salty maritime tang.

The other scotch profile which you have not tried yet which is popping out to my eye is salty-peaty. 

Talisker 10 is a great example of that style, or if you want something a bit tamer and less aggressive then Johnnie Walker Green Label 15 (which is a blended malt, meaning it is made up only of single malts, mainly Talisker, Caol Ila, Cragganmore, and Linkwood).

If you want something a bit more budget friendly, Johnnie Walker Swing is a blended scotch whisky (so it contains some grain whisky) which is close in flavor to Green Label.

And for sweeter whiskies, give Irish a try, IMHO a good initial choice would be Green Spot, as you like lighter whiskies (like the Toki) and sweeter ones - it fits that pattern.

Welcome, and best wishes for your explorations!
Wild Turkey 101
Old Forester 1910 is more analogous to the Woodford Double Oaked, rather than the 1920.
Note: I am a bourbon guy, i like the sweeter flavors, so my recommendations are based on that.  (I tend to lean towards things with a fruit flavor like the buffalo trace products)

I would recommend you pick up Old Forester 86, or 100, if the proof isn't too much for you.  Those are both cheap bottles, and have a sweet flavor, but also people tend to find banana on the palate. If you like that, there's a bunch of other old forester products that are wonderful. (Like the Old forester 1910, which is similar to Woodford double oaked, but is also $55).

The bourbon that got me into everything was Buffalo Trace. It's cheap, when you can find it ($25). But is allocated in certain locations. sweet flavors, very round flavors.

Also expensive, but runs that almost scotch, almost bourbon, is High West's Campfire. I hate the smoky flavors, but it's bourbon-y enough for me to be okay with it. You mentioned you liked some scotch, so maybe that'll be good.

If you like japanese whiskey, like toki, you may enjoy other malty whiskeys like Nikka, or pay a bunch more and get the Hibiki. 

1792 small batch is a fine bourbon, available everywhere and pretty cheap as well. If you like that you can graduate to 1792 full proof, Bottled in bond, or high rye.

and everyone tends to say go for some evan williams bottled in bond (white label). Cheap and good. If you like that and live in the kentucky area, evan williams single barrel is supposed to be great. 

I'm not a huge wild turkey guy, but Wild Turkey 101 is supposed to be good and cheap. If you like that you can graduate to Wild Turkey Rare Breed.

And i'd recommend getting something from Makers Mark. It'll let you know if you're okay with wheaters. If you like that you can graduate to things like Elijah craig, Weller (special reserve and above), and Larceny.   


If you're like me and like the fruity style buffalo trace products, and live in an area that has more than just one type of the Benchmark series (Top Floor, Small Batch, Bonded, Full Proof, single barrel)  Go with the bonded. These are all cheap, and tend to be widely available, if you live in a market that has them.

If you like herby, spice, and floral, you may enjoy four roses. if you like that you can graduate to, small batch select, or single barrel.
Get Redbreast 12 cask strength. Its super sweet and fruity you will love it
I like the way you reflect your journey. And its an interesting read.

I navigate my journey with Davis Broom: The world atlas of Whisky. Might be for you to compare and plan your next steps... or just general orientation in Whisky. There is a famous flavor map in there and an extensive compilation of tasting notes on any relevant distillery (as of 2014 ... and its Scotch centric.) But there a flavor maps on the internet and other ways to find independet & consistent tasting notes.

&#x200B;

Some thoughts reading this (from a Scotch drinker).

For Honey and floral ... some malty & herbal notes :

\* Deanston 12 !

&#x200B;

Yes, Laddie is a bit rough around the edges. I like it ... but thats ""special interest"".

Some ideas for softer examples of the ""light&floral"" camp:

\* Compass Box Orchard House

\* Linkwood (Flora & Fauna Edition or any IBs from bourbon casks)

\* Amorik Classic

&#x200B;

More complex peaty Whiskys:

\* Caol Ila (different smoke, nice bourbon cask aromas ... citrus, maritime notes; interesting IBs)

\* Bunnahabhain Cruach Mh√≤na (nice bold + complex aromas from malty destilate and bourbon casks)... more on the sherry side:

\* Kilchoman Sanaig (in-your-face dark-fruit sherry finish)\* Lagavulin Disitllers Edition (Lagavulin + sherry finish)

(I always recommend Isle of Raasay ... but if Laddie not for you, the rough edges around their current bottlings won't be for you. Wait 5-10years untill they can release older stock)
You should try Compass Box Orchard House.
This is a great post.   Glad to read.   Enjoy the journey.
Based on your preferences I would propose trying a mid-tier Irish like Redbreast 12 or Green Spot. 

Another one that I think someone mentioned that you may really enjoy is the Kilchoman Saniag. It is very fruity and honey forward and the Islay smoke is not overpowering.
Hey dude, I didn't read all of your massive text but if you like honey and fruityness, try Arran 10 or Clynelish 14. Marvellous whiskies.
A lot of words
Powers Gold Label Irish is a good cheapie. Sweet like honey and I like it as much or better than other more popular Irish.
Buffalo Trace is sweet and approachable (cheap if you‚Äôre in the right region of the us).
OF 1910 is the most comparable whiskey to WR Double Oaked I‚Äôve found, both are great.
Can‚Äôt help you on the scotch too much as I haven‚Äôt had much and don‚Äôt really like it, but Macallan 12 was light and fruity, and Johnnie Walker Black is ok with mostly cereal notes and (to me) very faint smoke.
Fruity bourbon, try Four Roses Small Batch Select. Can also find port finishes like Isaac Bowman or Angels Envy, etc.
I agree with getting Larceny or Makers Mark for wheat bourbons to try that taste, different twist and you may really like it.
Wow- thanks for your extensive response! There's a lot for me to look at, and I really appreciate you putting the effort into it. Ill give a look to those family trees and do a little bit of poking around. 

Do you have a recommendation for that house break-in bottle?
Thanks for the recs! I've been pointed to 1792 a couple of times, same with the Evan Williams BIB and WT101. I'll have to add each of them to the list of to-buys.
You bet- but feel free to skip around. I labeled with headers for that purpose, and the first narrative bit was just me having some fun, I dont *actually* expect anyone to read that.
Be careful with higher end Japanese whiskies, many of them are so-called ""fake Japanese whisky"" meaning either they were not distilled in Japan (they are imported scotch or Canadian whisky which is bottled in Japan but not made there) or they are high proof barrel aged Shochu.

See this article to spec them out:

https://www.nomunication.jp/2018/07/06/infographic-japanese-whisky-real-or-fake/

For a super expensive celebratory bottle I think that for now you will probably enjoy one that is lower in proof - so parse recs from deep dive whisky hobbyists with care, because a lot of the bottles which are beloved on Reddit are very high in ABV%, either barrel proof bourbons or cask strength scotches. And those will probably not be very appealing to you at your current level of experience, they may taste like rocket fuel.

I rec getting Redbreast 21 if you can find it locally for around $400 or less, this link below may help with shopping it (customize the Shop Location filters to fit your state, and check ON the *Include stores that ship to state* checkbox):

Or if you are feeling adventurous enough to place an overseas online order, I rec the unpeated single malt scotch Glenfarclas 185th Anniversary, which is almost impossible to get in the USA but can be ordered from the UK, such as here:

https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/60603/glenfarclas-185th-anniversary

(if you shop this site, be sure to check out their 30ml samplers)

or here:

https://www.nickollsandperks.co.uk/product/32991

or it can be picked up at monthly UK whisky auctions for about ¬£75-¬£85 plus fees.

Even after adding in the cost of shipping a bottle from the UK to the USA it will run you less than $200, which is to my taste one of the best bargains in ultra-premium scotch to be found in today's market - it contains casks from 6 different decades going all the way back to the 1960s, so there is some 40 to 50 year old malt in this bottling, and to me it tastes like a 30+ year old scotch, but for a bargain price as those go.

It reminds me of potpourri and fruity herbal teas and I strongly concur with the tasting notes at this review:

https://www.whiskynotes.be/2021/glenfarclas/glenfarclas-185th-anniversary/

Of those two I just mentioned, the Redbreast 21 will be sweeter and probably a better fit for your current tastes, the Glenfarclas 185 will be more floral & herbal in flavor, but a chance to explore much older scotches at an affordable price vs. what else is currently on the market.

Cheers
i think it's really important to try all of the ""Lower tier"" bottles of different distilleries, this way you know what you like. This way you know what you can grow into because there's always something great similar to those lower tier bottles.   


You'll also find you gravitate towards a particular proof range.  I've had the high proof whiskeys and i tend to like the sub 110 mark.
Thanks for the recs! Really appreciate it!
Of the higher proof stuff I've had so far, I find I'm happy in the 100-120 range. Anything more than that and I'd probably be looking at something like A'bunadh, which Ive been eyeballing quite intensely these days."
Review: Macallan 25 Sherry Cask Terminus Edition,"Nose: Iodine, Sherry, Hints of campfire. 
Palate: Smooth...can definitely taste that sherry casking. Dissimilar from the nose, this is solid scotch.
Finish: Smoothness to match the palate, then a slight burn. Some astringency, nothing crazy...just enough to make your mouth water for another sip.
Score: 86/100
Notes: Had the pleasure of drinking this at the Hotel Terminus in Bergen, Norway. Supposedly the best whisk(e)y bar in Norway, most likely correct. Very extensive scotch collection. Bar Amundsen worth the visit (ol' Mr. Amundsen himself showed up here). Be like Roald and go to Norway.",
Help me make a joke," My good friend just gave me a blantons and honestly,  I prefer my $10 Old Taylor over it. (It got better after resting but not good enough to justify the price). What whiskeys in the sub $30 range would make him question things in a blind tasting? I'm in Oregon, so everything is MSRP but we can't get your costco deals. What bourbons can I buy and screw with his perception of value?

Aside note, I much prefer ryes and he can't handle them. So I'm looking for a cheaper bottle that would make HIM question things.

EDIT: Perhaps joke was the wrong word choice for the title. The point was more of what might he like that he wouldn't have considered buying before for a blind tasting that's easily found and affordable. We are good friends and seemed like another reason to sit down together and try new whiskeys in a different way. My word choice was simply just poor.","Sounds like a good way to make sure he never gifts you a bottle again
Well seems to me he is a good friend to you, you on the other hand seem to be an asshole. Hope he wakes up one day and smells the roses.
Get a bottle of Screwball and that way there‚Äôs no confusion that you are a giant asshole.
That‚Äôs not a joke. That‚Äôs being an asshole. I can just picture you sitting there desperate to rub it in his face that ‚Äòackshully you seem to like the cheaper one better than your beloved bladtons!‚Äô With that shit eating grin on your face. YTA.
Willet family estate 4yr rye is a good start. 

My advice though is just to be honest with your friend but don't be an asshole about it. We all have different tastes and clearly you like a little more rye spice than the classic vanilla, caramel, oaky bourbon profiles
Your word choice isn‚Äôt poor. Your intent and motives are. You‚Äôre trying to gotcha a friend.
Wt 101, WT rare breed of u want close to $55, 1792 small batch, Russell‚Äôs reserve 10 yr, makers mark cask strength. Only ones under $30 are the 101 and 1792 but that gives the other options I‚Äôd use
Doesn't need to be sub $30 but reasonable for a pauper
I mean, regular Jim Beam isn't too shabby for under $30.  Bib and Tucker 6 year is like $45.   Maybe go with a 375ml of the Woodford Double Oaked which runs $28.
This is a great idea.  Honestly if more people did blind tasting the number of people paying more than $100 for a bottle of Bourbon would plummet, unless of course you buy the bottle for the little horsey on top then go for it.
Don't know why everyone is calling you an asshole for this, unless I am misunderstanding.. Are you simply arranging a blind tasting for your friend, with the Blantons mixed in, and you are having a hard time explaining it to us?

Or do you plan to put cheap whiskey into expensive bottles and try to trick him?
WT 101, Evan Williams BiB, Elijah Craig honestly isn't bad at all either. Throw a Benchmark single barrel and a KC9 in for good measure
1792, redwood empire Lost monarch, Evan Williams single barrel, Jefferson‚Äôs small batch, michters American blend or bourbon, old forester 100 proof or 86 proof. Big fan of mellow corn Wild turkey 101 and Evan Williams 100 proof but wouldn‚Äôt say they‚Äôre comparable to Blantons like the others I listed"
Four Roses Single Barrel BS 44-2F,"23 year old back again with another review! I will try to organize this one a little better.

Nose: Oak and vanilla forwards! Smells almost sweet. 6/10

Taste: Starts with a light vanilla and oaky tang that prepares you for a whirlwind of strong oak and vanilla flavors. It ends with a quiet symphony of a now stronger vanilla and weaker oak, there is also a hidden touch of cinnamon lurking in the back. 8/10

Mouthfeel: Smooth and silky that transitions into a more creamy finish. 8/10

Experience: Overall a very good experience and something I would purchase again! As my 2nd bottle of whiskey ever, I thoroughly enjoy this pour. 7.3/10","A shelf staple.  Consistently hits the notes you mention.  Benchmark Full Proof is a very similar profile at higher ABV, something you might enjoy if you find it in your area.
Ill look for it!"
Finally giving it a try,"Not a review, just wanted to share my thoughts on it more than anything.

I‚Äôve always seen everyone raving about WT 101 on here and in pretty much any community that talks about whiskey. I don‚Äôt know why but I kept putting off buying a bottle. There was always something on the shelf I wanted to try more at around the price point. Today I went into TW though to pick up two of my favorite inexpensive bourbons, Early Times BiB and Knob Creek, but saw this one sitting there. Decided to put back my Knob Creek since I‚Äôve had it and still have some of the 120 proof if I‚Äôm in the mood for it, and picked this up instead.

Sipping on it, I can definitely understand quite a bit of the hype for it, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs at this godly status so many people have elevated it to. It‚Äôs good, don‚Äôt get me wrong, especially for the price, but it doesn‚Äôt really scratch that itch for me if I‚Äôm wanting bourbon. With such a high rye mash bill, it leaves me not quite satisfied when I‚Äôm going in and wanting bourbon. To me it tastes kinda like a middle ground between bourbon and Rittenhouse rye. I think you could pretty easily swap it into many rye cocktails without much of an issue. 

I‚Äôll probably keep a bottle of it on hand, but it certainly isn‚Äôt going to replace Early Times BiB or Old Grand Dad 114 as my favorite for a budget bourbon","You never forget your first. Unless it was a wild night in France in 2006 and then you might.
And you had to shove it up Jeremy Clarkson‚Äôs nose? üòÇ
Good pairing
All we know is, he‚Äôs called The Stig.
The mashbill for Wild Turkey isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúhigh rye‚Äù‚Ä¶ It is 13% rye, which is exactly the same as the Knob Creek you mention. Additionally, you mention you like OGD114, which is actually significantly higher rye than both at 27%.
It's better on the rocks imo. Only bourbon found to like it better on rocks
Bracing for the downvotes as I say how horrible I thought it tasted. One of the very few I couldn‚Äôt enjoy. Wild Turkey Rare Breed is an entirely different bird (pun intended) and quite delicious.
It was‚Ä¶..



*Brilliant*
101 ain't bad but rare breed is where it's at
I like to make Manhattans with it.
Love WT101.
101 is ok. Not a fan of most WT products. Like it more than the bottle of rare breed I had. Rather go for RR or the SiB Kentucky spirit though.
For me some of the love for WT101 is it was one of the first whiskey I tried and liked. Nostalgia 30%. But once I tried lots of other whiskeys, I came back to WT101 and loved it more. ET and VOB I like as well, but given the change that 30% nostalgia will take me back to another 101 bottle. Rare Breed is simply amazing as well, but as others have said, it's WT101 on steroids.
R/oddlyspecific
I still cant drink tequila thanks to my wild night circa 2004.
What makes WT101 bad for you that is overcome with WTRB? I would have thought WTRB is just WT101, but everything is turned up a notch. I ask this because WT101 is not my favorite because of the high rye mashbill, but now I'm wondering if I should try WTRB.
Tried WT101 first didn't get the hype and thought it was disgusting. Tried Rare Breed and angels started singing!!!!! Doubled back to 101 and now I get the hype. It's pretty tasty for the price.
I agree and support this comment. Rare BreedüôåüèΩ
Dang, our tastes are very different. I like Russel's Reserve plenty, but when I blind it against Rare Breed it only wins about a third of the time, and I've had too many very ""meh"" bottles of Kentucky Spirit to even take the gamble on getting a good one anymore. 101 is kind of just a constant, I'll always enjoy it but it'll never blow me away.
My apologies, I didn‚Äôt see your question until now. Maybe the bottle went bad, or something as I had it at the same bar. Tried it twice because it was so well reviewed. For some reason it didn‚Äôt have any of the caramel, vanilla, oaky, fruity flavors I enjoy. Instead, it tasted kind of peaty. WTRB, was rich, viscous, and had many layers of the flavors (minus fruit) that I love. For the price, it‚Äôs worth giving a shot.
It‚Äôs something I won‚Äôt buy for my home bar, but if I were to get a pour elsewhere I wouldn‚Äôt be upset."
Kirkland 15 yo single malt whiskey,"Haven't found any thing online so here is my quick review.

This is Costco's single malt bottled at 46 abv, which is a decent proof in Scotch world. Price is $52, a decent price.

Color is amber on the dark side. The nose have a tiny bit of funk, taste is dominately sherry with a hint of sulfur. Very sweet but not very fruity, I would say between fruity and chocolate/cigar type of taste.

They didn't disclose with distillery but based on my guess this is very likely to be Tomatin.","I picked it up this weekend. Good flavors. Alcohol packs more of a punch than I would expect for 46%. Maybe because it was a fresh crack. I‚Äôm gonna let it open up a bit, but for $58 this is one of the best values in scotch
When did you get this?
In WA State that 54 a bottle is 71 with our temporarily permanent 20% alcohol sales tax
Unfortunately it‚Äôs 73.99 in Iowa.
I just saw this at my local Costco for $52.99.  Is this a good bottle?
Agree that packed more of a punch than I would expect for 46% but that was fresh crack. less sweet than I would have expected though did get it immediately on the front end. Seems like solid value to me.
If you look behind the bottle on bottom. It clearly says ‚Äúbottled for Alexander Murray & co‚Äù 
So it‚Äôs Alexander 15yr
I picked up 5 bottles today $52. Good tase IMO and for the price you can't beat it. There was only 1.5 cases and the CS desk said no more coming in.
last week
This was another benefit in moving out of WA.
How do you say temporarily permanent?
In Michigan this $54 bottle is state minimum $78.46 + 6% sales tax üòë
78.46 in Michigan (weird state min pricing)
For that price just grab one and try. I think for $53 it is very good!
I think AM is the bottling company. But idk which distillery made this single malt tho
It‚Äôs politician speak for a temporary tax that remains a permanent fixture 

Kinda like I‚Äôve never stolen anything I‚Äôve only temporarily borrowed on a permanent basis"
"""Canadian only"" whiskys","A few years ago, we moved from Michigan and our frequent trips to Canada became fewer and fewer, but now i'm back in the mitten, and I'd like to get back to visiting family in Ontario. I've only become passionate about whiskey for a month or so, and will be making a trip across the border in a couple weeks.  


I'm a slut for maple, and fell in love with the Sortilege brand. I've been on the lookout for the ""prestige"" version of this, but had no luck at the duty free stores.  


I've only ever visited the beer stores around there, so im curious where most people shop for liquor around the Windsor/Chatham area, and also looking for brands or finds that you can only find in Canada, as i dont feel like paying the crazy prices online to get it shipped.  


I enjoy most types liquor and im still finding my tastes, though my palate is more fond of sweeter notes such as butterscotch, maple, vanilla, caramel, etc.   


My current opened bottles I have here are Eagle rare, buffalo trace, window jane decadence, nikka coffey grain, barrell seagrass, bookers 23, and a few other ""average price point bourbons"".  


tl;dr - Looking for sweeter bourbon/whiskeys only available in canada, and which stores would be my best bet for liquor.","My go to Canadian Rye Whisky is the Lot no. 40 Dark Oak. You can get one at the LCBO here in Ontario for $60CAD. It‚Äôs smoother than their regular stuff, the charred oak casks really just give it a ton of extra character.
The thing about Ontario is that their liquor laws do not allow private liquor stores. There's the LCBO and that's it. Now, the LCBO is actually one of the largest purchasers of alcohol anywhere in the world, but it also means that the selection isn't really going to vary from place to place. 

Anyway, you're best bet for the widest selection is a Vintages store. 

Now, as for Canadian whisky, in my opinion this is the best there is:

[https://greatplainscraftspirits.com/](https://greatplainscraftspirits.com/)

&#x200B;

According to the LCBO, there are 6 bottles in Ontario, 2 in Toronto, 1 in Brampton.
Bridgeland distillery here in Calgary has a ""berbon"" made using local Taber corn that I hear is pretty good.
You might be able to find some interesting stuff at local distilleries depending on where in the province you go, I'm not too familiar with the windsor/chatham area other than JP wisers (big lower end place but might have an interesting distillery exclusive or two?) but in my area there's a few places that make a pretty nice bottle of whisky.

As for what you can find in the LCBO, if you can appreciate spicier notes alberta premium cask strength is on clearance for $65 and is great for that price, or if you only prefer sweet anything Lot 40 takes the typical canadian rye profile and makes it more balanced towards fruit and sweetness which I think you could enjoy
This is a great recommendation.

They also have a Port finished Cask Strength that is AMAZING if you can find it.
I'm sipping on Lot 40 Dark Oak and I type this, it is fantastic.
I'll keep an eye out, and in usd that's super cheap. Thanks for the recommendation.
This is good info, much appreciated.
Oh damn, I need to find that. The Glenmorangie 14yr Quinta Ruban is one of my favourites and it‚Äôs a Port-finished Scotch‚Ä¶"
Blue Note Uncut,"So I have been working in Alabama and live in California.. I have never seen Blue Note until I started working in Alabama. Read some reviews and heard it‚Äôs a great bottle but they say the ""Uncut"" blue note bottle is from the survivor barrels where the rickhouse collapsed and only a certain amount of barrels survived and are now store picked and labeled ""Uncut"" so I purchased a bottle..

Then after I also read that they have regular bottles that are store picks and also labeled ""Uncut"" but not the survivor barrels..
I'm just curious if anyone has information on what bottle is from the survival barrels or not.. 

Thanks","I was under the impression that all the uncut bottles were survivor barrels.
Blue Note uncut unfiltered store picks are some of my favorite store picks at that price point.  Full of flavor. As long as I can find them there will always be a spot for them on my bar.

This video is from the company talking a little bit about it. After watching it, I was always under the impression that they were all survivor barrels‚Ä¶ ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The survival bottles are from Rickhouse H supposedly.  But the bottle got is so good!!
This was pretty informative I never knew about this brand but saw their label popping up slowly but surely
From my knowledge, 'Uncut' means the bourbon hasn't been cut with water to lower the proof.
I can‚Äôt stand this. My wife got me a bottle for Father‚Äôs Day and we both hate‚Ä¶ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[deleted]
Thank you that was very helpful!
I‚Äôve been disappointed too. I think I bought this for the story and not the whiskey. Won‚Äôt make that mistake again. I think it just needed more time to mature. For what it‚Äôs worth this has been a great mixer especially for the John Collin‚Äôs cocktail. 2 oz bourbon 1 oz lemon juice 1 tsp simple syrup mix in a tall glass filled with ice and top with club soda.
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I was gonna say it blows out new riff SiB for a similar price point but looking at my local TW pricing, new riff single barrels appear to have gone up from ~$50 to $60.  I‚Äôll take a knob creek store pick at that price point any day of the week over a new riff SiB.
No problem! Cheers! ü•É"
Unpopular: Online whiskey reviewers are a joke‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôm a big fan of the 12yo (purple label) Tullamore D.E.W. whiskey, mostly because of it‚Äôs silky taste. So, I wanted some ‚Äúprofessional ‚Äú opinions before buying a 14yo single malt. So I went through 6, 7 reviews of the whiskey on YT. I ended up laughing at it as every single reviewer started listing totally different flavours they were tasing either on the nose or taking a sip. They mentioned practically all known fruits, spices and other flavours known to man. Apples, oranges, peaches, tropical fruits‚Ä¶. nuts, vanilla, caramel etc‚Ä¶ you name it, they called it. Some couldn‚Äôt praise it enough while other called it average‚Ä¶No consistency between them at all. So I‚Äôm asking you‚Ä¶ how is an interested consumer supposed to get any take-aways from this‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre all a big joke‚Ä¶","whiskey youtube is about finding someone that you like to watch/listen to coupled with hopefully having similar tastes.
What different palates taste different things?!
You've been looking for love in all the wrong places dude
Don‚Äôt pay attention to reviews or people‚Äôs opinions on sm. The best whiskey is the whiskey you enjoy the most.
I mean, it's their opinions. It seems that you do not have that much experience with whiskey as a whole, so it's understandable to go watch reviews, but most of these reviews online are meant or designed in an odd way to mostly appeal to those who have tried dozens or hundreds of bottles throughout their life. TLDR: Made for experienced whiskey drinkers unfortunately

People from channels like Whiskey Vault have been drinking whiskey and reviewing them for years or even decades, such as Ralfy, and if they list certain flavors, it's probably because their palate has become so accustomed to the taste of whiskey that they are able to spot these minute differences on the palate. Each reviewer has a different palate (that's just biology) and different palates mean different flavors, it's up to you to differentiate if you think that'll be a bottle worth buying in the end. Most whiskeys have a general hardline of similar characteristics that every reviewer will pick up, such as key profiles that of specific distilleries like Jim Beam, Macallan, Dalmore, etc.

I think you're being overly-cynical over people that are just reviewing whiskeys, just to review them and give their own opinions about. It's not that deep and if you want to laugh at them, I mean, more power to you with your Tullamore
Its almost like taste is completely subjective
I had a similar gut reaction to whiskey reviews until [I](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArizonaWhiskey/comments/16n4gea/uncle_nearest_single_barrel_2022_release_review/) [started](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArizonaWhiskey/comments/16jio56/larceny_small_batch_review/) [writing](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArizonaWhiskey/comments/16jiyzv/larceny_barrel_proof_batch_c921_review/) [my](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArizonaWhiskey/comments/16hyky1/russels_reserve_single_barrel_review/) [own](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArizonaWhiskey/comments/16fci1s/jack_daniels_single_barrel_barrel_proof_review/).

I sat down, developed a neurotic rating system that should have me in a padded cell, and started *really* tasting my own whiskeys. Some truly do have dozens of subtle flavors that play with your taste buds in interesting ways.

That said, this is a consumable and consumables are a subjective experience. That's the primary thing to keep in mind when reading reviews.

I recommend starting to write your own, just for you. It actually does help develop your sense of what you like, I'm not just saying it. Come up with your own rating system, and try to figure out something niche that you can do, but that you don't see often with other reviews. For example, I'm a writer so I try to describe the way drinking each whiskey makes me *feel*, the mood, the vibe, whatever you want to call it. It's just as subjective as taste, but I never see other reviewers attempting to describe it.

Cheers.
You expect everyone else to tell you how it is supposed to taste. 

Let me explain it to you. 
There are many different YouTube reviewers because there are many different palates out there. This how it is supposed to work. You take your tasting notes and compare it to these YouTubers and the ones that match your notes the closest is who you should use as a guide. 
It is subjective there is no right or wrong answer.
It's almost like people have different palates and preferences. Weird.
I stopped reading/listening to ""professional"" reviews. They all have an incentive to plug whatever they're drinking - the worst is people who sell their own single barrel picks and every pick is ""the best thing they've ever tasted."" 

The best opinion you can get is your own - go to a bar and try it. The second best opinion is that of your friends or a person you trust; third is a bartender (who actually drinks whiskey).
This is whiskey in a nutshell. Different people taste different things
Whiskey reviewers who get bottles/samples for free can‚Äôt be trusted to give an honest review
Honestly, anyone pulling out seven adjectives is talking out their ass. The bourbon/whiskey content market is saturated and many people are still attempting to make a living commentating on it. What ends up happening is FOMO and hype. 

I hated Ardbeg Uigeadail but I could tell it was quality. I've sink poured tater staples. It all comes down to what you enjoy.
I mean reviews are just that person's opinion. Unless that person is a big Irish drinker I'd take them with a grain of salt.
Take reviews with a grain of salt.
Online whiskey reviews are valuable if you find someone with a similar palate as you. Bourbon junkies recommendations I can take to the bank, they pretty much like the exact same stuff I do.
Not sure what you expected? Whiskey drinking isn't a science as much as it is an art. And like with many artistic interpretations fro. Critics, the aesthetician appreciation will differ between individuals. Usually only the very best of the best are what universally will be acclaimed and the very worst of the worst will be turned down.

I'm sure you really enjoy what you drink. That's great. It suits you pallete, and isn't that all that matters? Most likely it was never going to be the very best of the best where everyone trying it would give it rave reviews. Be happy that one of your fans wasn't turned down outright by everyone. Means you have a great drink that matches well with your pallete. Yay.

Also, tasting nodes are completely subjective. You do realize that leather, tobacco, various fruits, caramel, and spices aren't actually added to the whiskey? I know you know this, but the flavors we do associate come from our brain trying its hardest to take what it smells and associate it with something from our past. That something of course will very based on experiences. Honestly, what does it matter that there's no consistency in the smelling and tasting? I promise that what you taste and smell isn't the same as what I'd experience. Doesn't mean your experience is invalidated any more than mine. 

So, back to your point about whats the point in taking stock in online reviewers. I agree that many reviews won't be terribly helpful, except if you are trying to avoid bad brands/ experiences. If you want great experiences, then they are helpful there too, as you'd at least know what bottles have earned more unanimity among the tasters. Amd of you just want something good, then you know that the bottles that get mixed reviews, like your favorite, some good, most average, but all positive, well that gives you a point t of reference to try that new bottle.
What I don‚Äôt get is that everyone tastes differently but people go nuts for store picks and always seem to think the taste better.
I knew this was going to be a bad post when I saw ‚Äúsilky taste‚Äù.
I use medieval style judgment... üëç &  üëé
Before Covid a friend used to host scotch tastings with reps from the distilleries. Not saying they are trained whiskey makers, but these guys sample a LOT, including from other brands. One night we had Arran, Oban and a 3rd distillery I can‚Äôt recall. They do the tasting as an interactive ‚Äúwhat do YOU taste‚Äù, as opposed to here is what it tastes like. They all agreed that there are over 200 scents and flavours one can pick out, and likely more. They guide you through the scotch and their unique processes, which to me is the cool stuff. So yah, every bro on YT is going to taste something different, and that‚Äôs ok. Drink what you like.
It‚Äôs people trying to be posh, nothing more, nothing less.
Whiskey tasting is subjective, everyone is going to have a different opinion and pull out different tasting notes. The key is to find a reviewer who has a similar palate to you
[I‚Äôm not getting drunk, I‚Äôm an online whiskey consultant](https://media.tenor.com/wyfkHSFgMNYAAAAd/im-not-getting-drunk-im-an-online-whiskey-consultant.gif)
You should fix it. Become the greatest most consistent whiskey reviewer of all time and lead the poor confused masses yourself üëç
Hi, welcome to the whisky sub. You must be new here.
OP has a valid point.  In the world of wine reviews, sommeliers all taste pretty much the exact same things.  

That's the whole point. 

On the other hand,  ANYone can become a self-appointed ""whiskey reviewer"" so YMMV...
I get all of my whiskey information from Reddit. If the hive mind all loves one, then I‚Äôll like it. If it‚Äôs split, then I‚Äôll try it at a bar first. If everyone hates it, I‚Äôm probably not going to like it.

I‚Äôve also learned to not trust any review found on Google as most popular results are by big websites/names that are paid to review the product. I find Reddit a great, unfiltered source of information.
I don't trust those Whiskey reviewer, although, I sometimes watch them for fun.  I laugh whenever they encounter ""BANANA"" note.   Which banana are they talking about?  I grew from the Philippines and we have several varieties of bananas and they have distinct taste and smell of their own.
So you're mad because different people have different opinions?  Take a chill pill bro
I just find reviewers with a similar palate as me that are also entertaining. Right now Matt Porter ADHD Whiskey is my jam.
The Bullshitters are easy to spot.  The guys who know what they are normally talking about are also pretty obvious when they are bullshitting for whatever reason.  What is worse than listing different tasting notes, is listing strange notes that you know they stole from somebody else‚Äôs review.  Starlight Cigar ‚Äúbarnyard funk‚Äù is the one I know gets repeated.
I don't listen to them because my sense of smell and taste are completely messed up from catching the dreaded virus 3x in 3 years. Nothing tastes or smells the same anymore or even like what other people taste. 

I just go off what I know I like and don't like. I base new picks off similarities in mash bills.
Taste is totally subjective and based on so many different factors. Like what you had to eat today, what time of day, how long ago you brushed your teeth.  It can only be taken with a grain of salt. Someone's favorite might be your least favorite. I still think it's fun to watch and read what others think regardless
What did you expect? Every whiskey reviewer is ultimately just a random dude on the internet with an opinion. It‚Äôs not like wine where you at least need some formal training to be a sommelier. Just find a guy whose palate matches yours. Or ignore all reviews and buy what you want.
Horst Luning from whisky.com on youtube does it best imo. But I enjoy watching reviews after I‚Äôve made some observations of my own!
Ummmmmm you do know taste is subjective right? You might get notes on the nose,palate or finish that another person may not. They may like something and you might not.

YT and reviewed aren‚Äôt an echo chamber, 10 reviewers aren‚Äôt all going to give you the same review and all 10 aren‚Äôt going to enjoy the product in the glass.
The thing about tasting whiskey is it's all subjective and relative to your own experience. My wife and I can taste the same whiskey and come up with some common notes, but also some wildly different ones at times. And your palate and nose can totally be influenced depending on the weather, or if you've recently eaten something or had something else to drink. Without knowing exactly what the environmental variables were for each of these reviewers you watched, I'm not surprised they all came up with different notes, especially if it is a more complex whiskey.
Find a reviewer whose likes and dislikes align with yours, and who has similar enough notes to the ones you find.  It is subjective and very open to the power of suggestion, so you have to find those with similar experiences to your own and, if possible, similar tastes. Not easy but, if you don‚Äôt, individual reviews have very little relevance as to whether you should purchase something or not - ultimately it‚Äôs one person, one palate, I‚Äôm not sure what you expected.  

More generally speaking something like whiskybase offers a collation of scores from different people and, if many people have reviewed something and it‚Äôs scoring close to 90, chances are it‚Äôs pretty good.
Taste is subjective. Additionally the nose and palate are influenced not only by obvious factors like what you've eaten that day but also by climate, humidity, etc. 

So basically anything beyond the obvious tasting notes are not a solid indicator. But it can be a nice inspiration. I personally love watching a couple of reviews when I get a new bottle just to see what I can relate to. More often than not I don't get any of the notes but I just have a good time watching the reviewers talk about the whiskey and pick up some notes about the distillery or similar bottles. 
 Can recommend Whiskey Vault on YT :) 

Cheers!
As others have said, taste is subjective. I'm sure you and I would pick some similar notes and some different ones. To further wit, I have a couple of buddies with a whiskey podcast (The Whiskey Tangent). They started in 2019, and since then, they have found a couple of things when it comes to tasting. 1st, they make sure to taste without knowing the tasting notes- this makes them think, and if they can't pick out a flavor, the tasting notes will help them figure it out. It helps them for future tasting. What you eat can affect how you taste the whiskey. Similarly, what you have tasted right before can also affect how you taste a whiskey. They've tasted somethings in one episode and didn't like it; they tried again later and liked it. So it was the whiskey prior that disrupted their ability to taste. One thing could be a high ABV before tasting a lower ABV whiskey. Also, just how the prior whiskey coats your mouth..if nothing else, it's possible to find an average. Also, don't take them as gospel; you may find you agree with their assessment often, but maybe not all the time. But it gives you a good idea if you're going to like it, if they do..
Like with all tasting reviews. You find the reviewers that have similar pallets or you pick up on things that you like. For example, I don't always agree with breaking bourbon, but he is descriptive enough for me to make an educated guess on if I would like something.

That's also why you got to open your bottles. I have no respect for people with lots of unopened bottles.
Yeah, this. For me Ralfy was my guy, and I tend to use his reviews as my gold standard. He nailed exactly what I was tasting in Laphraoig 10 year and so I‚Äôve stuck with him. Haven‚Äôt been let down yet.
Yeah, but in the world of wine, sommeliers all taste pretty much the exact same things.  That's the whole point. 

So in a lot of ways, OP is right.  But ANYone can become a self-appointed ""whiskey reviewer""
It might even be people taste the same thing but describe it differently depending on their personality
My palate completely changed pre/post COVID as well
Thx, of course, that‚Äôs what I do‚Ä¶ just did a ‚Äúcheck‚Äù if everyone spat on it, I‚Äôd avoid it‚Ä¶ but it was really funny watching the whole thing
Absolutely agree‚Ä¶ and when someone takes a sip and start off with ‚Äú I can taste‚Ä¶‚Äù, that‚Äôs fine, but once you start off with ‚ÄúYOU can taste‚Ä¶‚Äù you‚Äôre hinting that you can actually define a taste of the whiskey, which applies in general‚Ä¶
Salt!? I tasted brine you idiot!
Very good explanation of what whiskey drinking is like. OP probably describes every other bottle as ""smooth"", ""silky"", or ""hot""
Love Ralfy, I like how he‚Äôd drink about a third of the bottle the night before and go off his notes he was taking while imbibing. You could always tell a good review by how far down the label he was
There have been many an evening where I will do a drink along with a Ralfy review in my basement bar.  

I love his Mellow Corn review.
There's a baseline for most of the reliable whiskey reviewers. There's plenty of sommeliers who argue one thing over the other in many instances, just like whiskey.

For example, most whiskey reviewers will describe Springbank as having the ""Campbeltown"" funk or being a ""dirty"" scotch due to the earthy and herbal profile that it may have and many whiskey drinkers will describe a sherry barrel Balvenie as ""hot, oakiness with dark raisins, etc."" which is something 90% of whiskey drinkers will agree on. Of course there's no certification necessarily for whiskey drinkers online but people like Ralfy, Whiskey Vault, Whiskey Tribe, etc. are very reliable reviewers for whiskey
There‚Äôs a range of taste that most wines from specific regions will express. Some palates will be more sensitive to certain flavors than others. Cat urine from Sauvignon Blanc is a pretty universal tasting note because it‚Äôs so over the top most can‚Äôt miss it, but green apple can be subjective as it can also appear as unripe pear, peach, etc.
They‚Äôve been proven fake in tests.
Overanalyzing a bit there I'm afraid
If you‚Äôre getting worked up over a YouTube whiskey channel addressing their audience members as ‚Äúyou‚Äù, then maybe ‚Äúyou‚Äù are the problem
""Brine? Ha. So basic. Celtic sea salt, or fluer du sel, are the principle tasking notes. Don't go tasting scotch if you are unable to detect the difference, noob."" - Snobs
Same.   I often grab a bottle I know he's reviewed so I'll be able to sip it with him.  I've found this fan site list helpful for those who follow him.  

https://ralfywhisky.webnode.be/ralfy/whisky/
As a new Scotch drinker, the difference between a whiskey having been aged in primarily sherry vs. oak casks is what I‚Äôm able to discern most readily. For me oak/vanilla vs. raisin is the giveaway.
Simms blind taste to get their certifications. They haven‚Äôt been ‚Äúproven wrong‚Äù that‚Äôs sort of the point. The designation of Sommeliers is so challenging because of the strenuous work to get there, but there are many who taste and experience the flavors they do, that‚Äôs why they are typically held to high esteem.
That‚Äôs a great start! Eventually, you‚Äôll be able to discern more flavor notes but that‚Äôs the joy of whiskey, the journey into art of tasting more from what you drink!
They‚Äôve literally gotten a white wine, dyed half of it red and they‚Äôve given different notes off the same wine"
Infinity Bottle Update 3 09/29,"Patch Notes:

Nose:
More pleasant than last time, way less astringent alcohol. Baking spices, Bananas foster, some mild oak.

Taste:
Drinks smooth for proof point, sweet corn upfront, lots of dried fruit in middle, oak and dark flavors similar to that of like a dark stout or porter in the finish. 

Defenitely improved from last tasting. Some of these have been pleasantly surprising. Crazy depth of flavors. The Journey continues.","New to this. Didn't know this was a thing
Me neither until recently, essentially just your own big unique blend. I thought it was a cool way to keep track of what i‚Äôve tried."
Heavy oak/vanilla Scotch recommendations,"I'm looking for a quality scotch with strong spicy/oaky and sweet/vanilla notes to keep permanently stocked in my bar. Being readily available is a plus so I don't have to worry about restocking, but I usually prefer ex-sherry casks so as long as I can find \~1 bottle/year it should be fine. Not too worried about price either since it'll be used sparingly. 

I used to keep a bottle of Macallan 15 triple cask for this which I was okay with at \~$100, but not nearly good enough to justify the $150+ I see now. I also feel like since they switched from the ""fine oak"" to ""triple cask"" label a few years ago the juice is slightly less oaky with slightly more orange-peel/fruity flavors, which is moving away from what I'm looking for. I'm sure there's some really great options out there but I'm not familiar enough with ex-bourbon casks and keep getting disappointed. 

Some options I've tried so far:

Balvenie 12 double wood - Really enjoyed this one but want something with a bit more punch and probably more age. Ideally would want something more vanilla forward but I like how the wood spices come through here. Would consider splurging on the 17yr if people think it's worth and fits what I'm looking for. 

Balvenie virgin oak - Absolutely hated this one. Tasted hot and young imo and I'm not a fan of the raw wood notes vs wood spices I get from the 12 and Mac 15. 

Glenmorangie Cadboll estate - Closer to the vanilla-forward profile I'm looking for, but is missing the spicy oak flavors and is overall more muted and bland than I would like. 

Writer's Tears - Similar issues as the Glenmorangie

Glenlivet 15 French Oak - Been years since I had it but I remember it being almost overwhelmingly vanilla forward at the time. Not sure about the wood/spicy notes at this point though. Might have to revisit this one. 

Let me hear your recommendations! I'd also be fine with going for two bottles, one that's more heavy on the oak/spices and one that's super heavy vanilla. Also, bonus points if someone recommends a super vanilla-forward bourbon - not what I'm looking for now but will need to be added to the bar at some point. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;","Deanston 18 is my rec.

Deanston shares some flavors in common with Balvenie (to my taste), both being honeyed, and Deanston has characteristic notes of sweet pastry and unbaked pie crust. Their 18 yo is a quintessential ex-bourbon cask unpeated scotch with some nice maturity to it, giving it strong vanilla notes but not the young notes you get in a less mature malt.

If you want something more like Macallan, then my rec is to look around for a nice Glengoyne - IMHO they tend to mimic the flavor of Macs similar in specs (cask type, age) at a more affordable price.

Good luck
Not sure where you are located but Fortnum and Mason has a Dailuane 8 year scotch that is incredible at a decent price point. Give that a shot if you can!
In the past I would have said Compass Box Oak Cross, but Spice Tree might still land in roughly the right place."

Finish: Friend who doesn‚Äôt like whisky says finish is non-repulsive, slightly bitter, peat Smoke). I find a little bit of earthiness not fully present in the pallet. More butterscotch sweetness.

Scotch - The Hearach - First Batch - Review (first time be kind),"Ecstatic to receive this whiskey after being such a lover of their gins and a frequent visitor to the Island of Harris. The name (which is hard to pronounce and has an extreme variation between locals from Harris) is after the Gaelic for someone from Harris.

I am by no means a connoisseur with the tasting but a long-time drinker and being Scottish should help with this below is my review using the format from another longer more detailed post that has already been done which I'd advise checking out from RumHam.

**Details**

46% ABV 12,313 bottles.

Batch information - worth checking out, so much detail MINIMUM 5 years -[https://harrisdistillery.com/pages/he-00001-23. ](https://harrisdistillery.com/pages/he-00001-23) . 

**Other details**

In my video you can see the full unboxing, it was beautifully done in their gin style etched bottling. Harris tweed label atleast in appearance. A story of the Island, process and people is included along with a coaster which was awesome. The box alone was a great part of the process.

**Nose:** Light smokiness / peatiness expected from the islands. I picked up on some florals and spices and feel the sweetness coming. I couldn't overly get the creaminess the local claimed she got on the nose but did on the taste.

**Taste:** Lots of malty goodness and the initial hit was peaty, I felt the spice was more subdued that the nosing, but a well rounded flavour which really gets me excited for future more maturebottles. 

**Finish:** Very smooth finish especially with water, the sweetness, honey really settled by the end and I can agree their is some creaminess after the dram is over.

**Score:** 8

I absolutely loved the story to it, the bottle and the taste was amazing particulary considering the maturity. 

**Video** 

The video shows the unboxing process and my tasting, not in as much detail at all but worth a watch I reckon!

10 Smoothest American Single Malt Whiskeys Reviewed (2023),"I'm personally loving the attention ASM is getting, but the #2 comes in at north of $200. It's 11 years, but I certainly still haven't tasted an American single malt that's worthy of that number. Who's had... any of these?  [Link To Article](https://uproxx.com/life/smooth-american-single-malt-whiskeys-reviewed-fall-2023/)","It looks heavily sponsored. Like where is stranahans for example?. Or new keepers heart 10?  Sounds like not only taste went into this ranking but some cash
I've had Brother Justus, and don't care for it.  In the area, I much prefer the Dampfwerk american single malt.
The left out Stranahans which is the best of this style IMO.
Well, Keepers Heart is Irish whiskey. So that‚Äôs one reason. But it looks like Stranahan‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt a part of this one. Which it seems like they‚Äôre a part of everything asm, usually.
Not having any Stranahans OR Westland seems like a crime, both are excellent with good distrobution.
There are other brands but yeah. U know I ve never seen say anything good about wolves brand lol.
Keepers heart has different bottles, some are mixes but not all if I remember right.  I'm in Minneapolis, and the distillery is beautiful, so I have hopes for their long term future.
Hailing from CO, and seeing Boulder Spirits beat out Stanahans seems odd.
The didn‚Äôt even review Stranahans which IMO is the best in this category (especially a single barrel one)."
Yamazaki New Release,"Suntory just released a new NAS Yamazaki on 09/26, featuring a soft smoked Yamazaki at about $180. The Fukuoka duty free sold out in 3 hours. No news about this yet so I thought I would share this here.","Yes please
damn this looks interesting
I mean Octomore is a similar price and no age statement and is IMO the best whiskey ever made‚Ä¶ not sure I can pass up at least trying it if I see a bottle.
Can't wait to not find this bottle at MSRP!
Overpriced for a NAS, 43% ABV whiskey sadly
Trying to hard. Thats a no for me.

May the odds forever be in your favor though
smoky? that‚Äôs a nope for me dog.
Did you try it ?
Could you share the tasting notes for the Hakushu? Really love Hakushu's!
Wow! Can you please tell me where I can find these in the UK?
Just got back from Japan and was able to pick this up at Narita. People were rushing to get it and I managed to get the last bottle.
yeah I'd love to try that, but could probably only be pried to pay as much as $100, but probably only because I first discovered and loved the 12 when Costco was selling it for $35.
I‚Äôll be buying an Octomore per annual release if I can find it. There‚Äôs a limit to what I‚Äôd pay but $200 USD is still under it
Octomore is fantastic
costco will have it,  suntory loves costco

**Hakushu Bittersweet Edition**

A blend of malts produced in the Hakushu Distillery that have been aged exclusively in Spanish oak casks.
Along with the sweet and subtly bitter flavor, enjoy the refreshingly soft palate for which Hakushu is famous. The limited-edition design expresses the harvest season with the motif of tree leaves found in the Hakushu forest.

**COLOR**: Amber with reddish hues

**NOSE**: Cloves, apricot, prune

**PALATE**: A sweetly complex but sprightly flavor with notes of Manuka honey, orange marmalade, and cacao

**FINISH**: A well-balanced espresso-like bitter flavor that lingers pleasantly.
Seems like a full-sherry hakushu. Sounds delicious.
Get a plane ticket to Japan, and pray that you‚Äôll be lucky enough.
Unfortunately, I almost never see it anymore.  When I lived in a different state a local shop owner loved the stuff (and introduced me to it) and use to carry multiple variants.  He sold the store and the new owners don‚Äôt carry as much scotch and don‚Äôt have it anymore (still occasionally visit the store when on work trips).  I have run into a random bottle here and there (like in DC but it was usually a variant at big $$$ vs just a X.1 - which I think is the best).  The State controlled ABC store where I am now claims to get a little of it but I have never seen it get stocked anywhere.
Hopefully
I am already aware, I'm saying that these are two factors that automatically make me dislike the bottle from the start, plus with the almost $180 price tag doesn't even make it seem close to being worth it. To compare, an Oban 18 is $180.

Benriach 12 Peated is 46% ABV and is $60 at most liquor stores, just get that instead. Much tastier too, I guarantee it
I am a fan, bet it‚Äôs good !
Some places price gauge pretty bad too. Total wine had 13.1 for $300
Yeah, I usually love the soft peat in Springbank so I am mad curious about this
I just polished off a yam 18 good stuff"
Selection for party,"Throwing a surprise 40th. The venue has a little bar outside and they said I could do some sort of whiskey tasting. I don‚Äôt know how to go about this bc it‚Äôs just going to be something to do at they party. Not everyone drinks whiskey, so I kinda want a vibe of come check it out but not the main event of the party. Should I just have tasting notes on a paper and people come up and read it and pour their own samples? Or have a bartender there that pours them? And which 3 whiskeys would you recommend? Has anyone been to a tasting at a bday party? Anything in particular they did about the whiskey tasting that stands out to you?","I would not let people pour their own unless you're fine with burning through a ton of whiskey/potentially wasting a fair bit.
Would be very surprised if you can have an unmanned alcohol station at a venue but I agree with another commentator that it's best to not let your guests pour their own. Having a paper stand describing the whiskeys and tasting notes would be a nice touch, however.

In terms of selections, there's lots of different ways you can go about this depending on the budget, number of guests, and their experience with drinks. For example:

Low-budget, bourbon-ish, gives guests a tour of the basic flavor profiles  
\* Makers Mark 46 (wheated bourbon)  
\* Jack Daniel's Single Barrel (not Barrel Proof) or Woodford Reserve Double Oaked  
Most people's memory of Jack Daniel's is to shoot it or as a Jack and Coke for their basic product No.07, so this one could be an eye-opener for guests.  
\* Rittenhouse Rye (rye whiskey)

Low-budget, whiskey around the world  
\* Jameson Black Barrel (Irish Whiskey)  
\* Glenlivet 12 (Scotch)  
\* Old Forester 86 (Bourbon)

Higher-budget, whiskey around the world  
\* Macallan 12 year Double Cask (Scotch) or Redbreast 12 year (Irish)  
\* Hibiki Harmony (Japanese Whiskey)  
\* Knob Creek 12 year (Bourbon)

Finished whiskey for something a little different  
\* Angel's Envy (Port wine finished Bourbon)  
\* GlenDronach 12 year / GlenAllachie 12 year / Glenfiddich 12 year Sherry Cask / Aberlour 12 year (Sherry finished Scotches)  
\* Any rum or tequila finished whiskey - Gets to be hard to recommend something since I can't think of one that is available on shelves nationwide.

Edit: For some additions
I peeped your profile to see if you have more info on the event. Not seeing the comment you made anymore but based on what I saw I would say try to cater the whiskey selection based on the honoree's tastes. This is to celebrate them and hopefully provides a talking point in the evening.

Unfortunately their tastes veer towards very popular, allocated bourbons, which means it's not readily available on store shelves. So let's say you want to provide the next step up, it will be virtually impossible to find unless you get extremely lucky. Also, any alternatives to their current favorites are likely to be in the 60-100 range, even though their favorites are in the MSRP of 40-60.

That being said, I would provide the following suggestions for the whiskey tasting based on (1) their favorites are bourbons and (2) one of their favorites is a wheated bourbon (the other is hard to find a comparable):

* Doc Swinson's Alter Ego Triple Cask Bourbon Whiskey, for something sweet
* Markers Mark, any of their Barrel Select (about 80 üíµ), have fun with this one and pick one that sounds good
* Old Elk Master's Blend Double Wheat Straight Whiskey

These can be found in Total Wine in Culver City.

Let me know if you want me to take this down, as I am not sure why your comment was deleted.
Good point. Any 3 whiskey Recs ?
This is very helpful! Thank you! 

The venue manager is actually the one who recommended they do their own pours but I‚Äôm worried about someone dropping the bottle or something. So I think I‚Äôll stick w an extra bartender for this specifically. 

Normally this crowd drinks Hendricks and Jameson so I was thinking of making those basic cocktail options on the menu, so I don‚Äôt want to include those in the tastings.

I know the person being celebrated likes Eagle rare and Wellers(I‚Äôm not sure where these rank at?) Are those pretty popular? Do you think I should even consider them if the celebrated person already likes them? I imagine this person will be mingling around, it‚Äôs a party of 50. Maybe I should just provide ones that aren‚Äôt ‚Äúwidely known‚Äù. As you can tell I don‚Äôt know how to approach this. If it helps, the food being served will be paella. Maybe there‚Äôs one that would pair well with that.. ?

Do you think I could get away w this in clear plastic cups, or should I get glass ones for everyone? Although, that sounds expensive lol
Here‚Äôs the latest!
The venue just provided me with their whiskey bourbon list. Of course I don‚Äôt see any you mentioned, is there anything good in this list you recommend as alternatives? Or should I just buy the bottles myself and have them figure it out? Here‚Äôs the list:

Nahh I don't know enough to give specific recs. You could go a couple different directions though. Something like a bourbon/rye/scotch. Or you could do different brands/ages of the same type.

Kinda depends on what you want people to get out of it.
Yes, ER and any Weller (there are multiple products under this brand) are extremely popular, but I doubt you'll be able to find them on the shelves, even if you wanted it at the party. I don't recommend doing so anyway because that's what they've already had. A whiskey/bourbon drinker should be open to trying other bottles within the same flavor profile, i.e. ""I know you like Eagle Rare so I picked this bottle because it's finished in sweet sherry casks and these wheated bourbons can deliver the same softness as Weller. Try them out!""

In terms of food pairings, I'm unfortunately not that knowledgeable, but I've read BBQ, meats like steaks, nuts, and some fruits go well with bourbon. I think paella will be fine as long as it has strong, robust flavors like squid ink. I wouldn't do bourbon and grilled fish, for example. 

Glass is preferable over plastic cups since your dress code is not casual. Have you thought about champagne glasses at Dollar Tree or a small tumbler at Ikea? You can get something like these two:
 https://www.dollartree.com/tapered-champagne-flutes-625oz/189954

https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/reko-glass-clear-glass-80094014/

Whiskey tasting is typically done in 1 to 2 oz serving sizes as you are meant to sip the whiskey and not shoot it. This is a very small pour so that means you don't need a big glass. Guests can always go back for more or try the other bourbons.

If your budget is stretched thin, then maybe try this plastic glass, although I'm not sure how big it is:
https://www.dollartree.com/clear-plastic-water-glasses-5ct-packs/931492. Just don't do clear cups, that just reminds me of house parties in my 20s lol.

Hope this helps

Edit: spelling
You‚Äôre the best! Thank you!! 

So overall,  which 3 do you recommend I get? My budged is between $50 - $100 each. Although, cheaper the better obviously lol!
You're welcome. I like planning, as you can see.

In another comment I recommended the following, which can be found at Total Wine in Culver City:

>Doc Swinson's Alter Ego Triple Cask Bourbon Whiskey, for something sweet  
>  
>Markers Mark, any of their Barrel Select (about 80 üíµ), have fun with this one and pick one that sounds good  
>  
>Old Elk Master's Blend Double Wheat Straight Whiskey

These fit into your budget as they are $65, $77, and $93. There's one thing you should be aware of, however, in terms of logistics. A standard bottle is 750ml, which converts to 26.3oz. A whiskey flight size can vary but traditionally will be 0.5 - 1 oz pour per whiskey. I would recommend to instruct your bartender to do 0.5 oz pours but I would consider a bottle to give 37 servings if done by hand. I am undercounting the 52 servings (26.3 oz bottle \* 0.5 oz pour) because you would have to be very precise with the pouring. A 0.5 oz pour will look very similar to a 0.7 oz pour.

Ask if the bartender has a 0.5 oz jigger to measure out the tasting, otherwise you may run the risk of not having enough for all guests. This may not be a problem if not all guests will participate in the tasting.

If you think you need to provide more whiskey and the bartender doesn't have a jigger, then a different selection is needed that will allow you to buy two bottles for the three whiskeys. Or if you just want to spend less, you can try this selection but note that it gets harder to choose something diverse but also considered good:

* Maker's Mark (not 46), for something similar-ish to Weller. $20
* Angel's Envy - finished in port wine bottles, I get nutty/earthiness from this one. $37
* Glenfiddich 12 Sherry Cask Finish Scotch - for the sherry experience. $46
Idk why when I hear markers mark I always think of it as a basic brand, I‚Äôm probably totally wrong on this but maybe it‚Äôs because the barrel select is higher end.. I also have no idea which would sounds good bc I‚Äôm not a whiskey fan! I don‚Äôt think everyone will participate in the tasting. There‚Äôs also an open bar so if the bottles run out they can get something else. This party is definitely turning out to be a whole lot more work than I anticipated haha! I was thinking for the whiskey I should make like ‚Äúplacemats‚Äù with where the 3 glasses would good w a description of the whiskey on it. It‚Äôs not a whiskey bar so I don‚Äôt have high expectations that they will be able to elaborate on it. 

I found these glasses on Amazon today. Thoughts?


Good idea on the jigger! Maybe I need to get smaller glasses‚Ä¶

You wouldn't be wrong in that assessment. Regular Marker's Mark is good and basic but if the whiskey budget is $300 total and you had to buy multiple bottles of three whiskeys, some corners would need to be cut. It sounds like you can make do with one bottle each of the three whiskeys though.

Maker's Mark Barrel / Private Selects are considered higher end because they are limited editions of a flavor profile, amongst other things like being higher in alcohol level. They have playful names like Fireside Spice, Honeysuckle Breeze, and Bread Pudding. I would just pick one that sounds good to you.

Placemats are good, assuming it's a sit-down venue with tables and chairs (this is where I usually see them used). Otherwise there may be a bottleneck at the station if it's standing room because you're not really meant to shoot the whiskey in 5 minutes and go. For example a beer and wine stations just has to pour a glass or grab a bottle to keep the line moving.

For standing room, maybe have table or chalkboard signs to allow guests to see what is available with their description and tasting notes. This will allow the bartender to pour one whiskey of choice and guests can come back to try a different whiskey when they're done. Also those who are whiskey curious but end up not liking whiskey can bail out without having all three poured.

Those shot glasses will work well.
Any recommendations on some little snacks to have at the set up? Like peanuts or something? Or orange slices? Cheese? Chocolate? Just something that pairs with it. 

There‚Äôs a little bar outside where it will be set up at. There‚Äôs 3 stools that I will prob remove and have it more so standing that way people don‚Äôt camp out at the tasting. The rest of the patio and inside the venue has booth seating around the entire perimeter. There‚Äôs no formal tables or anything. 

I was thinking of just displaying the 3 bottles on the counter in the center of the bar and then have the glasses lined up in 3 at a time, I guess that‚Äôs why I was thinking little menus, but it will prob be a waste anyway. I guess I can goose the taste notes and just print it out and put frames next to each one and the bartender can just pour it. But I do feel like I need a board of what should be paired with it. Thoughts on this?
Some common snack pairings are:

* Dark chocolate, like 75%+ cacao content
* Peanuts
* Trader Joe‚Äôs dark chocolate peanut butter cups (combines the two above!)
* Smoked almonds
* Pretzels
* Charcuterie meats and cheeses like sharp cheddar

I don't know specifically which snack pairs with which whiskey. That gets into more sommelier levels for me lol.

Yeah signs next to each bottle should work out.

One more thing, I recommend ordering the whiskeys by their ABV/Proof levels. You want to start off at the lowest alcohol level first and work your way up. If you did the reverse and start off high proof, you may wear out your taste buds and lower proof whiskeys will taste watered down or have less flavor. You can get bottle descriptions and tasting notes from the website or on the bottle itself."
"Hudson Whiskey Five Year, BevMo Barrel Select (BB-803)","Solid whiskey for the Price (~45 or less), nose is strong of Vanilla and Oak (surprising amounts of oak for a five year old whiskey). Tasting, the oak overpowered the vanilla notes of the nose, and while it‚Äôs not harsh it‚Äôs definitely not the smoothest whiskey I have had. Not sure what the mash bill is, but I feel like I taste corn in addition to the malts. Sweet finish with lingering oak, that stays around on the palate. On my second pour of the evening after a long day of work. I get the feeling this would make a solid old fashioned with some Orange bitters, with a reduced amount of simple syrup compared to my usual recipe. Maybe even a whiskey sour, though I generally prefer rye for that style of drink.",
Just a small and short comparison of two similar bourbons,"I recently reviewed my Booker's 2023-02 and I really enjoy it. I just got done making a batch of aged egg nog with the KC SiB Reserve and had a couple ounces left over. Since these are from the same distillery and close in proof, I figured it would be worth a short comparison.

Tasting notes are largely the same with the Jim Beam profile shining through on both expressions. 

However, the Booker's is quite a bit more complex. The Single Barrel pales in comparison. Personally, I wasn't surprised by this. Booker's is a batched product made with ""honey barrels"" and the KC is a single barrel product. 

Both are great if you love the Beam profile but this shows that Booker's is really earning its premium. 

Cheers y'all!","I love both but Booker's is on another level. Always worth buying in my book
Agreed"
WHISKY HUNTING IN JAPAN (My experience and advice),"I would like to preface this with a bit of context. I recently went to Japan for a couple weeks and remained on Honshu travelling between Tokyo and Hiroshima. The reason I am making this post is because of the lack of material on this subject online. Whilst it is there, you really have to dig deep and piece things together yourself. Given the selection of whiskey available in Japan this is criminal and I want to rectify this. This post is not the be all and end all of how to get the rarest whiskey in Japan but simply my experience and what I learnt. I am primarily a bourbon drinker so that was mainly what I was looking for however I was on the lookout for some Japanese Whisky.

ALL I ASK: if you have recently been to Japan or live there, please share some advice as well as your pickups!

**AVAILIBILITY**

If you guys are anything like me (which is a safe assumption), you are looking for something you can‚Äôt find at home. Being from the UK, we have a great selection of Scotch and Japanese whiskey but the selection of bourbon is lacklustre to put it lightly. In Japan you will find a fantastic selection of both Scotch and Bourbon but Japanese whiskey is a lot harder.

I‚Äôll start with Scotch because this is easy. Simply put, great scotch at great prices, they even get their own exclusives bottlings. Some bottles are even cheaper there than they are here in the UK! Historically, Japan loves scotch, and a lot of their own whiskey reflects this.

Bourbon. Now there are the Japanese exclusives like 4R Platinum, WT 13, WT 12, Evan Williams 12 year etc. Some are more available than others. Don‚Äôt expect to see Blantons Takara Gold on every shelf. I have seen so many people say they are readily available but the truth is, it does take a little bit of searching. Please Please Please be careful, because some shops (smaller ones are the biggest offenders but some large chains will do it too) will mark up things like Blantons black to extortionate prices likes 12k Yen I once saw. Do your research on the particular bottle you are looking for and make sure you are paying the correct price for it. Worst case, spend a couple minutes inside the shop looking it up on your phone. Going to the bigger chains gives you a better chance at bagging these bottles at a normal price. Generally, do not assume just because you saw a bottle once it will be at the next shop. I found there was a lot of variation in stock, even in shops on the same street. I saw WT 12 twice and I pulled the trigger in the first shop. Outside of the exclusives, there is a decent amount of bourbon out there. Coming from the UK, so many of them you can‚Äôt get here however this may be different for other countries.

I was disappointed to say the least when it came to Japanese Whisky. Other than the standard ones like Suntory AO, Nikka Tailored (cool box lol), Nikka single malts Yoichi and Miyagiko, Nikka black, Akashi black, white and red, Mars Cosmo etc‚Ä¶ In Tokyo I did not even see a single bottle of Yamazaki, Hakushu or Hibiki. When I did see them after having travelled west, the prices were preposterous. I saw Yama 18 for no less than 130k Yen, Hibiki 21 for no less than 100K Yen etc. Personally, I think even at RRP there aren‚Äôt many compelling reasons to buy them, however, if you do really like these bottles, I‚Äôm sorry, you just will not be able to find them at a reasonable price unless you get incredibly lucky. To put it in context, I wanted to come back with more Japanese whiskey than anything else, I came back with 4 bottles of bourbon and 1 bottle of Japanese whisky and that was from the airport as I was leaving‚Ä¶

**WHERE HAS THE BEST SELECTION?**

I personally observed that the further west I went, the better the Japanese whiskey selection got. I saw Suntory in abundance when visiting Hiroshima. Bourbon and Scotch were pretty much the same however I will say that I went through more trouble finding stuff in Tokyo vs the west again.

All this being said, I was only there a couple weeks and I think it ultimately depends on when you go. I‚Äôve heard as many people say they found crazy stuff in Tokyo as they did in other places.

At the end of the day, no matter where you are, you will find something for you, that I can pretty much guarantee.

**MY PERSONAL PICKUPS**

Bakers 7 ‚Äì 6,165 yen ‚Äì Liquor Mountain Sankyo Umeda Building

Wild Turkey 12 ‚Äì 6,600 Yen ‚Äì Liquor Mountain 777 Ginza (Tax free)

Wild turkey Revival ‚Äì 22,000 Yen - ÂÖÉÁî∫WHISKY

Hibiki Masters Select ‚Äì 12,000 Yen ‚Äì Haneda Duty free (Tax free)

Wild Turkey Rare Breed Non Chill Filtered - ¬£46.59 ‚Äì Heathrow Duty free (Tax free)

Daishichi Shuzo Minowamon Junmai Daiginjo Sake - 4500 Yen -  Asano Sake Shop. Only reason I mention this one is because the Lady that helped me here was so helpful. This was a present and I was walking her through his preference in flavours and we tried 5 or 6 different bottles together before I chose this one. Super friendly and if you are looking for Sake in Umeda, go there.

**TASTINGS**

Some shops will offer the opportunity to taste some of the bottles at reasonable prices.

However, if you are wanting to try the rare Japanese whiskies there are 2 places I highly recommend.

The Suntory Whisky House in Osaka. I personally had a flight of Hibiki 21, Yamazaki 18 and Hakushu 18 for approx ¬£30. If you are lucky, they will have even older age stated bottles. There are other Suntory/Beam products for sale as well.

The Suntory Bar Mint. No affiliation to Suntory. A small 4 seater bar located on the 3rd floor of a building in Hiroshima. The selection of Japanese Whisky as well as scotch is brilliant and the prices are reasonable. I had a pour of Yama 2021 LE, Spanish Oak and Bordeaux Cask. The Mrs went for two pours of the Hibiki Blossom 2021 and one of the 17 year old. This in total cost 13,200 yen. I appreciate when I say the price is reasonable this is still quite a bit of money in the grand scheme of things, however is was a once in a life time type of tasting I doubt I will ever find these at a reasonable price in the UK. The owner runs the place with his mum and this is the third generation running it. They are such lovely people and he is very knowledgeable about what hes got at the bar. His English is good but does occasionally struggle but that‚Äôs nothing google translate can‚Äôt fix. If you are in Hiroshima, you have to go there, even if its only for one drink.

Prices are not advertised normally in bars so best course of action is to walk into places and ask. Don‚Äôt feel bad to walk away if the prices are too much.

**AIRPORTS**

Do NOT rely on the duty free on your way back. I got lucky with the Hibiki as it is normally sold out. They normally have everything basic you can find on the streets in Japan but at a slightly higher price. Some travel exclusives, but again, don‚Äôt go in expecting to find everything you didn‚Äôt when you were hunting. I do wish I had space for the Roku cherry blossom tho :(

**SHOPS**

Now there are quite a few liquor stores in Japan. The ones that are absolutely worth a visit are Shinnanoya, Bottle off, Yamaya and Liquor Mountain. I spent most of my time visiting those and they are where I got most of my bottles, however people have mentioned that BIC camera world can have good stuff if you are lucky.

In Kobe there is a place called ‚ÄúÂÖÉÁî∫WHISKY‚Äù and that place deserves a shout out because the selection there was just fantastic, I got a bottle of Masters Keep Revival there for 22kYen. They did have things like black Blantons, other Masters keeps (the cornerstone and the 17 yo one), great scotch from young to 25+ years etc. (They are NOT tax free)

In some shops they allow you to taste bottles and it ranges from 100 yen to 1000+ depending on the bottle. It would be a crime to not take advantage of this! There is no obligation to buy either so have as many as you like. I tried the 4R premium that way and decided it was not worth bringing back. I also managed to try some bottles that I‚Äôve always wanted to. Tried the Balvenie 15 Madeira cask for 900yen and that was so good! These are not full pours, normally 10-15ml however the prices are so low that it is actually worth it imo. I did tastings at Liquor Mountain 777 Ginza as well as Liquors Hasegawa.

**DELIVERY**

u/bluechapeau made a great point in the comments section that you can get alcohol delivered to you (for a modest fee)! So, if you don't have the time to be whiskey hunting and are staying in the same place for a few days then this can be perfect for you. Amazon is the obvious candidate here, however there are other providers such as Yahoo Japan.

A few warnings however. Delivery addresses are written differently in Japan, so make sure to input it all correctly. Check with your hotel that you can do this, they will most likely say yes however it's polite and they can also potentially help you with things like inputting the address. I have personally not used this method, however, I think we have all used Amazon in our respective countries so I believe this should be an easy and safe way of getting your whiskey.

**USING GOOGLE MAPS**

To really make the most of your time, type this into google maps: ÈÖíÂ±ã

This will show all the liquor shops close to you. This is fantastic, but it can be a gamble for various reasons. The opening times are sometimes wrong, and to make it worse theres no standard time. I‚Äôve been to shops that open at 10am and others at 6pm. Sometimes the shop is actually permanently closed but no one updated it and other times theres not even a shop there. Sometimes the shops will only have sake and beer.

Best thing you can do is just look at the reviews and images and judge it from that.

**TAX FREE**

it is a little odd the way it works but the short version is, it has to be done on the day you buy your item and the shop itself must offer it. You just need your passport and they will do the rest for you. You cannot claim tax on stuff at the airport when you are leaving. They also normally say it‚Äôs on purchases above 5,500 yen but some shops require more, they did not give me tax free on the bakers in Liquor Mountain Umeda but they did for the WT 12 at the liquor mountain in Ginza. Tax there is 10%, so tbh, it‚Äôs not a major loss if you don‚Äôt get it but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to ask even if you don‚Äôt see the tax free sticker.

**HOW MUCH CAN YOU BRING BACK AND HOW?**

This depends on your country. UK allows 4L of spirits per person but it must be transported by yourself so you can‚Äôt combine it if you are sharing a checked luggage for example.

I had a layover in Rome and their customs only allows 1L of spirits to be brought through. Thankfully the checked luggage didn‚Äôt need picking up but I was unable to get a bottle of Roku Cherry Blossom because I bought the Hibiki at Haneda.

Duty limits are a pain the butt, make sure you read up on them and stay within the limits. In the UK if you go over, you are required to pay taxes on ALL items in that category, e.g, you got 4L of whiskey then you buy a bottle at duty free taking you over the limit, you now have to pay tax on all the bottles not just that one that took you over.

**HOW TO TRANSPORT**

Packing the bottles is super important if you don't want a soggy suitcase full of broken glass. I went to Don Quijote and got a massive roll of bubble wrap and some tape. If you can open the box (i.e not in a duty free bag) I would take the bottle out, wrap it and flatten the box. This worked fine for me and saved a little bit on space. If you can't flatten the box just pack some bubble wrap inside with the bottle then protect the outside of the box with some more bubble wrap.

Taking a checked luggage is a good idea, we brought an empty 23kg suitcase and 2 carry on's (for clothes) on the way there. Let's just say they were all bulging on the way back...

**CONCLUSION**

Whiskey good.

Feel free to ask any questions and correct me if I‚Äôve made any mistake. If I think of anything else I will add it on.

I hope this helps.

Thank you for reading and good luck!

**EDITS:**

20/09/23 - Added ""HOW TO TRANSPORT"" + ""DELIVERY"" Section","Great write up, much appreciated. Did you happen to see any Rare Breed NCF in Tokyo stores or the airport duty free when you departed Japan?
Thanks mate!

Edit: I talked to you OP in your initial post of what you get and commented here before even reading anything.

Now I did it and really thankful for your input. I will go to Tokyo in December for the 1st time (layover 22 yrs ago and wish I was into whiskey back then. I talked to a cousin who bought a Yama 18 for $100 back in 2000 in Hawai'i). Well, we can all beat ourselves up had we know whiskeys inflation would be like this beforehand. 

Anyways, Cheers and enjoy as many whiskey as you can!!!
Very good writeup! I've lived here for two years and the whiskey hunting experience is changing. Even the popular bourbon bars are noticing the rapidly increasing prices, and rapidly declining supply, for what used to be readily available bourbon. Blanton's is the craziest markup, like you said, and when the big chains like YAMAYA get it, it sells out in a day. 

I quit hunting Japanese whisky here ages ago. It's just not worth it and most stores are making it impossible to buy unless you're Japanese (must have a store card, most of which require a Japanese bank account). At bars, however, it's relatively easy to find for reasonable prices.

Like America, the good bourbon is now hidden behind curtains and counters. You have to ask for it...and they have to decide to say yes and show it to you. Dusty bourbon is only found on auction sites (at about double the price of last year) or in far flung corners of Japan that aren't accessible by train.

FWIW, you paid a markup on Revival, which was 18k yen for months. Markup is worth it if you want it, though.
Thanks for a fantastic writeup!

I am curious, did you notice if the selection & pricing was good, either in local shops in Japan or in airports, of whiskies from other East Asian and Pacific countries, for example Taiwainese and Australian single malt whiskies?
Phenomenal write up thank you for the insight

Great write up! I‚Äôve made a number of trips to Tokyo for work over the past year. I agree with everything in this post and have a couple of adds. If you will be in one spot for a couple of days, especially in large cities, you can get overnight delivery of liquor to your hotel via Yahoo Japan or Amazon.  Prices are essentially the same as in stores, with a modest shipping fee added. Regarding whiskey, it‚Äôs essentially Japanese, Scottish, and American origin. I didn‚Äôt see any significant offerings from other countries.

Lastly, I‚Äôll foot stomp the observation on finding Japanese whiskey in Japan.  My observation, confirmed with my colleague in Japan, is that aged Japanese whiskey can be more readily found at a lower price in the US than in Japan.
Very awesome writeup, I was worried it was another lost soul hoping to buy japanese whisky in japan (rather than bourbon)
[deleted]
Fantastic write up! I was in Japan a few months ago and had the exact same experience. I did see blantons more than you did I think, and it wasn‚Äôt terribly expensive (for the regular stuff).  Thanks for taking the time to write this all down!
This subject crops up from time to time from people (well, like me) who are headed to Japan and want to know where they can score some of the Japan-only exclusive bottles. Any information over a year old or so should be considered dated at best and the older it is, the more unreliable it's likely to be.  
  
That said, I spent 10 days in Japan last month. I researched heavily before I went and the trip went exceptionally well. If you don't do your homework, or you don't put in some real effort when you're there, you could easily come home with some very basic stuff and not any of the bottles you were hoping for.  
  
2023 Japan isn't 2013 Japan. Americans (and Japanese) have made things much different today than even a few years ago. The larger cities are routinely picked clean just like they are here. Prices in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka are at least 30-50% higher than they are in less-traveled areas. If you're landing in Tokyo or Osaka and think you'll stroll through duty-free and grab all those Wild Turkey and Blanton's you've heard about you are going to get sadly disappointed.  
  
So...what to do? Ginza, Shibuya, and Shinjuku in Tokyo are routinely scoured by Americans looking for the same stuff you are. Same thing in Gion in Kyoto, You may find a Takara Red Blanton's or a regular Blanton's Gold at Bic Camera, Liquor Mountain, Shinanoya, or Yamaya but it's haphazard at best. You will see tons of Eagle Rare and Buffalo Trace but for God's sake don't fly to Asia to bring those back. Wild Turkey 8-year is everywhere. For all practical purposes, Wild Turkey 12 won't exist in any of the big cities. Someone will have it snatched up long before you ever get there. Same with Evan Williams 12. I never saw either in Tokyo, Kyoto, or Osaka. Old Ezra is available there though. You can try and go out to Rappongi and see what is available (I didn't) but I suspect it would be similar.  
  
If you want the big hitters, you'll have to go where Americans aren't. I did find EW12 in Hiroshima and WT 12 in Nara. The farther you get from Americans, the better luck you'll probably have. This takes time and effort. To be effective, you'll need a car. Trains can get you close but you'll burn a lot of time walking and on a vacation trip you don't have forever. Store hours can be weird there too.  
  
What I did was use the kanji for liquor store in Japanese in Google Maps. Search for ÈÖíÂ±ã. Hit the bricks and see what you can find. It also helps immensely to learn some basic Japanese, especially when roaming outside of the cities. The Japanese are incredibly helpful and friendly and will respect the hell out of you for trying in Japanese. If you walk in a store and ask ""Burantons bahbon wa arimasu ka?"" you'll be tatering Japanese style. (That's ""Do you have any Blanton's?"")  
  
I came back with two WTMK 17-Year BiB that were 97 each. A WTMK One was also 97. WT 12 was 40. EW 12 was 28. Blanton's Takara Black was 34. Blanton's Takara Red was 61 and Takara Gold was 122. Old Ezra 12 was 35. These are not tourist area prices but should give you an idea of what real retail prices are there. Eagle Rare and BT (again, just don't) were 29 and 16 respectively.  
  
As far as transport, I took over 25 of the inflatable wine bags I bought from Amazon. The boxed items I just wrapped in clothes. Everything came back with no issues. I do take the extra step of using zip ties on Blanton's bottles because I've had a SFTB leak coming back from Germany.  At customs at O'Hare in Chicago, they seemed not to care in the least what we had. I have Global Entry and just scanned in and left. The two I was with didn't even have to fill out a declaration form. One was asked what he purchased and he said liquor and they didn't care. You can carry 5 liters per TSA but only 1 liter is considered duty-free. Taxes, even if they actually cared, are insignificant. Don't sweat that at all. Be prepared, but there are so many people processing through they aren't going to mess with you.  


Total haul with my two ""mules"" was 19 bottles.
Epic write up mate, using this right now as I venture throughout Osaka/Kyoto. 

Just wanted to touch base re Suntory in Hiroshima. Did you see any aged Yamazaki/Hibiki in abundance or other Suntory drops? Will be visiting there shortly so keen to know if I should pounce on a few here or wait it out.

Thanks.
Found WT12 at the same spot as OP, there's at least a bottle left! Also I realized the higher end vintages of Japanese whiskies are cheaper in the US, but the low end ones can be found at decent prices.
You might have better luck picking it up in a US airport when you're leaving for Japan. I saw it at the last 2 airports I've been to (Miami and SeaTac).
Thank you! No I did not unfortunately. For that one, given it's a travel exclusive, you will just have to hope the airport has it. 9 times out of 10 when you find travel exclusives outside duty free, it'll cost an arm and a leg.
You are very welcome and you are pretty much certain to snag something special out there if you do a little bit of looking around! At the end of the day, there will always be something that you somehow missed out on, but that makes finding a specific bottle that much more special.

Enjoy your trip! Outside of whiskey, it truly is a unique place full of a ton of weird and wonderful things. I don't think I had a single bad meal out there. 

I'd love to you what you end up finding so please keep us all updated, Cheers!
Thank you so much! I saw a bottle of regular Blanton's gold for 50k Yen... I was speechless. It is unfortunate that bars are putting the prices up because especially given the selection they have you can try so many you have never seen before as well as make a decision as to whether to buy a whole bottle of something or not.

Yes, I 100% agree with this. What I find particularly hilarious is, I've yet to try a Japenese whiskey that doesn't drink like a scotch. With the scotch offerings they have, you can very easily get a bottle that is superior to the ""rare"" Japanese whiskies for a fraction of the price.

That is very much the unfortunate reality of today. England is sort of the same but where we lack is we just don't have ""Liquor Stores"". We have off licenses but those normally don't offer anything special and they are marked up to hell. Unless you live in the big cities, you don't really have actually shops that specialise in spirits. Then again, even those shops mark up like crazy. Our best bet here is online purchases. 

Have you been to those ""far flung"" corners you've mentioned? I'm curious because theres a lot of conflict I see online of people saying you really have to travel off the beaten path vs people saying thats a load of shit. If you have, is it really that much better and worth it?

I had no idea that was the price, however in this instance, I'm actually not too mad. Here in the UK you really can't find it (if you do its ¬£400+) and from the research I did, the MSRP was $150 so I thought that was the price to pay for it, didn't realise the Japanese MSRP was lower! I am also a sucker for a sherry finished scotch and have never tried a sherry finished bourbon so I thought the combo was particularly interesting.
Thank you so much! 

That‚Äôs an interesting question, unfortunately I did not pay attention to these as I don‚Äôt really drink them. I will say I saw quite a few of the Amruts and the pricing seemed fine. I would suspect that asian sprits would be reasonably priced and even Australian given how well bourbon and scotch is priced
Thank you very much!

I did look at delivery options but didn't do it in the end, I will add your comments to the post however, as this can save some time for other people. My better half would have probably been a lot happier if I did this vs dragging her into every shop I saw lol.

Same situation in the UK, however, thats only the case at auction. You would have to double the price to get it from a shop here. Either way though, imo, it's not worth the mark up.
Thank you! Ah no, I did my research and I sort of knew what I was getting into. Although I will admit, the situtation was a lot more dire than I expected.
Bloody hell, that is ridiculous. 

Is that 21k for the Takara Gold? Because if it is then thats a brilliant deal otherwise for regular gold its a meh price. Tbf in Japan I only ever saw it once so it may be worth the price if you like it.
Thank you so much! Yeah I did not see Blanton‚Äôs often however you are absolutely correct that the pricing, for the most part, is reasonable and compared to the UK its cheaper. I did not buy any because I knew it wouldn‚Äôt meet my expections and I‚Äôd rather get bottles that are more interesting, given my limited duty limit. That being said, if i ever went back I‚Äôd try and pick up a bottle I think.

No problem at all, glad you liked it. The lack of info online really pushed me to write it so I hope this helps people in the future.
Brilliant Haul mate and fantastic planning! 

I agree everyone is looking in the same places however don‚Äôt discard them entirely! I found my WT12 in Ginza. It was, as you said, haphazard but still i would say visit all the big spots because you never know. On that point as well, i have been to smaller shops in the less touristy areas of the big cities, the selection there was worse than the big chains. 
So there is no general rule that one place has better stock than the other, it all depends on when you visit. 

Time is a major factor. I went with my other half and she tolerates my shit quite a bit but by the end of it even she would roll her eyes and sigh when we saw a liquor store and I asked if we could go in lol. A car is a good idea and will save you time however in the larger cities (which is most likely where you‚Äôll spend your time if you have never been before) it‚Äôs tough because parking is expensive and a nightmare and not to mention traffic conditions.

Yes I agree, not too long from now our comments will be outdated however the general advice will always remain the same. 

Regarding the duty free and bringing bottles back into your country, i would strongly advise people to follow the limits because if you are caught, the repercussions can be major. That being said, in the UK they were more interested in the cigarettes we brought in than the alcohol. Do what you feel comfortable with at the end of the day.

Thanks for your comment, hopefully it can help someone else too!
Where bar Suntory is there are a liquor stores (incl a liquor mountain) on the same strip and they had quite a few Yama and Hakushu 12s but nothing older. To be completely honest with you though, it‚Äôs really luck of the draw on what you‚Äôll get and when they do have the aged stuff they mark it up like crazy. 

Id say Bar Suntory is absolutely worth a visit to be able to try some rare pours. If you go see if they can remember a British couple drinking Hibiki and Yamazaki a few months ago!
Glad you got one, its an amazing bottle!! 

Yes you are absolutely right about the Japanese whiskies, Akashis were available fore under ¬£10, Nikka tailored for ¬£30 etc.. way cheaper than in the UK or US
Awesome many thx
I've seen it all, Blanton's 1992 in Ginza for 9000y, as well as weird older Wild Turkey offerings in rural liquor stores, and a Masters Keep 17 year for 10,000y in a grocery store. Japan has these companies popping up that seek dusty liquor bottles and I think during COVID they consolidated everything toward Tokyo. All of that is gone. Every weird, rural liquor store I've hunted since summer is barren. If you want to know what it was like during the pandemic, check out The Whiskey Shelf. He hunted a lot of stuff here. Sadly his experience is likely not replicable.
Don't know that can make you feel better , the Baker's 7 you bought is sold here in California around $60 USD. About ¬•8863 in the current exchange rate. You bought it for $41.73 USD. People will jump at it if you post it on Bourbon group.

Brilliant I'll keep that in mind, thank you my friend! Probably only looking for a Yama 12 or Hibiki Blossom/maybe just maybe a 21 (there is one for 850k at the Osaka Whisky Bank that I am very close to pulling the trigger on). Yama 12 around here is like 280k so hoping can see something a bit shy of that.

I was lucky enough to visit the Yama distillery and tried a variety of different pours. Yama 18, Hakushu 18, Hibiki 21, Yama limited edition 2023 and the Yama 12 Spanish Oak, Puncheon and Mizunara casks. An excellent breakfast at 10am ü§å
Sorry to bug you again but do you recall if any of the shops in Hiroshima had Hibiki 21? About to pull the trigger here for ~¬•80k but could wait till Friday for Hiroshima lol
At NRT right now and picked up both the yamazaki smoky batch and hakushu forest edition, more bottles available. This trip I snagged the WT, and the aforementioned 2 at retail (18k yen each), and the 100th anniversary no-age and 12yr editions at about retail as well. Will see if I can find an aged edition at the airport before takeoff üòÄ
Damn that is nuts, looks like I visited Japan too late! oh well, I'll probably be back lol
The money I saved there paid for the the money I overpaid on the revival in that case lol. I've not seen it here in the UK before and many sites that did have it were selling it between ¬£70-¬£100. I didn't pick it up first but then got the chance to try it at the suntory whisky house in Osaka. I really liked it and thought why the hell not. This may be controversial, but, it was better then getting a blanton's black imo.
Damn yeah in that case definitely worth it. In the UK they are both a little cheaper than that but still nowhere near RRP.
What a haul, hope you find those aged ones too, would really be the cherry on top of the cake!"
Virginia Distillery Courage & Conviction Tasting,"I‚Äôm terrible at reviews. Here are my first impressions. Ratings out of 10. 

Sherry Cask - 6.0, the sherry cask removed some of the whiskey profile smells and flavor. It tastes better and smoother than other wine casks from other distilleries, but the balance is still off

Cuv√©e cask - 7.9, the cuv√©e cask enhances the whiskey flavor in a unique, smooth, and complex way. There‚Äôs both spice and sweetness on the palate and the finish feels more like an aged Highland scotch. I could drink this all day.

Bourbon cask - 6.4, typical whiskey profile with some heat. The butterscotch overpowered the other flavors and in not a good way. It‚Äôs fairly smooth, but uninspiring. 

Courage & Conviction Signature Malt - 7.7, way better than the bourbon cask. Intense flavor with long pleasant finish. 

Double cask - 7.5, Full-bodied flavor with moderate heat. Above average whiskey. 

I wish I could give more details but my palate isn‚Äôt refined enough to give detailed notes. I will likely pick up a bottle of the Cuv√©e Cask and maybe the Signature Malt. I‚Äôve been to their tasting room before and it‚Äôs gorgeous. Well worth the trip.",Their tasting room in the summer time used to be in their barrel barn. The air was 7% abv when I visited. Amazing place and glad to see them getting love for their efforts
Review #13: Jefferson Reserve Single Barrel,"Howdy again. How‚Äôs everyone? Good I hope. I have another bottle that I‚Äôm trying for the first time, and I‚Äôm honestly a little hesitant on it. I‚Äôve read a various array of mixed opinions on any Jefferson‚Äôs Reserve entry, so this doesn‚Äôt exactly inspire hope. I am, however, willing to throw that information to the wayside to give this a fair shot. I already own the fucking bottle anyways, so it‚Äôd be a little pointless not to. 

Here‚Äôs the description from their website. ‚ÄúTrey decided to offer Jefferson‚Äôs Reserve, our most quintessential bourbon in the portfolio, at a higher proof to satisfy the thirst of a bigger more robust Reserve offering. This expression enhances the flavors without being too strong. The single barrel allows the Jefferson‚Äôs Reserve flavors to be amplified at the enhanced proof. Jefferson‚Äôs Reserve at 100 proof hits the apex of flavors extracted, without burying the secondary elements.‚Äù I‚Äôve never tried any Jefferson‚Äôs Reserve products so this will be a first for me.

Distillery: Kentucky Artisan Distillery 

Type and Region: Bourbon, Kentucky, USA

Alcohol: 50% (100 proof)

Age: NAS, says very old but what‚Äôs their definition of that?

Composition: 60% corn, 30% rye, 10% malted barley 

Cask type: new, charred American oak 

Barrel: 517, bottle no. 131. Chosen by Trey Zoeller, if that makes it any better. I know he‚Äôs a founder. 

Nose: bourbon. caramel, some corn, very light. Cinnamon, spearmint, clove, and oak. After tasting I get a lot of peanut brittle (reminiscent of Beam), vanilla,  and dark cherries. Peanut shells. Burnt sugar.  Icing. It‚Äôs all a bit light on the nose for my liking. The majority of these scents aren‚Äôt bursting, they‚Äôre fainter. 

Taste: first taste is cinnamon, spearmint, honey, and oakiness. After, I get some roasted peanuts, white pepper, and caramel. Baker‚Äôs spices and herbal heat, the spice is nice for 100 proof. Cherries, cherry cola, and peanut shells. It reminds me a LOT of the Jim Beam Single Barrel I had a year ago. Finish is oaky with cinnamon, mint, and brown sugar. The mouthfeel is oily and quite good. This tastes a lot better than it smells to me. 

So this is a good bottle. Good, but not exceptional. The nose is a bit lacking, but the flavor makes up for that. I don‚Äôt necessarily think I would own another bottle based off of this, but this is also a neck pour. The majority of my reviews have been neck pours, so I am excited to see where this and the rest of my bottles open up to with some oxygenation. But, where it stands currently, there isn‚Äôt enough variation for me to warrant the $60 price point at MSRP. If the nose were a bit better to meld with the taste, I think my opinion would be a little different. 

Score: 84. Pretty solid pour, everyday drinker depending on value.

Grading Scale:  (courtesy of u/Letter10 thanks again)  
96-100: Outstanding pour, will buy another bottle asap. Perfect    
90-95: Damn good pour, I'm smitten    
85-89: A very good Pour, will definitely grab another when its empty    
80-84: Pretty solid pour, everyday drinker depending on value    
75-79: Eh, still drinkable but not in any hurry to get another    
70-74: Share it with friends who pretend to like whiskey    
65-69: Not worth the money in my opinion    
64 and below: probably not going to finish this stuff",
Less sweet bourbon?,"Hello everyone,

I still see myself as a beginner in the whisky world, but so far I really enjoyed scotch whisky (peated and non peated) and I'm a big fan of the lot 40.

I bought a bottle of buffalo trace 6 months ago wich I didn't really enjoyed at first. But I recently tried it again and I start to like it. I loved the spicy note from the rye and the warm feeling, but I just find it a little too sweet for my taste. 

I was wondering if there are less sweet bourbon? A friend told me to look for wild turkey and maker's mark. 

Since I'm Canadian I don't have access to every bourbon available, my budget is under 100$ per bottle. 

Thank you very much!","Old Grandad Bonded 100 proof. Higher rye content so it‚Äôs on the less sweet side. Should be around $50 cad.
Bourbon isn‚Äôt bourbon without corn. Corn tends to create sweeter whiskeys, so finding something with a higher percent of rye in its mash bill would be my first suggestion. Just finished a bottle of Starlight Distillery‚Äôs Huber‚Äôs Old Rickhouse Rye Whiskey which I thought was terrific, though I think it‚Äôs not technically a bourbon. Working on a bottle of Wyoming Whiskey Outryder which has a higher rye content without it being a true rye whiskey, but it‚Äôs not quite a bourbon either. If you‚Äôre sticking with just true bourbons, I really liked Four Roses Small Batch Select which I think has over 30% rye.
Makers mark has wheat in the mash bill and wheated whisky is almost always sweeter. Have you tried rye instead of bourbon?  Lots of nice spice notes there.
Based on what you currently enjoy see if you can pick up a bottle of Redwood Empire‚Äôs Lost Monarch. It‚Äôs a blend of Rye and Bourbon. I‚Äôd say it drinks a little more like a Rye than a bourbon, but still has some Bourbon notes if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for. 

I‚Äôm a big fan of rye whiskey. I tried a bottle of Lot 40, which was perfectly nice but a bit too polite - not enough rye heat. I think NYDC Ragtime Rye Bottled-in-Bond is an outstanding rye if you can get hold of if. Alternatively Redwood Empire Emerald Giant has a similar flavour profile.

If you aren‚Äôt a big fan of sweeter whiskey then probably avoid Rittenhouse Rye which has a high corn percentage. It‚Äôs got a buttery popcorn thing going on alongside the rye, I love it but I think it would be too sweet for you.
Look for High Rye Bourbons. Redemption High Rye and Old Grand-Dad Bonded will probably be the easiest to find. Bulleit and Wild Turkey 101 have medium high Rye. Maybe try a low Rye Rye Whiskey? Knob Creek, Rittenhouse, and Old Overholt Bonded I believe are all 51% Rye.
Legent is a nice one, and Woodford Double Oaked.
Maker's is very sweet to me (lots of maple syrup and caramels) so I wouldn't do that. Wild turkey and Russell's reserve are good recommendation as they are usually more cinnamon notes. I would recommend maybe a high rye bourbon or even a rye whiskey for less sweetness. Though I should note that the goal of most bourbons is to bring out the sweeter caramels. Older bourbons have much more oak presence you may like though they are harder to find
Rye
Since you‚Äôre Canadian, have you tried 40 Creek rye?  Everyone knows Crown Royal, but I find that sweet and the 40 Creek isn‚Äôt.  I know your question is about bourbon, but I stick to rye and can‚Äôt help you there.
Drink Rye. That was my Scotch to Bourbon gateway.
Woodford reserve or Elijah Craig small batch. Affordable and really nice balance of oak. Way less sweet then a lot of the other common bottles, but delicious
Is your mind set on Bourbon? American whiskey can be similar but have less corn and more rye or be aged in different barrels, including ex bourbon barrels.
I'll probably get some hate for this, but seeing as how alot of the comments here are recommending Rye...check out Jim Beam Rye. Great introduction to the style and won't break the bank. Should be readily available and, as far as I'm aware, haven't seen a pattern of people trying to price gouge for it.
Old Forester 1910 is fantastic. I can have it for around $55. It's a great finished bourbon that has a good amount of oak. Not overly sweet either.
Bourbon in general is gonna be sweeter given its mash bill of mostly corn. If you liked the rye, I‚Äôd suggest high rye bourbons like Old Grandad, particularly the 114 proof version, although the Bottled in Bond is good on its own too. Any high rye will do well though, particularly if it‚Äôs a high percentage of rye.

Wild Turkey (and Russel‚Äôs Reserve if you have it there) are good high rye mash bills usually. Maker‚Äôs is wheated, so it‚Äôll be sweeter.

There‚Äôs also just rye whiskey instead of bourbon.
Rye is very similar but generally less sweet since the corn is reduced and the rye is increased
Scotch ‚Ä¶.
Just buy scotch, bourbon is going to be sweet because of the mandatory corn content.
All bourbon is sweet , try to get straight whiskey or rye or wheated
So two reasons Bourbon is sweet.  One is the mandatory >50% corn in the mash (which can be up to 100% and still be called Bourbon) - corn distillate tends to have a sweet aroma, which isn't actually sweet but reads that way. The second reason is the barrel, new charred American oak, where a lot of sugar comes from (depolymerized cellulose and hemicellulose, which are polymers of sugar).  Most of those extractives go into the spirit very fast, thought they do concentrate a bit as angel's share evaporates. So since the new charred barrel thing is a requirement, you're going to have some of that regardless (also in rye).
This is a good choice, and Wild Turkey 101. Any high rye bourbon. Or maybe even some ryes as well
I've never tried forty Creek, but it's on my Canadian whisky list, I'll give it a try for sure!
I'm open on american whisky, I was just surprised to drink more Buffalo trace than I thought üòÖ
I don't know what you're smoking, but 1910 is one of the sweetest bourbons I can think of.
It so one of the sweetest tasting bourbons I‚Äôve ever had as well. It‚Äôs delicious, but sweet!"
I absolutely loved this pour,"So the reviews on this have been everywhere from it‚Äôs amazing to it should be poured down the drain. Let me get this out of the way, this is not worth 275 bones, but let‚Äôs be honest, what is? It is, however, we‚Äôll executed and unique. If you have the means to, I‚Äôd still recommend it. There is one, big, and I hope obvious caveat. If you don‚Äôt enjoy rum, you aren‚Äôt going to like this. I don‚Äôt find the finish overbearing but it is certainly present and a big part of the experience. 

This smells and tastes like the beach in a glass. It‚Äôs that beautiful wild Turkey tobacco and funk that got drunk on rum, so you get the spice and fruit notes to go with it. It is thick as pancake syrup, and has a finish that went on for minutes. So much so that I joked I didn‚Äôt want to eat dinner because I could still taste the masters keep. I come down on this being a 9/10, it is a top 5 pour all time for me. I can absolutely see why some people don‚Äôt enjoy it, but it suits my tastes perfectly.","I bet it‚Äôs sweet
Go Avs! At least you have great tastes in whiskey haha! Cheers
I‚Äôll say 100% the best rum finished whiskey I‚Äôve had. And was pleasantly surprised how good it was. Secondary is a lot but MSRP and Wild Turkey fan would be happy buying this.
As candy
Sorry I‚Äôm not a big rivalry guy lol, I like my team, don‚Äôt hate anyone else. Besides, the Bolts have 3 cups in a 31 year existence, with a ridiculous performance over the last decade. So what they lost a cup, they lost in 15 too, doesn‚Äôt detract from how impressive the resume has been. Besides, the Avs just saw how hard it is to go B2B, but they‚Äôll be in contention again this season. 

But yeah, the whiskey was great, get a bottle if you can!
I was pleased enough that I got a backup. Lucked into a bottle at Kroger, then took some out of town friends to the distillery, walked in and saw they had it. Second bottle for me, happy to have that one in the bunker.
Go Bolts!
Go Bolts! I‚Äôm always surprised that glencairn gets noticed as much as it does in pics."
Heaven Hill Bottled-In-Bond,"This weekend‚Äôs addition to the shelf. I had been looking for this one for quite awhile now. I keep seeing folks post finds but it‚Äôs been evading me. Well a [good] buddy of mine found it and scooped it up for me. We cracked it open tonight for a tasting. 

On the nose I get a little sweetness followed by a bit of peanut. Not much burn from the alcohol

Taste wise the peanut really is the forefront. But there‚Äôs some sweeter notes of caramel that are also playing with a bit of an earthy flavor that I can‚Äôt really pin down. There‚Äôs also this hint of spice, not like a rye spice but almost on the border of cinnamon. It‚Äôs pretty interesting and quite pleasant. It‚Äôs got a good mouthfeel and fully coats the palate.

As for the finish the spiciness becomes a bit more pronounced along side the caramelly sweetness. The peanut sort of fades away and just a touch of heat remains.

Overall a very good pour and I am happy to have it on the shelf. I‚Äôve sampled other offerings from Heaven Hill and they‚Äôve all been delightful, however rarely are they obtainable. This 7 year BiB seems to be scarce enough to be huntable yet common enough to be findable. This combined with a fair price of $50 makes it one of my new favorite finds.","Love it.  I don‚Äôt get peanut though.
I bought this one for myself and my dad recently.  It was ok.  Tasted like every other Bourbon I've bought at that price point.  Didn't know it was sought after; seemed ordinary.
It seems like most people don‚Äôt. I was reading some other folks reviews and they talk about chocolate and cherries and I don‚Äôt get any of that at all. But I get a whole lot of peanuts, which no one else gets. I guess it‚Äôs just one of those funny things
What would you compare it to?"
The Great Whiskey Challenge Blind Tasting & Review #1 : Wild Turkey Edition,,"I've recently become an Executive Bourbon Steward through Moonshine University Stave & Thief. Wanting to further my experience with Whiskey, Bourbon specifically. Hope to do more of these Whiskey Challenges just to do something a little bit different than everyone else. Let's get into it!  
Starting with a tough one. I don't know if this was a good place to start, but have to start somewhere, right?   
   
Wild Turkey Distillery  
Lawrenceburg, Kentucky   
Brands : Wild Turkey & Russell's Reserve  
Master Distiller : Jimmy Russell & Eddie Russell  
Bourbon Mash Bill : 75% Corn, 13% Rye, 12% Barley  
   
Glass A : Wild Turkey Rare Breed 116.8 Proof  
This is the barrel proof offering of Wild Turkey and it's a good one.   
Nose : I get a bit of apricot, caramel, brown spice and oak mixed with a little bit of ethanol that let's you know you're above 110 proof. It's very appealing and yet complex  
Palate : It starts a little spicy from the rye with a dark fruit flavor mixed in with the caramel sweetness and some of the oaky notes to create a fantastic flavor profile that anyone who's a fan of Wild Turkey has grown to love.  
Finish : Long and slightly oily mouthfeel  
   
Glass B : Russell's Reserve 10yr 90 Proof  
Standard offering spin-off from the Master Distillers themselves  
Nose : I'm getting a bit of sweet fruit up front with a bit of toffee and vanilla in there as well with the oak just kind of hiding in the background and very little ethanol.  
Palate : Sweet fruit taste with toffee, vanilla and spice. A quite pleasant typical Bourbon that everyone can enjoy.  
Finish : Short but sweet, leaves the spicy, oaky flavor for just a bit to leave you wanting another sip.  
   
Glass C : Russell's Reserve Single Barrell Selection 110 Proof  
My bottle was one selected by Eddie Russell himself for Shore's Liquor  
Nose : It's got heavy brown spice and rye blended nicely with the caramel, vanilla and oak notes as well as a dark fruit coming through with a nice punch of ethanol.   
Palate : Similar to the nose the palate comes through with a balance of oak, spice and caramel nicely balanced by the dark fruit flavor with a touch of ethanol that doesn't punch you in the face.   
Finish : Nice and long finish with the rye spice sticking around for a bit  
   
Overall I say this was a tough one to start with because of the very similar profiles we have here. They all contain the same mash bill so we're splitting hairs with age, blend of barrels, and proof points here. In the blind I'd say the 10 yr stuck out like a sore thumb being it has a short finish, smell of ethanol is very low and the color wants to give it away right off the bat. The other 2 were extremely difficult to judge because they seemed so similar it was hard to distinguish between them.   
   
My outcome in the Blind Whiskey Challenge ended up with Rare Breed in first place. It just seemed overall more balanced and I think that comes from years of blending experience by the Master Distillers. Russell's Reserve Single Barrell Selection comes in second with a little too my much oak to balance it properly but that's kind of what you get with single barrels some will be better than others. Russell's Reserve 10 came in last but is definitely still a really good Bourbon, one of my go to daily drinkers, very smooth and a quintessential Bourbon."
Review #4: Starlight Cigar Batch r/bourbon Pick,"
post doesn't seem to show up in r/bourbon for me so apologies if it does eventually 

After missing out the quick sellout on the original wave, I was lucky enough to snag a bottle from the recent safety case some time back. The flavor notes from Jay on this bottle seemed pretty wild and uncharacteristic of typical whiskey tasting notes. Plus ya know, amburana finishes has been the hot trend these days. Let‚Äôs see if the hype holds up!

ABV: 54.35%

Age: 4 years 6 months, 6 months finished in Amburana barrels 

Barrel #: 22-2590

Price: $90

Rested for 10 minutes in a glencairn

Nose ‚Äì Huh??? What even is this? Cinnabon-adjacent icing but with a barnyard funk to it, like fresh fertilizer. Gingersnap EVERYWHERE! Vanilla bean syrup, the effervescence of an Entemann‚Äôs angel food cake, and basically zero bourbon notes. That‚Äôs not to say the nose isn‚Äôt inviting, it is just unbelievely dessert forward, like a rum baba with gingersnap icing. It‚Äôs that powerful.

Palate ‚Äì Good lord. Basically the nose but with a stronger ‚Äúoak‚Äù influence. I put oak in quotations because I‚Äôm still not entirely sure if that‚Äôs the Brazilian oak I‚Äôm tasting or just the cornucopia of mystifying flavors that I would imagine what a giant vat filled with cognac, brandy, whiskey, and rum would taste like. That Cinnabon flavor is front and center, but I still hesitate to call it full Cinnabon ‚Äì there‚Äôs just something extra behind it like a creme brulee kinda vibe. I quickly thought up of an analogy while sipping on this.

It‚Äôs like Grandma‚Äôs Christmas fruitcake that was drenched in Jamaican rum, fell off the table, then kept falling all the way down into the basement, and was left there for five years. After that time, you suddenly found the cake and for some reason decided to cut out a big slice to eat. Why? Whatever the reason was, you utter to yourself in a state of shock and bewilderment, ‚ÄúWhy in the blue blazes is this SO GOOD?‚Äù. That was my feeling the entire time from the start.

Finish ‚Äì It is now several weeks, and the flavors have still lingered. Yes, the finish is/was/always will be incredibly long, funky as the day is long (think a bake sale in the middle of a barn), and full of blustering and robust oak. Or at least I think that‚Äôs the Brazilian oak. But I digress! Point is the finish is unimaginably long, strong, and a definite gateway to gorging on Cinnabons.

Thoughts ‚Äì This is not whiskey, this is an experience. It was a roller coaster ride from the beginning to the end with zero breaks in between. I didn‚Äôt even get to rate the burn and the mouthfeel because honestly, who cares? The flavor profile was outstanding due to its sheer amount of complex and ubiquitous flavors that stick to you like cigarette smoke. In a good way, of course. I‚Äôm not a cigar guy but I imagine this would totally hold up against the fiercest of cigars. The barnyard funk wasn‚Äôt a detraction for me personally, but I can see why that‚Äôd be a turn-off for others along with the non-existent bourbon notes. You‚Äôre either going to fall in love with the in-your-face cinnagingeroak rum cake flavors or be disgusted by it. No in-between, none.

With all that said, it‚Äôs a personal 9 from me as it STILL could have been better with some adjustments and I really couldn‚Äôt drink more than an ounce at a time. Truly a special occasion treat and an immediate crowd pleaser (or destroyer). I am all-in on Starlight‚Äôs finished products and even just got their 1948 Spanish Brandy finish! That‚Äôs for another time though‚Ä¶

Rating ‚Äì 9

Ratings Scale

1 ‚Äì Straight to jail, right away 

2 ‚Äì Poor, no redeeming qualities 

3 ‚Äì Mediocre, but cheap 

4 ‚Äì Average, you could probably do better 

5 ‚Äì Okay, worth a gamble 

6 ‚Äì Solid, a daily staple 

7 ‚Äì Pretty good, a strong recommend 

8 ‚Äì Hot damn! I need more of this immediately!

9 ‚Äì Holy Toledo! Do I keep this a secret?

10 ‚Äì Perfection. Bliss. Truly the best in its product class","Where'd you get this? I didn't even see it on Starlights website?
Been looking for 1 of those
Picked up a local store pick of this last week. Barrel 23-2066, 114.9 proof, 6yr age statement on the label. It‚Äôs phenomenal, may need to back it up. Not sure how fast it‚Äôs going, the place still had cases of it piled up lol.
single barrel.program, Jay had a safety case of this on sharedpour some time ago and I was lucky enough to snag one before the sell out
Heading to Starlight next month. I'd love if they had it to sell.
I hope you get lucky! it's a show stopper for better or worse
I have been there 10+ times.  Only time I have seen any Cigar batch was a release.  Sold over 600 bottles and they were gone.  They did have a bottle behind the bar a few weeks ago.  Might get to try it though."
A visit to Liberty Pole Spirits new distillery,"Ive been hearing some buzz around the new Liberty Pole Spirits distillery in Washington PA recently so I decided to stop in on my way south on Interstate 79 this weekend. If anything, the buzz I heard about this place was, in my opinion, understated.  If you are traveling through southwestern PA on either Interstate 79 or 70, this place should be on your radar.  I got there on Saturday and managed to snag a couple spots on one of their tours so I could experience the entire facility.

The tour starts with a brief history of the distillery and the whiskey rebellion upon which the brand is based before proceeding to the production for a very comprehensive discussion of their production methodology. Next is a walk through of their 5 story wooden rickhouse, the only one in PA apparently, and another comprehensive discussion of maturation. The tour ends with a seated flight tasting of their core whiskeys as well as any distillery only product they may have.  In my case, I got to taste and purchase a single barrel straight rye that they released that day.  They called the release Banana Bread for the subtle banana notes and it came in at a solid 109.9 proof.  There were only a few bottles left when I purchased mine and I saw on their IG page that they had sold out of all 218 bottles by that afternoon.  The tour guide told me that they are planning on a higher end tour that will include barrel thiefing and filling your own bottles.

After the tour we found a table in the beautiful tasting room (it felt like we were transported to an 18th century tavern) and had a pretty amazing craft cocktail. Based on the large crowd in the tasting room, they must have a big local following for their cocktails.

I've done a lot of distillery tours at both heritage and craft distilleries and this tour is definitely in my top 2 or 3 and is well worth a visit if you're a whiskey or history buff.","Everything they do is incredible. Favorite home state Distillery.
I was truly impressed!"
Anyone had this before?,Guy at the store said they just got them in and would be gone in a day or two.,"These are all great and I don‚Äôt even like regular Makers.
It‚Äôs one of my favorites in the Wood Finishing Series.
Yep! It‚Äôs damn good!
Very good. Better than last year's BRT 01 and 02 imo and those were good too.
I love my 110 proof BEP, it‚Äôs probably my favorite bottle I own. I‚Äôve heard worse reviews on the 109 proof but it‚Äôll still be good
I have 2. Very good pour!
Delicious. Will be looking for a backup to my backup
The Safeway out here has had these for months.  $70
Yup. Tasty.
It's delicious.
These are always good!
Wow. Trying to find one in Oregon and it feels impossible
I luckily walked into a store in CO the day they put it out. It was the only one in the series I didn't have yet. After my first try, I would say it falls somewhere in the middle of the series. RC6 is still the best in my opinion.
Very good pour! Bought a back up I enjoyed it that much
""Finished with 10 virgin oak staves""

This is what happens when good whiskeys go to the afterlife.
I‚Äôve polished off two bottles. TW has it still here so waiting to get another when it gets low.
Yes, I literally just had an ounce. I have about half a bottle left. For some odd reason Makers Wood Finishing Series remind me of fall. It had a lot of depth and flavor. Enjoy
Solid pull
Got the 2021 FAe-02 great pour wish I had gotten 2 when I did
Where did you land that? . It's had really good reviews on here!
Very gooood
Solid pull
I‚Äôve always seen people with Maker‚Äôs Mark, never tried it before though. Looks kinda tasty
They are all great honestly
There a store that has 15 bottles but they are all $120
Yes, it‚Äôs a solid pour
I like it
Curious how much different this is than their 46 barrel proof
Have one I am waiting to open for a special occasion. Heard amazing things about it! Enjoy!
Very earthy tasting IMO
Hell yeah
Only bottle I keep a backup or two of. It‚Äôs the bottle that showed me how great bourbon can be
I snagged one a few months ago because I head this would be the last wood finishing series! I don't want to Crack it until I find another. Doesn't compare at all to larceny barrel proof?
Great stuff, I like it chilled tho
Every time I see something like this that I really want to try, I get sad and mad that europe doesn‚Äòt import most of that stuff.. If you want bourbon you get the classics and maybe some special versions and thats it‚Ä¶
Chefs kiss
It's a banger, wish I could fund one on the shelf but had a pour and it was excellent
Would kill to have one
Good stuff, worth a try, but IMO, this one is the ‚Äúworst‚Äù of the wood finishing series (worst being a comparative term relative to its MM wood finishing brethren only)

I love the wood finishing series, but it makes me a little sad knowing I can't get the ones I like again.
I REALLY like BRT-02. This is better?
Same.
Go grab some. Apparently this is the 5th and FINAL release of it. They do it once a year and this is the last time
Lucky me has a local shop that has a shelf full of these and claims they still have a full case in the back lol

I have to say though, comparing the BRTs and the BEP to the FAE and regular Maker's, the FAE for me falls much closer to the base product than the other offerings in the wood finishing series, and I really kinda hate base Maker's
They are sitting on shelves here in NM
NH liquor stores just got them today. Employee said it‚Äôs a once a year thing and they‚Äôre gone in a day or two
Mine was $70. I got it in NH tho where the state runs the liquor stores so they can‚Äôt mark up too much
Haha good eye
I'd say, just like a lot of bourbons, it's up to your flavor profile preference. I do like BRT-02 more than BRT 0-1 but imo, they are both a little too sweet to drink as often even though I still really enjoy them. The BEP is less on the sweet side and that is more palatable to me so I'd be willing to drink it more often. Either way I bet you'd still enjoy it whether or not its better than the BRT-02 to you. Sorry for the ramble lol
Same here but apparently they were just released. Grab it while you can. Was just in Santa Fe this weekend
In Albuquerque I presume?
Damn, I randomly saw it on their website today, figured it was more prevalent and I could wait a bit. Snagged a Found North Calvados SB instead.
Yup I was wondering.. I got some from Nashua
Your explanation proving ‚Äúdifferent strokes‚Äù‚Ä¶ your rationale for why you prefer BEP over BRT is exactly why I prefer BRT over BEP‚Ä¶ so at least we are ‚Äútasting‚Äù the same things.
I need to check Kelly's here in Cruces.
Yeah. Santa Fe too"
Surprise party,"I‚Äôm throwing a surprise 40th bday party and rented out a small bar in Hollywood. The bar doesn‚Äôt have a kitchen so I need to figure out how to feed 50 people. I‚Äôm trying to do a ‚Äúwhiskey/speakeasy vibe‚Äù and the venue has a small patio w a little bar that I was thinking could be whiskey tasting at.. which would be kinda general and idk how to really go about that with the crowd bc now everyone drinks whiskey. Anyway, so I need to cater the event. I was thinking maybe getting bbq catered but getting tacos catered is about $1,200 cheaper.. is it weird to do tacos at this type of themed party, or is it fine bc ‚Äúeveryone loves tacos‚Äù? I should note that the dress code is kinda wedding guest clothes, so no jeans, tshirts etc. please tell me your thoughts! Thanks!",
Celebrating the Bills opening season game with a taste of Penelope Rio Batch 2 & a review in comments.,,"This post didn't age well
Tough loss lol
Finish: Tastes like a loss but at least your quarterback can still walk
Penelope Rio Batch 2

Finish: honey & amburana

Msrp: 90

Proof: 98

Age: 4-6 years though NAS applied

Mash bill: 75% Corn, 7% Rye, 15% Wheat, 3% Malted Barley

Nose: strong ethanol & straight up cinnamon toast!

Palate: sweet heat! It‚Äôs loads of cinnamon & brown sugar with some vanilla hiding in between and just the right amount of honey coming through. 

Finish: creamy mouth feel, lots of oak & that really nice tobacco profile coming in strong from the amburana wood & the slightest dry earthiness from the 3% single malt right at the end. Medium length finish. 

Final thoughts: believe the hype! This is a great pour. Drinks a little hotter than it‚Äôs proof. Especially if your a fan of either honey finishes or cigar batches that use amburana. I like amburana finishes a lot. It always leaves a great cinnamon flavor along with some tobacco & vanilla. I haven‚Äôt had one I haven‚Äôt liked. I have tried quit a few honey finishes & I‚Äôm on the fence about them because I have tasted four or five and didn‚Äôt like half of them. But liked the others. Sometimes they‚Äôre bitter or just way over powering. This one is just the right amount and not bitter at all. Penelope does a fantastic job balancing both with that fantastic MGP mash bill. I heard prior to getting this that it is cinnamon toast crunch in a bottle. And I have to agree with that. It‚Äôs pretty spot on. Now I have to say I also like sweeter pours as well which this definitely is. It reminds of Angel‚Äôs Envy Rye. Which is also a very sweet almost dessert like pour. Which some people really don‚Äôt like due to the sweetness. So if your one of those guys/girls (which is fine, we all have our likes and dislikes) then this may not be for you. Either way I say give it a try. You never know! 

Rating: 90/100
Hope the bottle is still full!
Loved batch 1 and looking to get a bottle of batch 2.  Whereabouts did you find it?
Great review! Love rio! It‚Äôs a controversial bottle but if you like amburana finishes it‚Äôs fantastic.
Oh yeah!
Go Bills!
Rushed OT way to fast
Yikes!
A friend out of state sent it
Oh yeah! I have a homebrew imperial stout I aged on amburana as well as some bourbon mash white dog I just threw some into."
Lucky day ü§ôüèæ,"So I live in a lIquor controlled state (PA) and while that does mean we don‚Äôt usually get price gouged for highly allocated stuff, it does mean that we don‚Äôt get a ton of highly allocated stuff or it usually sell out immediately.

I just got back from Vacation in New Orleans and went to the cigar shop to grab some sticks. When I went to the grocery store in that area I found found a FW&GS that I never realized was there. Not a Chairman Select or Premium store so I didn‚Äôt really have high expectation but I make it a point to stop in any liquor stores I come across if I have time because ‚Äúyou never know‚Äù.

Browsing was uneventful as it was stocked with the usual stuff. But low and behold at the end of the bourbon section, on the top shelf was 4 bottles of Bookers Apprentice Batch at $99. Now mind you $99 isn‚Äôt a lot of money for me. For something I consider quality I wont even blink at that price point. So I bought 2 lol.

After some research I realized it was the apprentice batch. Not a lot of favorable reviews. Now let me preface this by saying I‚Äôm predominantly a Scotch drinker. Peated scotch being my preference. But my collection runs the gauntlet all the way to bourbon. I absolutely love this bourbon. Heavy butterscotch notes. Vanilla. Orange. And a funky malt like quality. I don‚Äôt know what the bad reviews are about but if this is the worst Bookers I‚Äôm looking forward to trying the rest üòÇ.","I am with you.    I am not sure where the dislike is coming from.  Maybe it is a price point thing?  Is this the best Booker‚Äôs batch, no.  At least not in my opinion, but it holds up well in side by side tastings of the last three releases.
Yeah idk. From what I‚Äôve seen in terms of reactions/reviews price definitely comes into play. And while this is my first Booker‚Äôs I‚Äôm far from new to whiskey in general or bourbon specifically. One thing I‚Äôve noticed is bourbon drinkers tend to not like scotch. Especially the peated stuff. And most of the reviewers who gave this a negative review complained about a sourness and distinct ‚Äúfunk‚Äù. As a scotch drinker I like a bit of funk he‚Äôll even a lot of funk lol. That and the heavy butterscotch/caramel notes are right up my alley. I get it may not be the prototypical bookers but I found it delicious. Glad I found it and glad I bought two ü§ôüèæ"
"New here, 1st post. Front me or guide me","If there are related posts, please guide me and I will delete my shitpost. And English is not my main language, so sorry for any grammar mistakes.

I have tried various whiskies in my past.

I have watched videos and read reviews from self-proclaimed whisky connoisseurs.

I have tried the, from my perspective, bottom of the barrel stuff like Jack Daniels and Jim Beam and no, thats not my stuff.

I don't know if my taste is really off, but pure Jack Daniels has a kind of (chemical) banana flavour to me, which feels very weird.

I've tried other brands too, like Laphroig, but the smoky taste is too much for me. Loch Lomond was the cheapest I could find and with a couple of ice cubes it tasted as smooth as a Heineken, which tastes like water to me but gives me a headache the next morning.

I would like to get some complex aromas and flavours while aming at something around... \~100 bucks a bottle? Just for some rare occasions/evenings when I feel the need for something special like enjoying a rump steak or something instead of basic ""staying alive food"".

In the end Tullamore Dew is my go to cuz I get about 1L for 20 bucks and I like the taste which is a bit honey-like when I open a fresh bottle and smell it.

I am always curious about those reviews that say ""aw, I taste the oak/cherry barrel flavours with a slight hint of x/y/z."" but I dont want to spend like 600 bucks for a 750ml bottle.

I dont know if I have given enough information about my preferences. If there is anything I should add, please let me know AND: Oh, bourbon seems to give me heartburn.

Thanks in advance!","JD No 7 and Jim Beam are low cost whiskey and can be sipped straight but most times used  as a mixer whiskey's in Coke, in mixed drinks. JD 90% of the time, regardless of the bottle, will have a bit of banana taste & that's totally normal.  
  
You get heartburn from the bourbon's you listed. Here's a few suggestions - especially since you like (it seems) lighter Irish whiskey's like Tullamore - maybe a little more on the fruit / honey side.  These are < $100 in most places.  
  
Green Spot Irish Whiskey - light, fruity, honey, 40% abv.  
  
Red Breast 12 year - more complex, more flavor, biscuit, shortbread, some honey, a little oak, darker fruit, 40% abv.  
  
Sagamore Spirit Double Oak Rye - vanilla, caramel, candied pecans, more sweet than the others 48 abv.

&#x200B;

All three of these can be sipped, put on ice, used as a mixer.
Maybe look into bourbon. The way whiskey bourbon is made you‚Äôll usually be more into the brown butter, caramel, butterscotch, etc. type of flavor profile. Honey too. Lots of bourbons out there with oak, spice, etc. but not as Smokey or peaty as Irish whiskey.
Just a curious question: is there a special whiskey that gives you the ""wow effect""?

I know it really depends on your taste
Edit: guide me on the informative posts if/is my question obvious. Ty
Maybe varieties of bourbon won't give me the heartburn. I will have a look into it, thank you for the advice
There are only a very small number of peated Irish whiskies (Connemara would be the most prevalent, and there's some from Echlinville Distillery called Three Crowns). Most are not peated at all."
Elijah Craig Barrel Proof,"Hello everybody.. So my first EGBP is Batch C922 and it is absolutely amazing one of the first bourbons where I can really find tasting notes and every sip I am like ‚Äúman that is good!‚Äù.
One of the first bourbons where I actually want to find a back up.
I have heard many great things about Batch A123 and how it is a lot of people‚Äôs favorites.

Being in LA I can‚Äôt find it anywhere and have been looking for months.
Long story short I‚Äôm working in Decatur, Alabama and a liquor store has many Batch A123 for $109.99‚Ä¶. I know MSRP is around $70-75.

My question is for those who have had Batch A123 would you be willing to buy it for $109.99 not including tax.

Thanks!","Ask for a deal on two if you pay cash, or offer to crack it on the spot and share a pour.
K&L wines !
Solid ca company retailer. My go-to besides seelbachs.
They have A123 and B523 for 69.99 each.
All of them are good - just varying levels of how good.  I‚Äôm very lucky to be in an area that gets ECBP at the first drop - got C923 yesterday
Nope, that's too high
Nope, A123 wasn't my favorite batch and B523 is even a bit worse. Both are worth $70ish but not over $85 when you could grab bookers. C923 is going to be incredible though so I would just put everything into hunting that one
The Windmill in Hampton Cove had A123 in July for around $80
You may want to consider waiting for the upcoming C923 release. It's 133 proof and 13 year old bourbon from what I've read and could be a keeper since EC will remove the 12 year age statement moving forward.
I would not expect A123 to taste exactly like C922 - the ECBP series does show some variations in flavor, with some batch#s, in my experience particularly the C ones, showing a stronger cask influence with more tannic flavors. Other batches, particularly the Bs, can be lighter and sweeter.

This variability in the ECBP series makes it interesting, and less duplicative to pick up multiple different batch#s.

For that reason, this is probably a fair pickup even with the price above MSRP (which is becoming something of a polite fiction in the bourbon market lately). Ask yourself how many other barrel proof bourbons in a well made and respected series, with a stated age of more than 10 years, you can find for $110 or less. At least in my local market, the answer is: not many.

I hope you enjoy either it, or whatever else you decide to spend your money on.
A123 is, in my opinion, the best ECBP batch of recent years. Yes of course many older batches (like most the pirate bottles) are better but this one is stellar. I have several back ups of it. Luckily in NY I was able to get them all at MSRP. That being said yes I would pay slightly over $100 on this particular batch because it is so delicious to me. On other recent batches I would not.
If you‚Äôre from LA I‚Äôd recommend going to K&L. They have it for MSRP. They have a store in my neck of the woods(SF) as well as a store in LA.
I bought 5 mini Blantons bottles (some for friends) and a bottle of Coopers Craft 100 proof and tried to negotiate but he said since it‚Äôs a controlled state he has to keep the price what it is‚Ä¶
I have heard of K&L wines but have never been. Il call them and ask!
Thank you!!
That‚Äôs a awesome find
I do love me some bookers,I watched some reviews on the C923 and heard it very good. Il have to keep an eye out!
Thank you!
I heard of this as well‚Ä¶ I watched some reviews and heard its incredible.
Thank you I really appreciate it, I‚Äôm going to have to think on it for a few days. 
I really like that the batches are different so you can experience different products/brands from the same distillery. 
I don‚Äôt mind spending to much over especially when it‚Äôs a solid product but just hesitant since its $40 over.
That is complete BS. Unfortunately Alabama liquor laws make it one of the hardest states to purchase whiskey in. ECBP is actually on their allocated list for the state ABC stores and the state lists the price at $74.99. The owner (probably a private store) is lying if he states the store is required by law to sell at $110. Unfortunately this is all too common and the few times I've found an interesting bottle in Alabama it's always been marked up.

To answer your last question - I find A123 to be my favorite batches so far, have bought multiple and still would not pay $110 for a bottle. I would recommend being patient and eventually you'll be lucky.
If LA is Louisiana you are out of luck. They can‚Äôt ship to Louisiana or Alabama.

I know he is lying but I know that‚Äôs how they do business unfortunately.. 
Definitely hard to find good bottles in Alabama.. especially I don‚Äôt have a Alabama license so I can‚Äôt get any ABC drops‚Ä¶ But that is okay.

Thank you! I really appreciate it that‚Äôs how I kinda feel with that price.
Unfortunately you are correct. According to the Shipping page on their site:

Beer and **distilled spirits** can only be shipped within the state of California.
Thank you! I‚Äôm just hoping they still have it in stock by the time I get home in October!
Order now, and pick up later. They'll hold your orders when you are ready
I did not think they would hold. That is awesome thank you!
K&L usually gets their stuff a month or two after the release. Both A123 and B523 are awesome, so pick them up while you can at $69.99"
What I‚Äôm currently working through,"Nothing super fancy here, important part is all of it is decent tasting. 

Only one I‚Äôm not actually that fond of is the Green River Wheated Bourbon. I don‚Äôt like the finish at all. It‚Äôs overwhelmed by grain, tannins and a sort of dirt taste, almost to the point that I expect grit when I chew it, almost like it‚Äôs boiled river water on a camping trip. I think these notes might be like cinnamon, clove, and allspice under the right conditions.

I wonder if this was due to over charred barrels or something, but I think it‚Äôs more likely due to the extra wheat in the mash bill because presumably these bottles are blended from vast array of different barrel chars. Barrel char is the hardest variable to control just because there are so many processes happening so fast and we don‚Äôt really understand which ones matter and which don‚Äôt. If a barrel is aging poorly you have years to figure it out. If a mash isn‚Äôt taking off, you have weeks, but a barrel chars in under a minute. 

Maker‚Äôs CS is wonderful. I love it. I actually like that isn‚Äôt super aged. If you ever have Maker‚Äôs Mark White, it might make more sense why I say that. They have a great mash bill and lower barreling proof and imho, it just doesn‚Äôt really need mellowing that much. I wish they just sold CS. I don‚Äôt need any of their other offerings. 

Old forester 100 is nice. It‚Äôs great neat and on the rocks. I think it‚Äôs best on the rocks. This bourbon to me is basically what I go for in place of stuff like BT. Straight bourbon, reasonable amount of rye. Sweet, vanilla, caramel, overall slightly plain. Only a little spice. Point is this bourbon doesn‚Äôt snatch your attention away. It‚Äôs just there. It‚Äôs good for needing a drink but not wanting to pay attention to said drink. 

Rowan‚Äôs Creek is far and away my favorite. The sour mash breaks through, which I love. It‚Äôs not too sweet, really well balanced. Light and easy drinking. Great mouthfeel, nice and crisp. Not oily at all. Perfect right out the bottle.","of, makers and green river thumbs up. for me white dog and rowan‚Äôs not good."
"Was a rough day, luckily TW treated me to some nice finds today",A friend gave me a cigar to try the other day and I decided to pick some up today. My TW had some really well reviewed ones so I swung by earlier and found some Michters Bourbon which they NEVER have at my store. Picked up a My Father Le Bijou 1922 Torpedo and all I can say is wow! Tastes like a chocolate salted pretzel. It pairs so amazingly with the heavy caramel of the Michters. Really glad I swung by there today after the way the rest of the day has gone,

Overall: this is good stuff. Very interesting complexity as I work my way through the pour. That oaky warmth and cinnamon/baking spice is there all the way through. The sweet/caramel note is there as well, although not as evident as it was the very first sniff. If you like oaky/baking spice notes (which I do), you will like this a lot.

After learning what I‚Äôve been drinking, I have to say, this is a great value bourbon at something like $45. I believe Wheeler‚Äôs sources their bourbon, but then finishes it in their distillery in Nolensville, TN. Pick some up if you can find it.

Review #1: double blind face off AKA how to end up looking dumb (swipe for reveal),"
I figured what is harder than starting to review whiskey? Reviewing whiskey head to head against other whiskey when you have no clue which is which and then looking dumb on the internet as a result. 

So as someone who looks dumb all the time I figured why not look dumb on the internet. 

The wife was set loose on the whiskey stockpile (picture 3) to choose any two whiskies for me to taste and review blind. I have no idea what I am drinking other than they are 2 of the ~30ish bottles that I have open currently (and it‚Äôs unlikely to be her absolute favorite as she won‚Äôt waste it by giving any of it to me) 

So without further ado I‚Äôll jump right into looking dumb. 


__Nose:__

A- Nose is great. Textbook bourbon nose for me (he writes really hoping it is a bourbon). Sweet cherry and oak. Smells pretty well aged not young and bright at all. Really strong and enjoyable nose. Maybe a buffalo trace cherry sweetness. Really smells like a special whiskey and not a mid shelf sipper. 

B- Dramatically less appealing nose. Bit of a dry erase marker, corn and ethanol. After a textbook swirl job and really getting my nose in there I pick up a little oak and sweetness that isn‚Äôt just caned sweet corn but it is much lighter and weaker nose overall and what is there is just not as good as glass A 



__Palate:__

A- Definitely bourbon. Nose carries through to the palate somewhat but not as bold or loud as one might have hoped for how good the nose is. Lingers pretty well and is all together enjoyable and hits all the correct notes if not first chair of the symphony. The oak that is the star of the nose shows up just a bit fleeting, viscosity and mouth feel is fine but doesn‚Äôt live up to the promise of the nose. Oak transitions nicely into some chocolate spice and on sips 2 and three it really lingers nicely. Not the most complex sips or anything really special but really what one hopes to find in a Bourbon is all there and accounted for. Oaky, dark chocolate, minimal sweet cherry. Hints of tobacco. Ruling out any buffalo trace. The proof is low but not offensively so. All in all quite good. 

B- Chocolate, orange zest, and an assortment of spices, some good complex spice burn and some ethanol burn. Chocolate and orange is like one of those booze filled chocolate candies with orange filling. Dark, sweet, citrus zest, quite nice. Drinks hotter than A and not all for the better. Maybe a bit of cinnamon, like spicy red hot kind of cinnamon. Pretty strong coppery taste throughout like someone left a bunch of pennies in the bottle for some strange reason. The initial wave is quite good with Kit Kat and orange zest but then it hangs around too long and keeps going when it should have gotten off the stage. Strange funk brings B down.

__Finish:__

A- subtle but noticeable ‚Äòdusty‚Äô slightly bitter note in the finish. I don‚Äôt mind it but I think it‚Äôs a minus for A along with a general lack of complexity and a bit low on proof. It sings an enjoyable song if unremarkable. Happy to have had it but not getting its name tattooed on the ass cheek. 

B- The more it keeps talking the worse it gets as the strange funk, or maybe the dry erase note from the nose, starts to take over and the ethanol burn yells a bit too loud. I wouldn‚Äôt usually want a whiskey to drop off quicker but I think a faster finish here would be doing B some favors. 

 __Overall__

A- Overall this checks all the notes on the bourbon checklist. Oak, just enough cherry & sweetness, good nose all together just solid. Interesting if not perfect lingering notes on the finish. Above average and into better than good territory. 

B- This one grew on me a bit as I worked my way though the pour but it loses to A in this face off for sure. Nose is weak. Front of palate is really good just kinda funky after its strong start and as it lingers the funk takes over. I like it but don‚Äôt love it.

A- 7.5
B- 6.5

Post reveal comments- Well I did say at the beginning I was going to look dumb on the internet. The wife picked two from the stash and the ‚ÄòTotal Wine special‚Äô won. Probably not the result that was supposed to happen given how much deserved flack TW gets for how they push their Chestnut farms stuff on the unsuspecting public and how much they charge for what is essentially 1792 in a fancy bottle. 

That said I am quite surprised with how much I enjoyed it when it was blind and I didn‚Äôt have the baggage of knowing how much I paid for it and how they market and sell it. Chestnut Farms.. pretty solid pour so long as you aren‚Äôt the one who paid for it or, in my case tonight, aren‚Äôt aware that you‚Äôre drinking it.",
Kings County High-Rye Single Barrel came in the mail today,"I love KCD stuff especially the single barrel cask strength I got from a private selection.

"What‚Äôs your definition of complexity in a whiskey (bourbon, rye, Irish or etc)?","So I‚Äôve read a lot of reviews, feedback or comments about a certain spirit.  Some state they like or dislike something because of a lack or loaded with complexity.  What‚Äôs your definition of complexity and please include the notes your looking for.","Well, ""complex"" by definition is just something that consists of many different parts, so in whiskey that means one where you can smell and taste many different things. The notes can vary since there is a lot of variety in different styles of whiskey. 

In bourbon, this can mean a combination of oak, vanilla, brown sugar, red fruits, cinnamon, and chocolate. In a speyside ex-bourbon scotch this can mean peaches, pears, apple skin, orange zest, and melons. And different combinations of many other notes can exist for funky Campbeltown scotches, crazy Indian Amrut expressions, fruity Irish whiskeys, etc.
Depth of flavour, tasting many different things (even if you cant pinpoint what) on different sips, or when paired with a cigar or conplimentary snack.  Im a Canadian boy, and I love my Canadian whisky (Wisers 18 for a great pour, CC 12 just to get my glow, CR when mixed with Canada Dry) but once I delved into single malts, I understood what complexity is.  

Note: I know this is a US heavy sub, and I love good bourbon.  JD Single Barrel is my all time favourite.  Much love to the U-S-A!
Some perfumes might smell just like roses, while others might smell like roses, vanilla, and the ocean all at once. The second perfume is more complex because it has more scents mixed together.

So, complexity in whiskies (or perfumes) is like having more colors in your crayon box or more scents in your bottle. It gives you a richer experience.
Great question! While my written notes on whiskey tend to be somewhat sophisticated, I haven‚Äôt thought too much about it. My answer is this: Anything that is more than one discernible note on the palate, and that other note is not wood. 

Now what I look for is a little different. My preference or favorites tend to be for things with a chocolate maltiness or nuttiness with notes of cherry or raisin or apricot.
For me, I like a bit of a difference between the nose and palate, but not totally different.

On the palate, the taste that first hits the tongue, then changes mid palate, then additional once you swallow, and then more in the after taste.  If it's all the same or mostly the same, it's a simple taste.  If there are changes throughout.

For example: Nose is caramel, butterscotch and toffee

Palate: Front is sweet, dark fruit, brown sugar, toffee,  Mid is spicy - cinnamon, cloves, pepper, and graham cracker, back palate is oaky, coffee, tobacco.  Finish is spicy, then some berry or apple. 20 seconds the finish is still going with leather.

It changes as you go and it may change on the second or third sip from dark fruit, to apple/cherry/banana.
Often times one that evolves - from nosing to initial taste to finish a complex whiskey will give different nosing/tasting notes throughout the experience. A non complex whiskey will have the same note on nosing, taste, and finish.
Complexity to me is the perceivable and distinct presence of two or more complementary favorable elements in each of the key aspects of a tasting profile: nose, fermentation and alcohols, grain and sugars, and aging (barrel character).
If it smells like one single thing then tastes like that one thing as well, that's kinda the opposite of what we're hoping to achieve here.

strong red candied fruits, & some mint. This nose stays with you. Doesn't burn the nostrils but isn't a light weight either. 

Palate:
 dark delicious roasted chocolate and sweet sugared baked fruit. Very creamy and smooth. Goes down like butter.
The mid Palate is brown sugar. Lovely lovely baked brown sugar 

Finish: long consistent, no rapid drops to be found here. brown sugar. Toasted oak and cinnamon make there presence known. I get this citrus note that really ties the whole thing together. 

This is absolutely an amazing bourbon that needs to be shared with friends and at the most special events. The kind where you bring out the good stuff while grinning from ear to ear knowing that your friends are in for a ride.

MM BRT 02 
Nose: 
Those red fruits are here. Vanilla cake frosting, oak no astringency to be found. The Nose is safe from being burned and will Nose another day 

Palate: 

spice is nice and it's very nice here. Very sweet & spicy.  remember that creaminess I told you about earlier. It returns. Chocolate hazelnut is here in force. Mid Palate oak shows up. Not quite like licking a tree but it's there. These flavors that are presented here decided that they didnt really want to stick around at first but then what I thought was the end.. 

Finish: this freaking thing changed up on me. Baking spices, Cinnamon, and lovely decadent chocolate are here and they are unmistakable. 
Great mouth feel. Not super thick but creamy. It's fascinating the proof for this release is 54.7 vs CA 57.85. BRT drinks hotter to me then CA. This ain't no GTS level of hot but them cheeks got warm. THIS IS DELICIOUS and makers mark should be proud of this release. 
I know I am. 

MM CS B15-04
Nose: it's noses a  little bit hotter then the last two expressions. Not astringent but I definetly get maple syrup,  vanilla, and oak. It's an enjoyable nose. Reminds me of pancakes cooking on the grill while camping in a forest with a lot of trees 

Palate: 
very very interesting. This one starts out lovely. I'd say the nose transfers to the Palate well. I get some cherry and  brown sugar. I do a kentucky chew and this one starts to burn. 

Finish. It was a good ride but it's like the ride operator forgot he was supposed to stop the ride and then the ride crashed into a tree. Strong oak. Bitter. I'm going to use the word astringency here. No getting around it. It's not an enjoyable finish to me but I will say it's not easily forgettable. 
This one is hard to love. I like the dark cherry and brown sugar. Its a flavor bomb but I would have preferred to not taste tree with my pancakes. 

Ranking:
This was hard to choose and il be honest. I can tell there will be days when I choose BRT 02 over CA due to that delicious chocolate note. Its full flavor and the fact that it changed up to such an enjoyable experience mid Palate to finish. BRT 02 is just that good to me but today is not that day. 
I absolutely love the fact that CA drinks so smooth, so creamy, so enjoyable. So consistent thru the entire ride. Wow what an experience.

This is awesome to hear! I have a bottle of MM CS and prefer it over most Weller products, but I was only able to get my hands on BRT-01 & BRT-02 of the Wood Finishing Series. I'm on the hunt for MM CA here in Texas, but Spec's employees and TW employees don't have a clue about it. If you picked up that MM CA in a retail store, which state was it?
It's a good thing they don't know, man. If you miss it at Spec's or TW, try to grab it in small, independent chain stores before they mark it up. I went a little high to get mine at $250 last week - only bottle the store got. Fast forward to yesterday, they got another bottle and are now asking *$900*.
Wow! I‚Äôll definitely try that. I got a couple independent stores in my area that are reasonable with markups. In one, I stumbled across a bottle of Larceny C922 for $75.

I am surprised to see that stores are already receiving MM CA. I didn‚Äôt think the release was until later in September, and I also thought there‚Äôd be more bottles, especially coming from a distillery like Maker‚Äôs.
I heard Arizona got it first. Wonder what state OP is in

Tonight's Pour,"For tonight having a pour of this delicious 6 year Cask Strength Doc Swinson. This has a very classic bourbon taste and nose with the vanillas and brown sugar and a medium finish with the oak really shining at the end. Doesn't drink anywhere close to the proof point. This is truly a fantastic classic bourbon üëå 

(Not a pro reviewer or anything just an enthusiast posting my opinions)",Love that stuff. I have 2 different store picks of it. Delicious
Smoke Wagon Uncut OG vs Younger,"Have not officially reviewed any bottles but as an engineer, I saw an opportunity to runna side by side comparison and I took it. 

Grabbed a bottle of Uncut the Younger ($43) today to compare against an UCUF I picked up a few months ago for about $70, which is now $77 in my state. Ran a blind between the two and it was surprisingly difficult to tell the difference. Very similar nose and taste with only one bolder and slightly hotter than the other. Called that out as the younger and was surprisingly wrong. 

Conclusion? As first drinks of the night, both have great taste, oldie UCUF with a bit more flavor.. But if you're drinking it after/with a couple others, definitely save yourself the $34 and get the younger.",Younger.
Just picked up a bottle of Makers Mark BRT-02,"Heard great things about this stuff. I previously bought the FAE-01 and loved it, so I thought I'd try this one. And it's great. Found for $65, I think it's a good/normal deal? 

Sorry about the image quality!","Nice! Hope I come across one of these
It‚Äôs solid. My favorite of the Wood Finishes"
Review: Octomore 11.1,"The peat level in this Octomore edition is 139.6ppm, and it's brutal ‚Äì in fact, the strongest I've ever tasted. Even with all that peat bomb this bottle carries, you can still discover hints of fruits, almonds, and even subtle sweet notes. It's a complete experience. If you're a fan of smoky flavors, this is the elite choice.","Yaaaas.  A couple drops of water and you get a pest bomb with a sweat finish.  X.1s are my favorite whiskeys.
Very nice. What do you call that type of glass, it looks cool. Do you prefer it to the Glencairn?

Is the copita from glencairn and sometimes it‚Äôs way better"
Started my infinity bottle today.,"First taste is suprisingly good, i didn‚Äôt really have high expectations. It gets a bit taken over by the Nelson bros. Black Brier, but i pick up parts of different bottles on different parts of my tongue. Very excited to see what this becomes in the future. 

I would try to give you guys tasting notes, but i‚Äôm not expert yet. 

This graphic is made with the Infinity Bottle app for IOS.","Don‚Äôt expect taste-perfection as soon as you pour your spirits into the bottle.  Give it a few weeks for everything the meld together.  You‚Äôll be surprised at how different it is.

Wow I‚Äôd just drink most of those.  Mine would have been 50/50 old granddad114 rowans creek and it‚Äôs for cooking or baking recipes
What bottle are you using for the infinity bottle? I‚Äôve been wanting to start one but not sure what bottle I should repurpose for it
Started mine in June! Scared to try it üòÇ
Ha! Mine is 80% makers mark and 20% Buffalo trace right now and I really love it. Ha!
Mines up to 47... I find the longer you let it sit and the more you add, the better. Keep things in the same general category, like don't put Irish or Scotch in a mostly Bourbon l blend. I usually don't put ""higher shelf"" stuff in there that I mostly drink neat. Mine is more used for a conversation piece and for Old Fashioneds. 

If the taste gets weird, just add higher amounts of the stuff you really like.
This seems like a fun project I'd love to see the end through to!
What app is this?
Will do, i‚Äôll report back with updates.
I usually do just drink them neat, as is, in a glass, but i wanted to try the whole infinity bottle thing. I think putting the last oz or 2 of a bottle into the infinity makes me feel less guitly about finishing a bottle. Because some of these i probably won‚Äôt see again, so part of it can live on in the infinity. I just passed on an old grandad 114 a month ago, and seeing it posted a lot is making me want to go back and get it. I like the bonded.

Honestly, let this baby sit for a month before pouring‚Ä¶your patience will pay off!
I know I could, I guess I meant idk which one would look the coolest haha. Ideally if I could find an old fitz to drink that would be my first choice of bottle
Is there a way to share a picture on here? I‚Äôve added 12 different mostly mainly bourbon and some rye.
Sounds good, i‚Äôll try not to touch it too much. Even though it is tempting.
Oh i gotcha, old fitz is a pretty bottle. Aesthetically imo i enjoy Jack Single Barrels, Blanton‚Äôs, Willet Pot Still, Green River, Four Roses Singe Barrel, Larceny, Town Branch, lots of options. Adictivo tequila might be one if the coolest liquor bottles i‚Äôve seen.

Review #11: The Dalmore 12 Year,"Well, here we are. I‚Äôve seen this bottle become a commonplace for arguments between enthusiasts, and this seems to be a reoccurring issue in this hobby. The fact that it‚Äôs chill-filtered and contains added coloring seems to leave a sour preconception in a lot of minds. I‚Äôve read that it dilutes flavor in exchange for a much clearer liquid; however, I‚Äôve also seen others argue with links as proof that, in blind tastings, it‚Äôs not entirely recognizable for some. I will say, I‚Äôm not really a fan of the idea of added coloring aspect myself. However, after reading up some more on it, I‚Äôve ultimately come to one conclusion: just fucking drink what you like. Who gives a rat‚Äôs furry, plagued ass if other‚Äôs don‚Äôt like what you like? I wholeheartedly *loathe* the Double Day bourbon from Cooperstown Distillery that I reviewed and poured out recently, but others might find it enjoyable. Good for them! I feel like a snob, but not enough of one to shit on someone‚Äôs existence for disliking a bottle of whiskey. Sometimes you have to wade through things you don‚Äôt enjoy to find some that you do, and sometimes you‚Äôre pleasantly surprised. I‚Äôve had pours of this I‚Äôve enjoyed last year when I bought it, so now I‚Äôll come back to it after aging a bit and having more experience. 

Here‚Äôs the back of the box because I, astutely to those around me, am a lazy fuck.

‚ÄúA ROYAL HERITAGE. Bestowed in 1263 by the King of Scotland, the ‚ÄúRoyal‚Äù 12-point stag proudly adorns each bottle of The Dalmore, encapsulating the distillery‚Äôs regal legacy. 
THE ART OF THE DALMORE. For over 150 years, The Dalmore has set the standard in multi cask maturation. Carefully composed spirit and hand selected casks, from the world‚Äôs finest bodegas and wineries, are expertly curated to create a sumptuous and layered whiskey of legendary finesse. 
AGED 12 YEARS. An outstanding single malt matured in American white oak ex-bourbon casks and finessed in rare and aged oloroso sherry casks.‚Äù

Holy *shit* that was expositional and a bit vain. Gotta advertise your product, I guess. Let‚Äôs dig in and revisit.  

Distillery: Dalmore Distillery

Type & Region: Scotch in Highland region 

Alcohol: 40% (80 proof)

Aged: 12 years. It spends the first 9 years in the ex-bourbon barrels, then half are transferred to the oloroso sherry casks before being mixed together in the bottling stage. 

Nose: juicy raisins, baker‚Äôs chocolate, dried fruits like apricots and plums, the sherry works pretty well in this. Very dessert-like. Vanilla beans and chocolate orange peels. Those raisins are very adamant on swirling. 

Taste: first taste is more of the chocolate notes that I was getting from the nose and some of that sherry fruitiness. Some toffee , honey, and mild cinnamon. Finish has some bourbon barrel oakiness and no burn at all. The mouthfeel is different than what I thought it would when I bought it: it coats but more thinly than I‚Äôd expect and not for very long. Disappointing. But that also comes from the 40% ABV, I suspect. 

God I wish this tastes as good as it smells. It smells great; I would buy a candle of this scent. The taste is‚Ä¶*fine* but it‚Äôs not as strong as I was hoping. It doesn‚Äôt linger in the mouth as long as something that cost me $55 should. And I felt like I got that at a decent price at the time of purchasing. I saw that it goes for like $65 MSRP, and that‚Äôs absurd. If this were $35-40, I‚Äôd feel a little bit better about it; alas, it‚Äôs not and I don‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs too thin and the flavors aren‚Äôt as impactful as they should be. Maybe the next scotch I try in sherry casks will taste a bit better. And less full of itself. 

Score: 78. Eh, still drinkable but not in any hurry to get another. 

Grading Scale:  (courtesy of u/Letter10 thanks again)  
96-100: Outstanding pour, will buy another bottle asap. Perfect    
90-95: Damn good pour, I'm smitten    
85-89: A very good Pour, will definitely grab another when its empty    
80-84: Pretty solid pour, everyday drinker depending on value    
75-79: Eh, still drinkable but not in any hurry to get another    
70-74: Share it with friends who pretend to like whiskey    
65-69: Not worth the money in my opinion    
64 and below: probably not going to finish this stuff","I like Dalmore 12, its fine.  But if you want to get into Sherry there are some better sherry bombs.
Your writing is awesome. Keep these reviews coming.
I was given this bottle and initially did not love it , so I decided to blend it with Woodinville sherry finished bourbon. Wow what a great pour. When I am given a meh bottle I can usually work with it. I poured it for 8 friends they all loved it. Win win
As long as your favorite whiskey isn't Mellow Corn, I don't judge at all!

Also Dalmore's always smell great but the palate leaves me hanging, I wish they were pushed up to 46% ABV
I‚Äôm sure there are. I‚Äôm not very well-versed in the world of scotch, so what would you recommend?
Thank you! I feel like I allow myself to rant incessantly sometimes, but I appreciate that!
Agreed! I think it would open up the flavors exponentially."
Review #10: Cooperstown Doubleday Bourbon (featuring my girlfriend playing Dead Space and our kitchen sink),"Hello. I‚Äôm regretting this already but here I am with the consequences of my actions. I acquired this bottle also as a gift (not to brag, but I love my family) and have gotten through a lot of it since then. It‚Äôs not, er, particularly something I enjoy. I actually had my girlfriend‚Äôs aunt and uncle try it, and they were pretty‚Ä¶animated about how much they hated it. One of them went to their RV to grab a soda to wash the taste out with sugar and carbonation. So I think it‚Äôs safe to say that they did not enjoy this. I figured I‚Äôd give it a try and review it to the small group that might laugh at my expense. If it tastes better than I remember, then I‚Äôll eat my words.

My girlfriend started Dead Space a couple of weeks ago. She‚Äôs definitely not a gamer,  but as a result of us living together she‚Äôs become more introduced to this hobby of mine. She abhors whiskey, so I highly doubt I‚Äôll be able to get her into this. She beat her very first full fledge game a month ago, and that was New Super Lucky‚Äôs Tale. I definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to start getting into games; platformers that are on the lenient side in general are fantastic starting points. So, what did I do after she beat it? I had her start the original fucking Dead Space on normal. Cause I‚Äôm an asshole. Don‚Äôt even need an AITA for that one, I‚Äôm definitely the asshole. She has, to my adamant surprise, taken this in stride. She‚Äôs on chapter 3 now, and might even get to chapter 4 at the time of posting this. I‚Äôm sure she wants to punch me in the dick though, and it‚Äôs probably deserved. 

I‚Äôm a lazy fuck, so here‚Äôs the description of this bottle on Cooperstown Distillery‚Äôs website: ‚ÄúA blend of young and older, more complex bourbons, it drinks remarkably well, like a fine ‚Äúolder‚Äù bourbon should. Filled in our patented, specialty baseball decanter, this bourbon makes a great sipping spirit.‚Äù We‚Äôll see about that, won‚Äôt we? 

Distillery: Cooperstown Distillery 

Type & Region: Bourbon, New York, USA

Alcohol: 45% (90 proof)

Composition: I do not know, nor could I find, the percentages of corn, rye, and barley. 

Aged: NAS, my guess is pretty young. From what I‚Äôve found, it‚Äôs a mix of young and 5 year old bourbons that are aged for 10 months. 

Nose: corn heavy as fuck, indicative of the youth. Slight char, vanilla, kind of astringent. It smells and burns the nostrils like nail polish remover. Grainy. Not great. 

Taste: corn, vanilla, some pepper, the lightest caramel and plastic. It‚Äôs got some spice but not in an enjoyable way since it‚Äôs tastes like shit. Chewing unlocks more of the heat and the finish has some oakiness. The entire duration of this tasting has that gross, overpowering nail polish remover astringency that‚Äôs hot even for the tongue. I don‚Äôt know if I manage to just have a bad bottle of the stuff or if it‚Äôs all like this. I sincerely hope the former. Why the fuck is it salty as well? Now I‚Äôm salty. 

Fuck this bourbon. It‚Äôs gross. It‚Äôs astringent. I also made myself an old fashioned with better bourbon in it after, so I‚Äôm recuperating. The bottle is definitely cool as fuck though, and I will keep it. I visited the actual baseball hall of fame with my father years ago, and it‚Äôs one of my favorite memories. The bourbon obviously doesn‚Äôt do anything to discredit the memory or ruin the hall of fame; I do think that maybe the distillery should quit distilling this spirit entirely. I‚Äôll let you know if my drain spits it back up at me. 

Score: 30. DEFINITELY not going to finish this stuff.

64 and below: probably not going to finish this stuff","Ive got some ECBP in my glass and playing the new Texas Chain Saw Massacre game.
That whiskey sounds awful.. After the dead space remake I went back to RE2 and have RE3 on deck. I love killing zombies (and monsters), in the dark, surround sound, and a nice glass of whiskey.
Those gimmicky bottles are almost never good. Thank you for taking one for the team and proving that theory right.
Dead Space remake was sick!
I‚Äôve been to Cooperstown distillery‚Äôs bar down the street from the baseball HOF a few times. That‚Äôs probably the worst product they make, people just buy it because of the bottle. I have a rye from them that‚Äôs pretty good.
I agree it‚Äôs bad. The last restaurant I ran was in Cooperstown so a friend there sent me some. I too am now in Florida.
I‚Äôve had an unopened bottle in my collection and gave it to my son.
Pop it in the freezer, drink it super cold or use it as a mixer for some whiskey sours.
How are both of those? I‚Äôve had ECBP on my radar as one of my potential next bottle purchases and I‚Äôve thought about playing that with a few of my buds.
You would be correct lol. 

I haven‚Äôt played the remake, this is the original that‚Äôs on Games Pass. I‚Äôve heard nothing but good things though so at some point in the future I‚Äôll play it. Still have a shit ton on the backlog though. 

I haven‚Äôt played RE3 yet but I ADORE RE2. That game is fantastic. Cheers to that, mate!
Doing my due diligence ü´° all jokes aside, I think it actually helps me appreciate the good bottles even more when I find one that‚Äôs not as good in between.
I‚Äôve heard it is! I‚Äôve yet to pick it up due to the honestly absurd backlog I have, so I‚Äôm gonna work through some of that before buying anything else new. It‚Äôs on my list of potential pickups though!
After tasting it, I definitely believe you about it being the worst product they distill lol. I don‚Äôt think the rye is available locally for me since I‚Äôm in SW Florida.
My father‚Äôs not into whiskey but we both love baseball. I don‚Äôt have the heart to tell him.
Can in fact confirm that I did none of those things, and that I fed it to my sink.
Well I highly recommend both. Get any ECBP you can find in your area. If you live in a state where they are hard to come by, consider paying up to $100 on secondary. As for the game, you and some buddies will have a great time. Super immersive creepy stealth stuff. If you are a fan of the movie, they did a get job recreating the despair, sounds, and feel of that movie.
That‚Äôs why I gave it to him. It didn‚Äôt look right on the shelf with the rest of the collection.
I will definitely look around. I try not to pay secondary for anything if I can help it, there‚Äôs always other new bottles I can grab instead while I continue searching. I do understand why people pay for it though, especially if it something they enjoy so much. 

I‚Äôm not a giant horror fan of movies normally but I tend to enjoy games a lot more. I‚Äôll definitely try to see if my friends want to give it a shot with me, thanks for the recommendations!"
Benchmark single barrel review,"This is a very under appreciated line in my opinion. 

Nose- cherry, vanilla, a fresh sweet note I a can't nail down.

Palate - same as the nose come across clear and has a sweetness that isn't over bearing.

Finish- medium finish with a lingering sweet after taste. Nothing off-putting, slight alcohol burn. 
 
Summary- At 95 proof it isn't overwhelming, I have found my preference sits around 100 proof. This is a solid bourbon. Not anything unique or special but a solid choice. I found this in GA, price was $10 -24.

Side note when I found it for $10 I grabbed one not planning on replacing this bottle. For $10 you can't go wrong .... at $24.... there are better options like four roses yellow label, old forester 100 proof. Etc.",Good stuff for the money!
"PBR ""Whiskey"" review - as promised","Nose- surprise notes of peach maybe plumb?
It has alot of sweet corn and fruit but reminiscent of everclear. 

Palate- the peach comes across with a corn flavor behind it.

Finish- short smoother than I expected. That being said it is 80 proof with a short finish. 

Summary- I am weary of drinking more than I poured(see pictures). Ultimately it is not bad but as a bourbon drinker this is never going to be a go to. I am interested in trying to age this somehow. As a curiosity,  I would give it a 4/10. I put some in some lemonade and it tasted like a hard seltzer type drink with strange after taste and all. Do with that what you will. 

Would I buy this again? No I don't think I will have to. I am going to bring it to my tasting club. But that will probably be the last it is used for anything. 

Cool packaging, but I could see getting a headache from drinking this.","Thanks for sharing. Didn't really expect a high score for it, but a fun bottle for the bar!
Strange. Their beer is so high end.
Get an oak spiral or stick and let it sit for a few months. I did this with some Penderyn ""new make"" (that I was later told was their British Baijiu - a one-off AFAIK) split in two smaller bottles with mizunara and white oak respectively. The end product was much tastier and a great way to learn about the woods I used.
Grab a set of these and see what happens. I have a bottle of local "" whiskey "" that is made in a vat with spirals. Its SUPER young, so I tossed one of these in for a half year, then changed it out. Its coming up on a year now, and its quite a bit darker.

Use it to clean your glenns"
Sherry casks,"I‚Äôve noticed of the two bottles of scotch I have bought so far (Tamnavukin sherry cask and Glenfiddisch) both had this nutty, dark chocolaty taste which I very much did not enjoy. I noticed both were in sherry casks at some point. I thought this was the reason but a Google search said that sherry casks usually gives sweetness which really confused me. 

So could I be wrong? What notes do you usually get from sherry casks? Could I just chosen to whiskeys with notes i didn‚Äôt like?

Would be gutted if I didn‚Äôt like sherry casks as so much beloved whiskey use them.","Others may disagree with me, but you usually get more darker fruits, such as blackberry jam, plums, cherries, etc., but it does come with a bit of chocolate-like taste afterwards in the palate or even finish.

I will say, though, before you give up on sherry casks, try ones that actually use the sherry cask better, such as GlenAllachie, Arran, Aberlour, Glengoyne, Edradour, Balvenie, etc. 

The ones you mentioned, Glenfiddich and Tamnavulin, are both good in mixers or just casual sipping for people who just enjoy any type of scotch, they don't really get the sherry-flavor out at all, and I don't like either brands when I want a sherried whiskey, plus there's better bottles out there for those prices.
Not all sherry is the same as well. Oloroso and PX are the two most commonly used for whisky finishes, and they are radically different wines. Oloroso is dry, nutty, and fruity but without the sweetness. PX is syrupy, rich, and very sweet. Whiskies finished in PX to me get a lighter fruitiness and sweetness, and oloroso more of the dark fruitiness and even nuttiness you were describing.
>both had this nutty, dark chocolaty taste which I very much did not enjoy. I noticed both were in sherry casks at some point. I thought this was the reason but a Google search said that sherry casks usually gives sweetness

Nutty and chocolatey flavors both often come from the use in whisky maturation of casks that have been seasoned with sherry. In my experience those flavors are more likely to show up when the casks were seasoned with Oloroso sherry (which is probably the most common type used to prepare casks for maturing whisky) and which tends to be nutty in flavor. Cask seasoned with the sweeter PX (Pedro Xim√©nez) sherry tend to be sweeter, and casks seasoned with one of the biologically aged sherries (Fino, etc.) tend to be less chocolatey, but also less sweet - instead they tend to be more salty.

This IMHO is a good guide to the variety of sherries: https://www.sherrynotes.com/sherry-wine-types/

The diversity of such notes added to a maturing whisky by casks prepared using different sherries may explain the source of your confusion.

Additionally, some but not all sherry casks are made of European oak (mostly *Quercus robur*) which tends to be more spicy and tannic in the flavors it imparts to a whisky, than the American oak (*Quercus alba*) which is used to make the majority of sherry casks and almost all ex-bourbon casks. 

Casks made from European oak are more expensive and so whiskies which used that for their maturation will typically tell you so explicitly, as a sign of luxury and to help justify their price - this does not mean that one oak type is inherently better than the other, it depends on your personal tastes. If you do not like dark chocolate notes in a whisky then European oak is probably a more risky option.

And lastly, a first fill sherry cask (one not previously used to mature whisky) will impart a stronger set of flavors to a whisky than will a refill cask (a cask already previously used at least once, and in some cases several times, for maturing whiskies).

For anyone reading who wants to know more about the topic, I rec the following 3 articles as good places to start:

Cheers!
Alright sounds good, been really excited to try Aberlour and Glenalleachie. 

What are some whiskeys at the same price point of Glenfiddisch and Tamnavulin that are better?
Thanks a lot for the information!
If you want zero sherry casks I‚Äôd look at Glenmorangie Orignal. All ex-bourbon casks, so it has a nice straightforward profile without being boring.
The Glengoyne 10 can be found for around $32 depending on where you live in the states and the 12 can usually be found for $48-$50 which.

The Aberlour 12 can be found for around $52-$55 which is extremely reasonable for what it offers!

In good faith, I cannot recommend Macallan due to its high price point ($80 for a 12 sherry is insane for the quality it is)!
Yes, the Glen Grant and Glenlivets are also both great as well, where they mostly use ex-bourbon casks as well! You get a lot more malt and the vanilla palate that I always love!
Thanks, in Sweden Glengoyne 10 not available"
