Macduff 2011 Aged 9 Years Single Cask Bottling First Fill Sherry Hogshead 65.4%vol,"A really lovely, well priced (¬£48) full sherry dream from a forgotten bottler. 

Nose - Hairspray, Damson jam, porridge, cinnamon, old oak, cherry pipe tobacco

Taste - Super oily, to much spice at cask strength but performs well diluted down to about 48%. The usual sherry notes but with sea salt also. A lovely oaky hum to it. Hazelnut also with waiter 

Finish- Coffee galore, a really lovely drop!",
Glenfiddich Perpetual Collection,"Finally, I got around to tasting the 4 Glenfiddich Perpetual Collection range, from VAT 1 to VAT 4. A good friend came over, and we reviewed it together. These whiskys are matured in American bourbon oak cask, some European oak, some red wine casks, and also some in the oloroso sherry cask. They are then finished in the separate solera vat that's never been emptied but constantly topped up, thus called the perpetual. I saw these 4 huge solera vats in Glenfiddich's main warehouse. I was intrigued by it, and that motivated me to hunt down these 4 whiskys. Now, the summary of what I think of each:

VAT 1: NAS, 40% ABV.  Nose, very sweet floral fragrance. Palate, it's spicy peppery, citric fruits. Medium finish.

VAT 2: NAS, 43% ABV. Nose, caramel sweetness, musky. Palate, I got a nice sherry flavour, very smooth, not spicy. Some malty flavour. Nice longer finish. Quality whisky for a NAS.

VAT 3: 15 yo, 50.2% ABV,  NCF. Nose, oaky notes. Palate, I got peppery spices,  sherry sweetness, and a slight burn of alcohol on the throat. Complex layers. Long finish.

VAT 4: 18 yo, 47.8% ABV,  NCF. Nose, very nice floral scent, almost like perfume. Palate, very smooth and mild oaky sweetness, apples and peaches, has depth of flavours. Nice long finish. This is a quality dram. Punches above its price. 

Overall, my favourite is clear. 
#1: VAT 4, a high-quality whisky. I love this bottle. I will buy more of this.
#2: VAT 2, very good quality whisky that's affordable. 
#3: VAT 3, a bit rough at the edges, mellowed with a few drops of water. 
#4: VAT 1, a bit young and lacks character. Nothing stands out. Still, it's a good drinking whisky on its own.

Slanite!! ü•Éü•Éü•Éü•É",
A Good sherry dram,"I bought this bottle of Fettercairn 12 yo PX cask at the Edinburgh Airport duty-free in Aug this year. The PX finish caught my attention, as I'm  a sherry fan. The base 12 yo is 100% ex-Bourbon. However, this one is matured 10 years in ex-Bourbon, and the final 2 years finished in Pedro Ximenez cask. Bottled at 40% ABV. On the nose, some sweet citric orange aroma. Nice color, oily looking, but light tails. On the palate, distinctive sherry flavor, peppery spice, nutty notes. Touch of chocolate and berries. A nice warm medium finish. Not a complex dram, I actually had higher expectations. Strong PX sherry taste saved it, had just the right amount of sweetness. It's a good drinking whisky. But there are better options at that price point. Slainte!!",
Got some good scores hunting on a Monday.,"Got really lucky with the Kilkerran, store owner said he only got two bottles of the 16, and that was the last. 
The Ardnamurchan and Dovetail are readily available. 

Quick hit, neck pour tasting notes: 
The Ardnamurchan is very Talisker esque, sea brine, smoke, underlying subtle sweetness carries through the tasting experience. Very much to my liking, this along with Campbelltown whisky is the ‚Äúflavor profile‚Äù I enjoy most in whisky.

The Kilkerran is very predictable for a standard offering for the label, it has all the classic notes, but in wonderful balance, and slightly mellower. I‚Äôm sure the bottle will open up to wonderful complexity as I drink through it, was very excited to get this bottle. Imho Kilkerran is easily one of the best whiskies on the planet, and an unbelievable value, considering ppl pay exorbitant prices for Springbank, and I would argue Kilkerran is a better whisky, and is to our great fortune, cheaper.

The Dovetail is incredible, notably very viscous mouthfeel, waves of thick syrupy sweetness, with a heavy vanilla/caramel presence up front, with red fruit tinge in the background, mildly tart, and barrel funk on the finish.  It‚Äôs a very complex almost punch in the mouth, but with thick syrup of delectably sweet flavors. Like a desert whisky. Really extraordinary stuff.","Kilkerran was a hunt but are Dovetail and Ardnamurchan a hunt in your area?
I agree wholeheartedly about Kilkerran. The cost to quality ratio favours it hugely compared to Springbank. I've got a bottle of the 16 yet to open, and a few of the Peat in Progress bottles on the go, which are amazing. Congrats on the haul. Enjoy.
I happened across a bottle of Kilkerran 16 the day after New Year's. Just popped in to see what was still left on the shelves, and it was just sitting there... hadn't even been priced yet. The guy ringing me out gave me a funny look because I bought that, and a bottle of Mellow Corn.ü§£
Nice find, this batch of the Kilkerran 16 is really great with an interesting cask makeup of 60% (obviously 2nd or 3rd fill) sherry, 35% bourbon & 5% rum. I really like the oily mouthfeel. After having enjoyed a few drams, I let it oxidize a bit and will come back to this gem when the weather gets a bit warmer. I feel that it will be a very nice light, complex and slightly dirty springtime dram. The rum influence gives a slight tropical touch, very nice. Not the kind of whisky to rush and share at a party.

I don‚Äôt think it is better than Springbank and the prices shouldn‚Äôt be that different. The thing is SB10 is as good as KK16, I made a side by side to check that out and it is a tie, both superb. Now SB10 should be around 35 bucks cheaper than the KK16 and they are priced around the same in my market (I can find SB10 10 bucks cheaper than KK16) . I don‚Äôt think any malt can reproduce what Springbank is doing with their 2.5 half time distilled stuff. Kilkerran is more cereal heavy, less fruity distillate than Springbank. I love both, Kilkerran is more dirty and Springbank more elegant. Springbank has everything that Kilkerran has, the contrary cannot be said. But regarding availability and price, those Kilkerrans are a gift to us lovers of oldschool lightly peated beauties.
I live in the ATL suburbs, and Kilkerran isn‚Äôt rare, but I haven‚Äôt seen the 16 before. Dovetail I have seen before, just not very often. Ardnamurchan I wasn‚Äôt even aware was a whisky until a few weeks ago, and the reviews of the flavor profile caught my ear and I thought I‚Äôd pick it up if I saw it. Sadly he was sold out of the cask strength offering, but for ~$60 it‚Äôs a fine deal. The box doesn‚Äôt jump off the shelf so it might‚Äôve been there longer and me not seen it.
Thanks man!
No doubt! I appreciate the feedback. üëçüèº
I‚Äôm in a suburb north of Houston, I shop nearby and in downtown, I‚Äôve been lucky to be at the right time in the Specs downtown which is similar to Total Wine or World of Beverages in ATL to get Kilkerran, which is as rare as Springbank. Dovetail is available year round and has been for quite sometime in both Total Wines and Specs. Ardnamurchan started to show up around July last year, it‚Äôs a hit and a miss from store to store. I have the regular AD version for $59 and it has a quite interesting profile to say the least. Definitely a good bargain for what you get in the bottle.
Total wine here has a fairly pedestrian on shelf selection, I had to go to a dozen stores to find the one I frequent now. Even then (because ATL seems to lean towards bourbon) Kilkerran gets passed up. I‚Äôve been able to get a lot of their most coveted releases, nearly all of the heavily peated batches, and the 8 yr cask strength sherried offering- just calling my name from shelves. Even the store owner was chatting with me about how 60% of his customer base is exclusively bourbon drinkers, and 40% of them are brand new and only buy allocated buffalo trace products. Which is wild bc he has a very good bourbon selection on his shelves.
Yo I live in ATL as well and I went to Tower on Buford a few weeks ago and they had some great stuff. I live close to the Total wine on Barrett but they have everything I can get anywhere most of the time. Minks on Delk has a great brown liquor selection.

I've been to a LOT of stores looking for things I haven't tried.
Yeah the total wine on Barrett will have Yam 12 over the holidays, and if you order online in time they will have allocated bottles and limited releases that you can pickup, but that‚Äôs a hassle. Minks is great, similar pricing to total wine with better selection, and I always prefer to help a small business. I tried every little mom and pop shop that are just run of the mill liquor stores. But the little shop I go to now has stuff on the shelf you simply would never see at either location. The current line of Octomore is sitting on his shelves, he has a whole section of Barrel products, private barrels and store picks galore. He has the entire Compass box lineup,(all 3 Myths and Legends, I mean I found No Name 1 there last year when I first found the place) a whole shelf of Signatory Vintage cask strength releases‚Ä¶ and Every big distillery and a ton I had to look up. If you‚Äôre in the scotch section he‚Äôll come out and talk to you, super nice guy. I mean as disciplined as I try to be, I‚Äôve never walked out with less than three bottles. Fortunately for me, a significant portion of his customer base are new taters who only buy allocated Buffalo trace releases, and leave the gems on the shelves."
Review #1: Kavalan Solist Moscatel Finish,"Review #1 Kavalan Solist Moscatel Finish

Hi all, long-time lurker and this is my first review post.

Happy holidays, r/whisky!

I‚Äôve had a variety of scotch, bourbon and whiskey and this is the first bottle that has compelled me to try my hand at a review. 

What I‚Äôve tried: 

Scotch:
- Bunnahabin 12
- Glenfiddich 12
- Glenlivet 12
- Oban 12
- Tomatin 12 / 14 / 18
- Johnnie Walker Black

Japanese Whiskey:
- Hibiki Harmony
- Takeretsu Single Malt
- Nikka From the Barrel
- Nikka Yoichi
- Suntory Ao

Taiwan Whiskey:
- Kavalan Solist Moscatel Finish

Bourbon:
- Buffalo Trace
- Eagle Rare
- Woodford Reserve Double Oaked
- Michter‚Äôs Small Batch

Irish:
- Sexton Single Malt

Cracked this open to celebrate both Christmas and my dad‚Äôs birthday. Shared with my dad & brother. Comes in a beautiful wood display box.  

Kavalan Solist Moscatel Finish Single Cask Strength. Taiwan single malt. 56.3% ABV. No colour added, Non-chill filtered.

Price paid: $7,800 NTD (approx $333 CAD / 252 USD)

Maturation: No age statement. Matured in Spanish Moscatel Sherry cask.

Served: Neat, in a glencairn.

Nose: Drizzled honey, white grape, jammy fruits, floral, touch of toffee & chocolate. I could nose this forever.

Palate: The nose transitions very well to the palate. Silky smooth & slightly creamy texture. The drizzled honey becomes honey castella (more condensed) while the other notes of white grape, jammy fruits, floral, touch of toffee & chocolate transition over.

Finish: Medium-long. The honey darkens and becomes more like brown sugar. The floral & jammy fruits remain but are lighter and transition into a heavier chocolate note.

Comments: This is amazing. I‚Äôll be honest - most scotch/bourbon/whiskey that I‚Äôve had, I can nose/taste 2-3 notes at most. With this, there is an absolute explosion of flavours that meld fantastically. Well-balanced. A dessert whiskey on the sweeter side. 

Final score: 94

Rating Scale:

0-49: Blech. ()

50-59: Save it for mixing. (Crown Royale)

60-69: Not so good. I might not turn down a glass if I needed a drink. (Michter‚Äôs Small Batch)

70-74: Meh. It‚Äôs definitely drinkable, but it can do better. (Buffalo Trace, Eagle Rare, Sexton Single Malt, Tomatin 12, Suntory Ao)

75-79: Decent whisky worth tasting. Happy I tried it but wouldn‚Äôt pick up a 2nd bottle. (Johnnie Walker Black, Tomatin 14, Nikka Yoichi, Nikka From the Barrel, Glenlivet 12, Glenfiddich 12)

80-84: Quite good. Quality stuff. I‚Äôd consider buying a 2nd bottle at MRSP. (Bunnahabin 12, Oban 12, Hibiki Harmony, Takeretsu Single Malt, Woodford Reserve Double Oaked)

85-89: Excellent, a standout dram. Would definitely buy at MRSP if I can. (Tomatin 18)

90-94: Sublime, a personal favourite in its category. (Kavalan Solist Moscatel Finish)

95-100: As good as it gets. Jaw-dropping, eye-widening, unforgettable whisky. ()

My rating scale is based purely on flavour experience, and does not take value-for-money into account. Cheers!","Cask strength Kavalan almost never fails to impress. Great review thank you - I‚Äôm yet to try this expression!
Great review! I brought this one home as well. Very happy with my decision. Happy holidays"
There is no way they smelt and tasted all that!,"The nose

*""immediately hit with a whiff of salty, briny, minerality. Then comes the smell of campfire ash, like waking up the morning after burning a campfire only to find it still smoldering. There are earthy tones throw in as well. But as the whisky sits in the glass and opens up, more of the sweetness arrives, with notes of rosewater, honeysuckle, and sweet herbs""*

The palate

*""There is seaweed, salt, and minerality present but is quickly washed away by notes of honey and light orchard fruits. Freshly baked bread and sweet cereal malt also show up""*

So, I bought my first bottle of Talisker 10 (I've been a whisky drinker for over a decade, but for some reason never baught a bottle of Talisker 10, maybe I thought the cheaper price tag would mean not as good, but how wrong I was!)
And I love it.

Had a quick look online to see what others thought and I come across the review above. Now, this isnt the first time I've read this type of thing, obviously, but I attempted to smell what this man has described, and you know what I was able to smell? ...... peaty whisky.

That's it. It smelt like whisky and it tasted like whisky.

I think its very poetic and it creates a nice culture around this liquid gold, but honestly I dont believe anyone has ever smelt any of that stuff. Yes, you can smell the peaty smoke, you can smell the sweet notes, but there is no way the smell is anywhere near as specific as that description, just no way.

Is there?","All I'll say is that anyone can become better at tasting stuff with practice.

I think there are 2 main things that go into tasting.

1. You need to have already tasted and smelled a bunch of stuff, and I don't just mean whiskey. You can't say something has notes of lychee without having tried lychee. Also, no whiskey is going to taste as ""lychee"" as lychee itself, but after trying a bunch of whiskies, you might one day realize that a particular whiskey tastes more like lychee than almost any other whiskey you've tasted.

2. Being able to write well. My first tasting notes aren't super descriptive. It smells like caramel, tastes like caramel and it's good. That's not very helpful for a reader. I needed time to practice not just tasting, but also writing.
It depends on your experience and training. 

For example, I used to work as an expert taster for a major international food conglomerate. We were trained to pick out and differentiate between four different types of vanilla within a product. 

We also could differentiate types of malt, the balance between types of sugars and sweeteners etc. It was all pretty detailed. A lot of the time it comes down to different esters that are present and how our brains associate them with particular instances where they occur naturally.
Everyone has their own ""descriptors"", based on your experience, tasting of different stuff, foods, spices etcetera.

That's the game everyone tends to do, both at the nose and at the palate.

This said, that a review is often ""boasted"" or a bit more fictionalised with some extra descriptors is certainly true.

Just don't read SMWS notes of their bottlings then.. or do if you want to laugh xD
I‚Äôve been part of a scotch tasting community for the better part of two years. A few observations: your taste is really depending on your experience. In the beginning I couldn‚Äôt taste much difference between whiskeys, except for the smoke/peat/salt. Since days are clearer than others. What I‚Äôve had to eat/drink that day can really affect how clear or muted those flavors and scents can be detected. If I‚Äôm slightly congested, everything is muted. Going back to taste/experience, one tasting had an American whiskey line up (just for fun), and one bottle smelled like corona beer, when I tasted it, to me it had a strong corona flavor. Turns out the whiskey was made with barley. Just keep trying to pick out what you taste and write it down. Eventually you‚Äôll be surprised that your tasting notes are similar to someone else‚Äôs.
This is a skill one can learn. It's also quite personal - what I describe does not necessarily smell the same to you.

Here's a kit for training exactly this, for example: [https://www.lenez.com/en/kits/spirits/nez-du-whisky](https://www.lenez.com/en/kits/spirits/nez-du-whisky)

It's also obviously very easy to bullshit one's way to reviews that sound nice (or pretentious), and marketing gets silly more often than not. Take everything with a grain of salt and try for yourself. It's fine to disregard the reviews you find cringey.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt hit a baseball going 100 MPH so obviously no one can.‚Äù

I‚Äôve run a whiskey club for years. We do blind tastings every month. When I started it, most were novices at best. Many would simply stick with ‚Äúgood, bad, smooth, alcohol‚Äù, some would add ‚Äúsweet, smoky, fruit, wood‚Äù. They couldn‚Äôt pick up much past that. Through time, they started to recognize flavors they‚Äôd recognized before. Then they became more conscious in life when eating or smelling other things. They started to genuinely pick up nuance. Now, many of those same people can accurately throw out far more complex notes. Plus, tastings are inherently subjective - influenced by your state of mind and what you last ate. So variance is normal. And, to be fair, some are far more astute at it than others in the group. It‚Äôs a skill like anything else. We make the blinds a competition and some guys just never quite get it (although enjoy themselves regardless) and some guys are very good. There are two members in particular who, along with me, are far more capable at picking up lots of intricate details in the nose and palate. Meanwhile there are a couple of guys who just don‚Äôt get it no matter many rounds they try. They get a kick hearing everyone else describe things and they enjoy following along. And then there are the twenty or so in the middle who have steadily improved through the years. 

Point is: honing your sense is a skill; practice can improve this skill, but some are inherently better than others.
Another one of these posts?

You absolutely can. It is just as, if not more, prevalent in wine.

There is scientific evidence for how and why you can as well. It's been taught and practiced for decades at least, and you can go take a course, practice the skill, and improve it like any other. 

If you don't want to drink and appreciate whisky that way, no big deal. Many people just drink it and enjoy the most obvious flavours. 

But you absolutely can pick out nuances within them with practice.
You can get the salty taste in talisker 10

I really like the salty smokey flavors.
I‚Äôve been doing whisky tasting for over a decade and I really don‚Äôt care about descriptions like that. I know it‚Äôs a skill you can learn but I just decided to not bother. We do free associations when we try whiskies in our club so it can go like: it tastes like rubber boots on a rainy autumn day, or, Like licking a telephone pole whilst snorting salty licorice. Accurate? No, but funny.
I'd say its matter of training yourself, and finding ways to quantify differences. 

Take Laphroaig 10 and Kilkerran Heavily Peated 8 year, side by side. They are very smokey whiskys, but they have very different characteristics. Take Laphroaig 10 and Glengoyne 10, and you'll have an extreme difference in taste and smell. Clynelish was noted for a ""waxy"" overtone for a long time. 

I would also ask: how are you drinking your Scotch? Are you taking time to smell it? What do you drink it out of? Are you adding any water? Are you letting it sit before tasting?

I'll say that the last time I had Talisker 10, I got a very saline note, combined with pepper. There are absolutely times where I have tried a scotch, looked at another reviewer's notes, and mentally crossed off half of that they experienced. Sometimes, it's possible one might even be having a sense-memory, triggered off of another flavor or scent.

I know this is a bit of a ramble, but I suppose it's a gentle disagreement. It's perfectly ok that your experience doesn't line up with what others experience, but it also doesn't negate theirs.
Yes you can. With a lot of tastings and practice, you too can smelt and taste all that. Cheers !
I‚Äôve been enjoying single malts for nearly 30 years, trying all types from Islays to Speysides. I can honestly state that I‚Äôve never once experienced a salty/briny flavour on the palate.
If you think that sounds OTT you should read some of the tasting notes from the panel at the Scotch Malt Whisky Society.

I love it though. I can‚Äôt come up with anything half as poetic as that with my own dull taste buds but it really helps pick a dram when you‚Äôve got such a selection.
I know it takes practice and training to pick out different notes and that some people are excellent at it. But, there is a lot of guff involved in tasting notes. As someone that has been involved in amateur poetry for many years, I can safely tell you that there's a whole lot of amateur poetry in the whisky world.

In poetry, you can tell when there's a disconnect between the sentiment and the diction. Much like you can tell when there's a disconnect between the flavours of a whisky and the tasting notes. It's a lot of 'flowery language' -- a deliberate attempt by an author to use language that gives them a facade of sophistication. As opposed to concise language, that effectively conveys a point. 

Talisker 10 is briney, though. 

Have you also tried Torabhaig?
My old boss once used the description ""like a 1960s tenement close in Greeock"" I knew he meant a sort of disinfectant/smokey aroma but given that I have never been to greenock nor the 1960s it was a bit of a struggle!
I beg to differ, I am one of those people that can smell and taste like that. Maybe not as good as smelling campfire ash on the morning after smothering a fire, but I can definitely smell and taste the scriptures that nuanced it‚Äôs all about practice.
For me, lists of flavour notes get a bit tiresome, because they don't communicate the \*experience\* or \*character\* of the spirit. Which will change with context - neck pour, alone, with friends, with water, as the bottle ages, what you drink immediately before or after.

My catchphrase is 'Every glass is different, even from the same bottle'.

And let's face it, everyone gets something different. I used to collect reviews from Whisky Mag, written by experts, that were completely different.

\---

How is the mouthfeel, big and waxy, coating? That said, being a bit short, or plain dry isn't necessarily a bad thing: and something that at first strikes me as a bit plain and simple, on reflection might turn out to be a perfect summer picnic dram, maybe enjoyable with ice. You're getting barley instead of cask!

A bit bitter?  Think of it as an aperitif?

Does the nose differ a lot from the taste. That might be a bonus?

A blend of casks, ages? Cask type(s). Are you getting malolactic fermentation, or a different yeast/barley variety. (sure, these help make up part of the 'flavour list' but they'll be important characters in helping you appreciate, contrast, and remember that dram in particular).

\---

Preconceptions can colour your experience, which is about so much more than listing flavours. So many times, my first impression of a bottle is coloured or even distorted by my own hopes, or expectations. Then halfway down the bottle you suddenly have the aha moment where you understand what it's actually trying to do. Where it fits.

\---

That said, it almost goes without saying that flavour lists can help your appreciation and enjoyment of subtler aspects you may have missed. But try not to look at them in advance.

Then as your skills improve, you'll prob find it easier to describe whiskies in terms of each other.

So yeah, in the end, if 'It smelt like whisky and it tasted like whisky.' then what does whisky smell and taste like. what makes this one different, and how would you describe it to someone who'd never tried that one?

TLDR: Mouthfeel. Length. Complexity. \*Balance\*.And let's not forget value.

I need a dram! : )
I'm shocked the reviewer didn't highlight the ever-present lychee fruit, which seems to be a favorite of the Pretentious Reviewers Society. Of course, most people wouldn't know what lychee fruit is even if they fell face-first into a vat of the stuff.
It really depends. Some people do have exceptional sense of taste and smell and can taste or smell vetter than others. And some people have simply practiced tasting a lot and learning how to express what they're experiencing. It's a learnable skill.

Its just like art or  food. You look at a painting and see the whole picture, an artist sees a compilation of various layers and techniques used to achieve the picture. You most likely sit down at a restaurant and either the food tastes good or bad. A chef would taste the same dish and immediately notice ""oh it tastes like they used a little bit of cumin in the dry rub, and I bet that's a hint of rosemary in the red wine reduction"".

But if you ate that same dish over and over and THEN tried one that had a different seasoning, you would notice. And if you made yourself very familiar with all the different t flavors of each herb you would know right away what it was. Whisky is the same way.
There‚Äôs these chemicals called Congeners that are present after the distillation process that account for a lot of the taste and smell of spirits. You can actually practice at tasting and noticing these by printing out a tasting guide and just make an evening out of it.  
Pour some whiskey and smell taste after a minute.  Then try it after another and write down or circle any taste or aromas you notice and note if anything changes.  What makes a ‚Äúpeated whiskey‚Äù? Break that down into each flavor / aroma. You can also add a drop or two of water and repeat.  It‚Äôs harder at first but you‚Äôll get better and hopefully most importantly you‚Äôre having fun.

As for the styles people write their tasting notes some get very descriptive but they‚Äôre usually more interesting than a list of ‚Äú cherry, oak, grandmas shed, vanilla‚Äù so there‚Äôs some give and take haha.
You say Talisker 10 tastes like peaty whisky? Have you had other peaty whisky? If so, does it taste the exact same way as Talisker 10? If not, how does Talisker 10 taste different? These differences is flavors are the basis for tasting notes.
Someone smelled something that reminded them of a smoldering campfire and rosewater and then sat down to write. If your nose is intact and you take notes, you'll be able to smell some things too. It's pretty subjective so you're not going to smell the same campfire, because you don't have the same scent memories as that reviewer.

Reviews are as much about the reviewer as they are the whiskey/beer/cheese/whatever. Reviewers have pretty easy lives so their writing is often infuriating. Sitting around sipping rosewater all day.
‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ muh internet ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù‚Ä¶
There's more than a hint of pretentiousness in that review.

I bet that this Master Taster would not be able to name 10 standard whiskies in a blind randomized test.
What a great thread... Thanks OP...

I find that there are some flavours, particularly on the after taste that are common... More often than not I really get roasted almonds and then almost a coffee / tiramisu type taste.

Which leads me to wonder if people's taste buds /olfactory sense are more discerning of certain flavours than others...
It‚Äôs all marketing hype. Nothing more. They use fancy words to describe a drink when in reality most will only smell what you described.
https://youtu.be/gYpdGaeNX-U?si=3wpUR36FzuxaG_oo
There is tons to explore on Talisker 10. Caramel, oak tannin, vanilla, saline, milk chocolate, heath bar, balanced phenolics, etc.
Personally, I don‚Äôt always pick up notes when tasting a whisky, but when I eventually eat or drink something else that ultimately have those some notes. For example - the Hakushu 12 Japanese whisky has garden herbal notes. I couldn‚Äôt pick those out on my own when initially tasting the whisky, but at a later date I ended up eating something with rosemary in it and it instantly made me think ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôve tasted this before‚Äù. Yea, maybe some people really lay it on thick with their writing of tasting notes, but I tend to not doubt what people say they taste/smell unless it‚Äôs completely random/farfetched.
So, OP, do you now understand that these reviewers are just that well trained and gifted. That they Really Do smell and taste all these things that they put in their descriptions.

Quite probably not on the first encounter with the whisky but over time....

Their talent is really impressive isn't it?

Enjoy
Most memorable tasting note I ever heard, years ago when I used to do a monthly tasting in a classic Brighton pub. The lovely landlord comes through to say hello and see what the line up is this time. Takes a nose of a rather good (I forget) whisky and immediately says 'this smells like an empty box of chocolates'

We all laughed, because he was spot on.

I think we may have had an empty chocolate box handy, to check. That plastic tray, the flavoured choc fillings, nuts etc, the cardboard, give it a go this xmas. Happy times.
When i first tried whisky i was so overwhelmed by just drinking pure alcohol from only having drunk 4-5% abv beers before that i couldn¬¥t taste anything but the burning of the alcohol.

The first time i had Laphroiag 10 my life changed, i do a lot of seatrout fishing on the Swedish coast and in this whisky i could taste the seaweed and salt that is present all along the along the seashore in the autumn when the storms come and in the spring when the ice melts away.

Even though that is a peated whisky there is a huge differnce in the flavor of an Islay peat and Highland peat due to what it consists of and what climate it is exposed to. Islay peat consists of a high percentage of white moss and is exposed to the salty air from the ocean whereas Highland peat is mostly heather and grass and is not subjected to any salty air, so the flavor is dfferent.
To expand on #2, it‚Äôs all about having the VOCABULARY, and then knowing how to use it.  

When I‚Äôm critically assessing a whiskey or wine, I‚Äôll run through common categories of scents/tastes (as well as structural descriptors) and then sub-categories, and pull from the vocabulary within those categories.  I don‚Äôt know if this is how ‚Äúexperts‚Äù do it, but this is what works for me.  

For example, with wine I‚Äôll often first go to ‚Äúfruit‚Äù as a category.  I‚Äôll think through various sub-categories of fruit like citrus fruit, tropical fruit, stone fruit, tree fruit.  If I note something citrusy, then I‚Äôll mentally tick through my list of citrus fruits.  With this process, I might end up with ‚Äúmandarin‚Äù,  whereas when I first put the glass to my nose, I wouldn‚Äôt have immediately thought about mandarins.  It‚Äôs not to say I‚Äôm making up the mandarins, but I didn‚Äôt land there naturally ‚Äî it‚Äôs a process. 

Another example of a big category for whiskey tasting would obviously be spices, and the sub-category of baking spices.

Again, it‚Äôs all about having that vocabulary established in your mind.  If you don‚Äôt know that ‚Äúbaking spices‚Äù should be in your mental list of spices to tick through, you‚Äôll never come up with ginger, anise, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, cardamom.  Once you have that vocabulary established (and you know what those all smell like), it becomes pretty easy.

(All of that being said, I‚Äôm pretty trash when it comes to whiskey notes.  It‚Äôs usually just ‚Äúmm, spicy‚Äù or something.)
I fully believe you. And you were a trained professional that made a living from it. Here enters Jonny that has a channel on youtube and he can taste the subtle notes of rosewater and turkish delight that reminds him of a persian horse taking a piss on a 200 year old dunnage warehouse floor. Give me a break. 95 % of these guys read up on other tasters notes and go look for those esters in the dram and give it off as their own. Half the reason peat , sherry finishes and bourbons are popular is because even normal humans can pick up on the big bold flavors( Im a fan by the way so no judging) I just call bullshit when some guy goes.  There‚Äôs ginger in here, but not any ginger, pickled ginger.
If memory serves the SMWS tasting notes are intentionally tongue in cheek.
Precisely put!! If the OP has not got the point they just don't want to know....
Blind is best by far imho. 

And making sure to keep a bit of each glass back to revisit at the end!
I think these kinds of posts will always be pretty common, but it seems like the community response here is shifting somewhat.

Before you'd get the same old circlejerk about how it's all BS and how everyone is making it up (for clout, I guess?). Then someone inevitably brings up that wine expert study that supposedly debunks professional tasting, as if that's relevant to writing personal tasting notes. Now most upvoted replies here are, like yourself, suggesting it's a matter of practice. A more reasonable and less dismissive response imo.

I think with more experience people realize that tasting notes are not necessarily BS, but rather unique to each individual taster. While that means they can be inconsistent and variable, it also means they can actually be pretty useful when you find someone with similar tastes to your own.
See that's interesting, because I do cook, alot and, even saying so myself, I cook well. And I have been doing it long enough that I can indeed identify those flavours. I figured my palate would actually have been tuned in enough to do the same which whisky if it was possible, but I guess I'm wrong. It seems from these comments that with time I'll start to pick them smells/flavours out.
I'm gonna try. I would certainly like to be able to break it down the way some people do.

And I will enjoy it as I go forsure.
Ok, I can see what you mean. Laphroaig is very peaty, whereas Lagavulin is less intense, more clean tasting. Doesnt feel as dense. But see, my taste palate is going into senses and physics rather than smells and flavours. 

It seems I need to practice more and eventually I'll start picking up more.
Describing flavors and aromas is fundamentally different than actually identifying whiskies blind. There are SO MANY similar tasting whiskies that I think very few if any people could recall blind specific drams like that. Not to mention that tasting 1 in isolation is totally different than a side by side which skews  perception. 

This is why when sommeliers are graded on their ability to taste wine, it's not their ability to identify a specific common wine. It's their ability to correctly identify attributes. So for whisky it would be like can you taste : bourbon/rye/single malt, cask type, age range, abv, etc
Yes. Definitely. Also, you tend to taste more what you are familiar with.  Almost never taste hazelnut? You probably won‚Äôt be getting that note in your whisky. (For example). 

I‚Äôve never seen heather in real life. If a whisky tastes of it, I couldn‚Äôt tell you. 

Your palate/nose is a lot about recognizing flavors/ smells you know from elsewhere
Meh, when I was drinking 8-10 different single malts every month (lots of drinking, lots of buying and a whisky club that met regularly full of happy alcoholics), I was getting quite a palate. And I could taste a lot (but not all) of the notes they were talking about. 

This was a few years ago, and my palate has definitely declined.   Still a lot better than a casual, but a lot of the notes are lost to me that I used to know. 

For those guys that are tasting and reviewing 100s of whiskies- yeah, you start to pick things out. Some of them I believe pretty well
Exact same energy as weed smokers going ‚Äúhmmm 30% Indica clearly and 70% sativa clearly with northern lights influence.‚Äù Fuck off.
Yeah but to say they are boasted a bit too much.. like they put a Glen Garioch in the ""sweet & mellow"" category, but then its generally typical cheesy note is even more overwhelming than in a Bruichladdich and I'm left wondering how they managed to feel the most of the other notes. 

And of course cheese isn't mentioned anywhere, nor at the nose nor at the palate xD
Oh yeah. That's what we do. Forward through together, then bounce around on our own. We have the reveal, and then get digging in. I also leave some for the next day. That's sometimes the most interesting to see who same or different they are in a different setting and on a different day.
I think you're right about that; well said.

Though I do agree tasting notes are subjective to the degree that it wholly depends on what the drinker has tasted and smelled (a candy note could be Hubba Bubba to an American, whereas someone from japan may call it a different brand of candy), I don't think it's so subjective that you could say literally anything. There are some flavour molecules present in a whisky, that are simply not present elsewhere, and vice vera. Four Roses bourbon doesn't taste like gin, regardless of personal perspective.

Edit, maybe that's a bad example, and I should have said bourbon doesn't have notes of juniper, or white wine doesn't have notes of red fruit. Some science is still at play is my point I guess. Though ultimately very subjective of course.
Exactly. The flavors aren't identical since none of those flavors are ACTUALLY in the whisky. It's just what the esters, phenolics, congeners and other chemical chains remind you of. Think of eating an orange starburst or orange skittle. They don't actually taste like oranges, but they taste enough like an orange that they can be described as such. This is why there aren't 'right' or 'wrong' tasting notes.

I might say a whiskey tastes like dark chocolate, and someone else describes it as coffee. Well guess what a lot of dark roasted coffees taste like... dark chocolate. The flavors are similar enough in our brains that without the visual input of seeing a bar of chocolate or a cup of coffee we may associate one way or the other. What I call lemon someone else may describe as lime. Tobacco flavors might be called smoke or leather to someone else.

All that to say, sit down with a glass and spend a good half hour JUST SMELLING it. A glencairn helps. And read reviews & tasting notes while you do it. See if you notice any of the same things listed, and keep track of what you smelled or tasted. It's very difficult to do without suggestion at first, and it takes practice but eventually you'll be able to do it on your own. Just don't worry if you cant rattle off like 50 flavors instantly, no one can really do that without BS'ing half of them or just listing off synonyms.
It is a lot easier starting out if you ask yourself does this taste more like A or B?  Does this taste like peat or brine (ocean salt)?  Does this taste like vanilla?  Does it taste like fruit?  What kind of fruit, if you had to pick one?  Is it floral?  Some whiskies are, some aren‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt matter that much if you can‚Äôt say what kind of flower, but recognizing a floral whisky is a good start (a lot of good quality Japanese malts are floral)

I drank whiskey for decades - and I could definitely tell you what I liked and what I didn‚Äôt like. 

But developing a palate came with a whisky tasting group that took it moderately serious and a Lot of whisky. I don‚Äôt mean volume, I mean variety.  No more ice.  It dulls the flavor. 

I never got anywhere close to what a lot of whisky reviewers were talking about, but brine vs peat?  Oh yeah.   ABV just by taste? Pretty well.  And a lot of other things. 

And I couldn‚Äôt tell the difference at the beginning. 


It was a fun hobby. 

My palate has really gone to shit in recent years - from neglect - but some things you remember
I would certainly agree that Laphroaig has a much more intense peaty flavor versus Lagavulin. To me Lagavulin has more of a clean campfire like smoke. While Laphoaig has this wet component, like if you put a campfire out with lake water.
Yes but isn't there some kind of connection between those two?

Ie. if a wine (or whisky) is known for having a note of hibiscus, and *if* the expert can actually identify this, the expert should also be able to identify the wine/whisky with the hibiscus note amongst 10 wines or whiskies whe tasting blind.

I do admit that I'm skeptical about ""experts"" claiming they can taste a plethora of different things because if it isn't actually tested with scientific methods, it's just something everyone can claim to taste.
Exactly, after the second drag it all tastes the same anyway. If you want to have a laugh, go on the tube and go watch sommeliers competitions.  I Think even the judges go. Wtf was this person drinking. And even those pretentious a holes do not scratch the surface of what a mid level whisky expert is capable off. Half these guys cant smell that his cat died 2 weeks ago and is bloating under his kids bed. But candied stone fruit. Yeah buddy. What the hel even is candied stone fruit. Ive never met one.
No, I agree with everything you've said here. 

I like to think of it like this: there are objective flavour compounds in a given whisky, but outside of using a spectrometer in lab these can only be sensed and interpreted subjectively - i.e. filtered through one's own personal history of smell and taste. ""Subjective"" in this sense does not mean incorrect or inaccurate necessarily, but more so ""individual.""
No I think that's a misconception. Your ability to taste is limited by flavors you're familiar with.  For instance I have 0 clue what hibiscus tastes like. So I could say floral but not hibiscus. Additionally, I hate coconut. So if I even taste something with a smidgen of coconut flavor I notice it while 99% of people wouldn't. Tasting notes descriptors to give you a concept of a flavor profile but every reviewer will describe the same thing slightly differently depending on what flavors they associate or identify. 

I think the connection you're talking about is when we say ""this tastes like it was in a sherry cask bc of x,y,z flavors"" which is what wine sommeliers do to blind taste. If they notice a flavor profile of green pepper, they might think it's Cab Sauv. But not every cabernet will be green pepper dominant. And if the 2nd wine you have beside you has even more green pepper aroma, wine 1 will not smell or taste like it at all bc your reference frame is skewed. 

Just because reviewer 1 notices banana and reviewer 2 doesn't doesn't mean that one is right and one is wrong. It just means to one person it's noticeable and to the other it isn't. All that said, there certainly ARE people who are faking it or who give way more tasting notes than they are capable of tasting bc they want to seem 'expert' but I think they tend to be the minority. 

I recommend finding a reviewer who has similar taste/preferences to yours and then using that as your baseline. We have a whole episode abojt this if you're interested: Whiskey Uncut S3:E12

[Whiskey Uncut](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6wAvxjvCTu2TrjxjfFdDkD?si=xLHOYKRtSAOTMghGr43udg)
anything from mango to cherry to peach to apricot... a wide variety of fruits with distinctly different flavours. to call something 'stone fruit' flavoured is like calling something 'sauce flavoured'
That's exactly it. Well said!
I have that issue with nuts and orchard or dried fruit as well. Just mention _what_ fruit it is. I love dates, figs, apple, pear... but not so much cherry and strawberry and hate plums.

I mean, I love those too, but not the variant recognised in whisky. They're easy to pick out so better to mention them than to call it fruit.

OP's clearly not tried to smell many things consciously. They should, it's fun!"
Whisky Review 4,"Meet the Beast of Dufftown, the mighty Mortlach 16, a sherry cask expression at its best!! It's one of my favourite sherry bombs!! This dram is smooth, yet its flavour is complex with many layers of taste. I get chocolate caramel, distinct sherry notes, mild spiciness, and dark grapes. On the nose, it has tinges of burnt wood. Nice long finish that lingers. I'm very impressed with this expression.  I've tried the 12yo and also the 21yo versions. IMHO, I think this 16yo is the best from Mortlach!

Holiday Hot Drinks Featuring Whiskey,"I know that there are many recipes out there but as a newer bourbon and whiskey drinker what are your favorite hot/warm seasonal bourbon/whiskey drinks?

I‚Äôm also curious if bourbon and whiskey flavor profiles and strength change if served in a hot drink. 

I‚Äôm also curious what your favorite specialty holiday flavored releases might be? Dancing Goat has one with chocolate notes that I tasted in August that is only available around the holidays.

Jameson for non-beginners?,"What do you think about Jameson? The problem is this. When I drink an Irish whiskey, Redbreast 12 is currently my go to. I think Irish whiskey is great for the Christmas season because of the notes of shortbread, butter, etc. But now I need a whiskey that is also good for whiskey beginners too who sometimes drink a little more than just for the taste (if you know what I mean), so Redbreast 12 isn‚Äòt the way here. I'm just undecided as to whether I too will have something from Jameson or whether the step from Redbreast 12 to Jameson is too big a downgrade for me... Personally, I never had Jameson, so the decision is harder.","I‚Äôd go for Powers or Bushmills 10 next. They‚Äôre affordable drinkers and very enjoyable for a beginner
Upping the quality but not the price: Teeling.   


Fantastic stuff, priced in-between Jamieson and Redbreast. Should make everyone happy.
Jameson is my daily sipper. Easy drinking and good quality whiskey. 1.75 liter is less than $50. Cheers !
Some people will eat your arm for Jameson
I echo the Jameson Black Barrel as a compromise.
Teeling Small Batch, my local liqour store offered me a sample when I came in looking for an Irish Whisky as a newbie. It's honestly better than Jameson and basically the same price. 
It's a bit sweeter and seasonal than Jameson which I quiet like.
[deleted]
John Powers 12.. or the Bushmills 10.. or Knappogue 12 (which should always be a Bushmills).
Jameson is pretty good for shots and highballs
I can recommend Teeling single malt and Jameson Stout cask
I have to echo some of the previous posts here and say Teeling is a much bigger bang for the buck. 

Standard Jameson is really not a good whisky to drink on it¬¥s own, the lack of maturation and the fact that most of it is just cheap grain whisky makes it a mixer only for me.

The Black Barrel is a halfway towards a good single malt but still priced way too high for what it is.
Jameson stout cask edition is not bad. Get a smaller sized bottle and try it. I ended up liking it even though I don‚Äôt like traditional Jameson.
I would second Powers Gold Label. Jameson Black Barrel is an upgrade on regular Jameson, but is still pretty reasonable.
Up until just recently, Powers Gold Label was the most popular whiskey in Ireland for decades. It was replaced by Jameson‚Äôs just last year and most folks suspect it was because of persistent ad campaigns that appealed to younger drinkers touting Jameson‚Äôs as the whiskey for mixing in cocktails. So, if you‚Äôre planning to use it as a mixer, it would be Jameson‚Äôs, but if you want the taste of a true Irish pot still whiskey, I would prefer Powers everyday and twice on Sunday.

Nothing wrong with Bushmills 10 yo either, but since it‚Äôs a single malt, it‚Äôs a bit closer to a Scotch whisky.
This ^^^
Are you suggesting the Irish whisky category is primarily Jameson?
This would be my suggestion as well
[deleted]
Oh sure they‚Äôre the big dog. But there‚Äôs plenty of quality Irish whiskeys out there that are not Jameson."
Your whisky/whiskey/bourbon journey so far‚Ä¶,"Hey guys hope you‚Äôre all doing well‚Ä¶

Quick question I wanted to ask regarding your own whisky journey‚Ä¶. I understand your whisky journey is a bit like your taste buds - it‚Äôs all subjective and no two will be 100% identical however I‚Äôve been indulging in my whisky habit since 2020 and curious to see how others experiences are‚Ä¶

What I‚Äôm wondering is if I‚Äôm only getting half the experience - I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs just bad sense of smell or a polyp in one of my nasal canals or just simply not knowing what these notes are, I feel all of my enjoyment is in the finish and very occasionally the palate‚Ä¶

When I attempt to nose whisky, I don‚Äôt pick out specific notes - just a general ‚Äúwhisky note‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt even tend to pick out flavours when it‚Äôs on the palate part most of the time‚Ä¶

Take the Tamdhu Cigar Malt II sample I had a while back - I absolutely loved it however if you asked me for specific Nose/Palate/Finish notes, I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell you.  All I know is I like it!

I‚Äôve got 3 other Tamdhu bottles in the house that I‚Äôm quite reluctant to open due to the fact that when I‚Äôm nosing the whisky I cannot pick out specific notes.

Is there anything I can do to improve this?  Or is it just going to take time?  Also how long did it take you to have your first eureka moment when nosing?","Yeah, I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I only within the past year or so started being able to pick out the difference between a rye and a bourbon in a blind tasting. Even now, if I dilute two bourbons to the same proof, I can rarely tell them apart. Means I‚Äôm a cheap date though I guess.

Scotch is much easier for me, but there‚Äôs a lot more variation there too. And often my tasting notes are just ‚Äúsmokey‚Äù, ‚Äúheavy‚Äù, or ‚Äúlight‚Äù lol
I was recently told by Drew Mayville the Master Blender from Buffalo Trace that our nose changes which nostril to breathe through every 2 hours. He suggests sniffing the whisky from separate nostrils. Hope that helps.
You have to widen your palate. Try new recipes for cooking from all around the world, because what you don't know you can't find in a whisky. Do not order the food, better cook at home so you can try to put less salt in your food. Yes, too much salt can - over time - spoil your taste. Try less sugar aswell, it does the same. Quit smoking if you do (not easy unfortunately). Don't use too much chili.
Be curious how things smell - sniff on things everywhere you are (but please not in the subways). You need to learn the smells and tastes.
I still don't know the difference between 'sewing machine oil' or 'furniture polish' smell.
Best I can say is just keep at it.   I've heard of folks intentionally noting tastes they pick up in other things as a way to think about flavor.  I get strongly identifiable smells from some spirits but not all.  So, maybe just move on to another if you're not getting much from one.  I also get more smells from the initial pour and generally (very generally) it fades as does the flavor into what you described as a""whiskey"" flavor.   I've not been doing this much longer than you.   That said, my dad is a big wine guy and he will tell you that he has never been able to pick out flavors or smells from wine.   He knows what he likes and can tell quality but not individual things like tobacco or leather (two of my favorites to pick out.)
Not mentioned too much but inferred: a lot of notes are things we've never experienced... Sewing machine oil, hints of plum and date. Links like this can help:
https://kybourbon.com/enthusiast-stories/build-your-own-sensory-kit-to-train-for-the-kentucky-bourbon-trail-pt-1/

If you're fancy they sell the kits for $100-500. Having them side by side allows you to ""find"" the smell or note you're looking for.

Hope this helps!
I‚Äôve been properly drinking whisky for a good 8 or 9 years and mainly with one friend over that period and tbh, we‚Äôre both terrible at picking out notes, every now and then we get a really clear one, but not often and tbh, it hasn‚Äôt ruined the experience at all for us, just makes it more exciting when we do find one and tbh, we just enjoy the taste overall regardless of notes!
Have you consulted a tasting wheel?    
Nowadays, many bottlers provide tasting notes on the box and/or label.  Consult them and, in the process of tasting your dram, see if you can identify those notes.  Start out doing that, and then slowly try to train yourself to pick out notes without cribbing.
I‚Äôve found that instead of nose fucking my glass and taking a deep inhale, I gently waft the glass under my nose, especially along the edges of the glass. The key is appreciating the art of subtlety. Also, I find pouring a splash of room temperature water and letting the glass sit for about 5 minutes really helps to let whisky open up. In fact, I had poured a glass last night and sat out back to have a smoke, and I caught a whiff of a strong cherry scent. Took me a second to realize that it was from my whiskey on the table. The smells were powerful enough to reach my nose from that distance. If you directly inhale the aroma tends to be overpowered by the ethanol. I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôve ever taken chemistry. They teach you smell in a similar manner to protect your nose from crying chemicals."
Whiskey tasting party,"Help! I‚Äôm throwing a surprise party that will have some whiskey tasting. Note: this is not the main event, merely a ‚Äústand‚Äù where if people want to whiskey taste they can. I really don‚Äôt know much about whiskey.

I think I‚Äôve narrowed it down to the below list, but I need to pick only THREE of them.

Thank you ! Would all of those still fall I to. Whiskey tasting theme?
I beg to disagree.  Bourbon IS a whiskey.  As is rye.  They are quite commonly mixed to make many of the various American whiskies.  There are mash bills that run from 100% corn to 100% rye and everywhere in-between, with wheat and malted barley thrown in for different flavors.    


The bourbon/rye blends are considerably different than the malted barley spirits that we know as whisky, particularly Scotch, but sampling them at the same event is still well within the bounds of reason and good taste.
Absolutely. Three spirits made from different grains, yet all named ‚Äúwhisk(e)y‚Äù
They‚Äôre saying not to mix whiskey with whisky. All American whiskey is whiskey. I tend to agree. The syrupy sweetness of American corn distillate doesn‚Äôt go well with Scotch or Japanese whisky imo."

I would recommend a whisky that is a 12 year old single malt whisky that is amongst the absolute cheapest available in Sweden. It's about ‚Ç¨35 here, which is cheap, and most likely around ‚Ç¨20 in UK or similar.

It's the Deveron 12 yo highland single malt whisky. It doesn't have strong flavors but all the flavors there are nice and light. To me it tastes like green apples and fruity so I find the whisky very fresh. I would recommend you guys buying it and having it around if you guys get a friend over who ""doesn't like whisky"". I bet they wouldn't find it that bad :)

Canasta and Bunnahabhain go together like peas & carrots!
oooooooh
Beautiful
Nice one
Got that as a gift for a friend. It is a wonderful bottle. Enjoy.
Well done sir! Slainte! ü•É"
Does anyone know who which distilleries were active on Islay in 1990 and were using bourbon casks?,I have a bottle from a cask that I know was distilled in Islay in November 1990 and put in a bourbon cask. Beyond that I only have some tasting notes but no distillery name‚Ä¶,"How old is your Whisky?

Edit: is it MoM ""Secret Islay Destillery"" 31-y-o?
As far as I know Caol Ila, Laphroaig, Lagavulin, Bowmore and Bunnahabhain were operating then and would have all been using bourbon casks. If you share the tasting notes it might be possible to identify it further? E.g. if its unpeated it will most likely be Bunnahabhain. 

If you want more info you should read Whisky Island by Andrew Jefford.
My current guess is Lagavulin
I‚Äôd guess Caol Ila just by the numbers. If t‚Äôs always been one of the largest producers on Islay, and there are a ton of IB casks of it. The lemon notes also sound like classic Caol Ila.
Thanks all! The lemon sounds like it might be the deciding factor‚Ä¶
Supposedly all th 1990-1991, 28+ year old secret Islays are Laphroiags. Many based this on logistics, but the primary thing was the cask numbers, they matched Laphroaigs format. However there are a few Bowmores out there with similar stats (sans cask number format, e.g. islay violets, mcmurray david, etc)
It is indeed
Just ordered a copy of Whisky Island - thanks for the tip
Many thanks for that! The notes should be showing as an image? Let me know if not.

They don‚Äôt mention peat so it sounds like Bunnahabhian might be the front runner
In which case, its Laphroaig. (According to the rumour mill).
Ah sorry I stupidly missed that. The mentions of smoke make me think that it is peated, and the other elements make me think it could be Lagavulin. I know they almost exclusively use ex bourbon casks. I‚Äôm definitely no expert though.
Alternatively it could be Bowmore, but I‚Äôm not as familiar with it. Good luck with your search!"
Gift recommendation: fruity/sherry scotch 150-250‚Ç¨,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for a nice bottle of scotch to gift my dad when he goes into retirement. He likes sweet, fruity, and sherry whiskies - mild sippers rather than cask strength, and absolutely no peat, at most a hint of smoke. For example he likes Glenfiddich 15 Solera, Auchentoshan, and Dalwhinnie 15 a lot. But he is also interested in trying new directions. 

I live in Germany, my budget would be 150-200‚Ç¨ minimum. I could and would go up to 300‚Ç¨ since I'm doing well financially at this time, and you only retire once in a lifetime (special occasion), and the man has worked his ass off for the past decades. But I have zero experience with whisky in that price range and no way to tell if it would be worth it. 

I consider the following bottles so far:  

Glenmorangie Signet, ~180‚Ç¨ - it has mostly good reviews and people say that it is a very nice gift with the fine packaging and all - which I find important, as it is a gift/gesture and not a bottle for myself where I would want the best bang for my buck and not care about packaging at all. And I think that would fit nicely, although the flavor profile appears to be a bit different from classic/typical Scotch. 

Glendronach Allardice 18, ~180‚Ç¨. Has great reviews and profile would fit him too, I guess. 

Balvenie Madeira Cask 15, ~160‚Ç¨ - the flavor profile with dark berry notes sounds intriguing, but I also find it hard to judge? Idk

Macallan Sherry Oak 12 - I'm a bit confused because there is a 40% version for 100‚Ç¨ and a 43% version for 218‚Ç¨. Reviews mostly say it's good whisky but overpriced for the name Macallan - but on the other hand, I want to make a special gift, so the big name would be nice too. 

Hakushu - I saw this Japanese whisky and it's described as fruity, but I can't decide between the 12 (130‚Ç¨, said to have some peat?) and the Distillers reserve (100‚Ç¨, no peat, fruity only). Maybe it's too exotic and I would rather get him scotch. 

Further ideas: Glenfarclas 25, Balvenie Port Wood 21

Which of these do you think is the best choice?
Can you recommend any other great bottle that fits the criteria? Also upwards of 200‚Ç¨, if you know anything remarkable.

Thank you","I would vote Signet. Followed by Glendronach (though prefer the 15 to the 18). Glenfarclas 25 is nice as well.
Signet is great, so that's a good option to consider.

Glendronach Allardice 18 is abit meh to me, if you can afford it, definitely get the 21 Parliament, one of my favorite sherried whiskies at any price.

Hakushu is supposed to be the most heavily peated whisky/brand in Suntory's portfolio, although by Islay, it's quite lightly peated. So just something to take note of. The 12yo at 130Euro is a pretty good price, 100% skip the Distillers Reserve at 100 Euro.

Glenfarclas 17 and 25 are both great sherried whiskies, you can also upgrade to a family cask for a fancier packaging like someone suggested. 

For a non Scotch recommendation, I will suggest the Redbreast 21.
Du k√∂nntest es z.B. auch mit einem Iren probieren, die sind immer sehr fruchtig und zu 99% ohne Torf:

https://www.whiskytaste.de/product/redbreast-21-jahre-46vol-07l/

Der z.B. soll ph√§nomenal sein.

Oder:

Eigentlich ist Fassst√§rke etwas gutes, denn sie bietet mehr breite und mehr f√ºrs Geld. Ob du den Whisky nun mit Wasser verd√ºnnt kaufst, oder ihn zu Hause selber verd√ºnnst, macht nicht viel Unterschied, au√üer dass du noch viel mehr verschiedene Nuancen rausriechen und -schmecken kannst.

Ansonsten w√§re Glenallachie noch eine Anlaufstelle:

Da kann man sicherlich auch nicht viel falsch machen.
Die Links sind jeweils die g√ºnstigsten deutschen Shops laut Whiskybase.

Edit: nimm keinen Macallan. Da musst du schon 500‚Ç¨ auf den Tisch legen um was gutes zu bekommen. Alle anderen von dir genannten sind besser f√ºrs Geld. Macallan verkauft unter 500‚Ç¨ nur teuren Abfall.

Glenfarclas Familiy Cask (30-y-o) ist manchmal im Angebot:

Der war letztes Jahr f√ºr 250‚Ç¨ bei Drankdozijn.
Signet
Signet would be my vote
Get an Michel Couvreur Overaged Malt Whisky in cask strength. Best thing I drank do far.
I love Glendronach and also prefer 15 over 18
Thanks! Honestly they all sound so great and remarkable, I wish I could buy them all lol

Is the difference between Glenfarclas 25 and Family Cask mostly the packaging or how do they compare?
Danke f√ºr die ausf√ºhrliche Antwort und Empfehlungen. Im Moment tendiere ich zum Glenfarclas 25. Wie w√ºrdest du sagen ist dieser Family Cask im Vergleich dazu? Den Aufpreis wert? Die Holzbox ist nat√ºrlich der Hammer
(Oh speaking of Glenfarclas, I forgot about the 21. Among 17, 21, and 25, 25 tasted the best, but only slightly more than 21 while costing alot more. The sweet spot is honestly 21.)

The family casks are more like special editions, while the 25 is more like a regular edition which you can find anytime, any day and it should taste about the same. 

The family casks are each from a single cask, hence they will vary from cask to cask. IMO it can sometimes be like buying a lottery because you may not be able to find out how good a particular cask is before buying it. 

IIRC they are cask strength, which you may not want to get for your dad.
Ich denk, der 25-y-o ist viel besser im PLV. Bestpreis d√ºrfte so 179‚Ç¨ sein. Bei Whiskytaste.de. Von dem gibt es aber verschiedene Abf√ºllungen, kann also sein, das es eine g√ºnstigere irgendwo gibt."
An interesting assortment from Atom Brands,"Went to an independent bottler tasting with quite the range. The first one was not great ‚Äî a blend of Canadian corn whisky with no finish. The maple flavor, which could have been interesting (as well as overbearing), was understated.

The second whisky was savory and unplaceable in terms of tasting notes until reading the label. I can see how this would be suitable for passing around a fire on a brisk night.

The third was a more familiar oloroso speyside. Very drinkable but not much more to say there.

The 28YO from Cambus, a closed distillery, was a real treat. The nose had tropical notes and I thought I detected coconut upon tasting, leading me to think it was a rum cask finish. But it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äî just mellowed sweetness with age.

The last one was 1993 Laphroig bottled at 25 years. I thought it was Lagavulin at first given how smooth and subdued the peat was but again it was the work of aged maturation. 1993 Laphroig is known for its distinct peppery taste that sets it apart from other Laphroigs.",
"Smokehead Extra Rare not too strong in smoke but has a bit of butter and citrus. It also has a similar smell like Ardbeg 10. The palate is not too sweet and has peat and smoke flavors with a little seawater taste. Sherry and peppery notes are also present. Overall, a good Islay whisky. ü•É",,"I'm a fan of smokehead but the branding is absolutely terrible. It looks like they're trying to sell to the fireball crowd.
Sounds incredible, Slainte!
Lovely drop of whisky
Seriously. I have enjoyed everything of there's I've tried, but yeah the artwork is atrocious.
Indeed."
Yamazaki 12 Alternative?,"I'd be curious to hear the communities thoughts on a similar (*or better*) bottle that is close to Yamazaki 12, but ideally cheaper or around the same price point? The best price I found in the NYC area is for $160 for a bottle of Yamazaki 12. In particular about the Yamazaki, I enjoy the flavor profile and how smooth it is to drink/enjoy. *For additional context, the suggestions do not have to be of Japanese origin.*

I've had a few suggestions from friends and at liquor store for the following bottles, I‚Äôm curious if anyone here can chime in:

1. Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt ($85)
   1. This was mentioned to me as being closest to the flavor profile of the Yamazaki 12
2. Nikka from the Barrel ($99)
   1. This was mentioned elsewhere as a unique bottle, but leans more towards a bourbon style due to the higher proof.
3. Mars Shinsu Komagatake 2022 ($130)
   1. Context provided here, it's a similar top tier whisky that has a unique flavor profile & makes for a great sipper.   It's quite a different expression compared to the Yamazaki 12, but may fill a similar niche.
4. Ichiros Malt & Grain World Whisky ($90)
5. The Balvenie The Sweet Toast of American Oak ($85)
6. The Balvenie 12 Year Old DoubleWood ($65)

For additional context / suggestions, here are a few bottles I deeply enjoy currently:

1. Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky
   1. I really enjoy how smooth this bottle is, the notes are delicious and I love that lingering sweet finish.
2. Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky
   1. I'm a big fan of the complexity and spiciness in this bottle. Compared to the above malt version I enjoy the complexity/taste more from the grain Nikka, but prefer the smoothness of the malt Nikka.
3. Hibiki Harmony
   1. I find the Hibiki to be a sweet spot for me - I love the complexity and flavors at play, and really enjoy the smoothness of the whisky making it quite drinkable.
4. Macallan 12 Year
5. Compass Box Hedonism
   1. Deeply enjoy that coconut note and also how smooth it drinks.","I find compass box spice tree to be similar to the Yama 12
I have opened a recent (if for 2018 can be considered recent) 12yo Yamazaki bottling.. its ""walnut"" profile (plus chocolate and lots of other stuff) it's probably to be looked into ex sherried stuff..   


I'd attempt a Glendronach 12 or a Bunnahabhain 12 to stay in that range. Either should come by significantly cheaper, I hope..  


FIY the Nikka From The barrel is basically an unpeated Ben Nevis, with like a teaspoon of something from nikka (probably coffey grain). From Mars I had the Shinshu, it was very ""turmeric"", but extremely different from a Yamazaki 12. Taketsuru Pure Malt imho hasn't much in common (I remember it to be more tropical/coconut) with the Yamazaki 12. I'd say the same for the Balvenies. Unfortunately I have yet to experiment any Ichiro..

Edit: a suitable candidate that came to mind later on: Knockando 18yo! Edit 2 also the Knockando 21yo maybe more that than the 18.
Thanks for the recommendations lol
Out of all the whiskies I tried, probably one of the glenfarclas. I've got the 25 yo which comes close on the palate, a bit more spice than the yama 12. I think glendronach and bunnas are closer to the yama 18 where there's a bit more of a heavier sherry influence. But that's just my palate. I'd look at getting a glenfarclas 15 or 21?
* Compass Box Spice Tree
* Glen Garioch 12
Thank you!  Appreciate the depth in the response üôèüèº
Maybe the Knockando 21yo is even closer in walnuttiness than the 18yo.
Sadly these bottles don‚Äôt seem as readily available in NYC, but I‚Äôll keep looking!
Meh. Not even the Bunnahabhain 12?
>Glendronach 12 or a Bunnahabhain 12

These are widely available, just can't find the Knockando (any year) from a quick sweep online at local shops.
I see well the Bunna is quite close (batch variation allowing). 

Knockando popped in my mind as I was nosing the Yamazaki 12, and I always called the Knockando 21yo ""Knocino"" (""nocino"" is an Italian liquor based on extracted walnuts). But indeed it isn't a widely available distillery and I've seen overseas is kind a different world to EU in terms of prices, availability (especially of IBs)."
Ardbeg 8 Years ' For Discussion' Committee Release 50.8%,"When I hear 'Ardbeg' and 'Discussion' I usually run a bloody mile.
The LVMH Smokey cash cow. If it‚Äôs not Hard-core Rock n Roll, or the latest BBQ inspired releases
then its mediocre high priced nonsense that I lose interest in the second they put the wee Jack Russell on the label.

This poked my interest purely because they did away with that bollocks and stuck an Age
Statement on it. Of course, you still get the marketing flannel but at least we have something tangible other than a sheep or a rocket on the front of the bottle.

 .....................................................................................

Nose- Rich and Red almost wine like. Notes of the usual smoke but then there are

notes of fresh paint. There are hints of red berries also, with the usual Vanilla and Coconut.

Taste - Very grainy, The youth is showing itself! But the hum of smoke is still there. Lemon,
caramel and malt are also present. It‚Äôs quite tame at Cask Strength so water isn‚Äôt need.


Finish - Quite Mineral forward. it has the bitterness of Dark Chocolate with a hint of lemon.

A decent Ardbeg. The 10 is still better IMO ‚Äì 6/10",
Which would you go for...,"Worlds appart in terms of style, but both seemingly of very high quality (according to reviews), which will soon be available at my liquor store at the same price point:

Talisker special release 11 yo at 55.1%, 190 CAD (canadian dollars). 88 pts Whiskyfun

Yoichi 10 yo at 45%, 190 CAD. 89 pts Whiskyfun (very recent review)

Insane prices for such young whisky but it is 2023 after all... Although the yoichi seems more fairly priced than the talisker when I look at prices on whiskybase.

Could obviously boil down to a style preference and I certainly enjoy the peaty, coastal aspects of Talisker, but I can also appreciate a simpler, more straightforward style as well which Yoichi seems to present.

So, if any of you have had the chance to taste both, which would you go for?

Thank you","I‚Äôd go Yoichi 10 as the old Version has been discontinued for awhile and the newer one just came out I‚Äôd imagine in limited quantities. But I‚Äôm also a Japanese Whisky lover so
Yoichi 10 is a lovely dram, or at least it was until discontinuation, it can be considered a giant symphony of the whole Scotland whisky production (there's hints of peat, hints of coastal, hints of sherry, hints of Speyside, almost if Taketsuru managed to create a sort of ""summa"" of the various whisky styles he learned from there).. 
I have a few aside but I paid 59 EUR for those. 190 is total insanity. 
To be honest for both of those, I haven't tried the Talisker, but 190 for a 11yo not even single cask, Diageo can shove them up to their.. you can guess what.. but at least the Talisker is at full strength, if you are ok in forking that sum, maybe I'd go with that.

If in the same shop, check the Lagavulin 12. Generally it costs a little less Vs the other Diageo SE and it's more of a safe port.
I wouldn‚Äôt buy either at those prices, but if picking one I‚Äôd choose Yoichi to avoid giving Diageo money.
The Talisker is nice, but if tasting blind I wouldn't have it pegged as a Talisker. 

I really liked it, but wouldn't pay for a bottle (¬£110 GBP). I'd rather have a Talisker DE or two - I really liked the 2019 one. 

I haven't tried your other option.
Kilkerran 12 :)
Thanks for reiterating the madness of those prices, you are absolutely right. I will wait until a summer trip to the USA where I have spotted some much more reasonable prices in general. Hopefully the many new and upcoming distilleries will provide sufficient volume to cool down the market in time. Although this is doubtful with the ever increasing demand from Asia‚Ä¶
Yeah prices are skyrocketing even here. Caol Ila IB has now reached 10+ EUR per year of aging (a distillery you could find anywhere, in any form at good prices)but so it's happening for basically anything coming out from Scotland. Hopefully the bubble will bust soon; the auctions aren't going so mad and flipping seems to be harder, there are hints but I fear there's still some grim times ahead."
Review #18: Darkness 16 year old Benrinnes Pedro Ximinez,"**Darkness 16 year old Benrinnes Pedro Ximinez**

Scotch Whiskey, 51.3% ABV

Distillery: Benrinnes, Speyside

Price:$149 for 500mL

Chill filtered: Unknown

Bottled: 2023 

Maturation: Quarter Cask Pedro Ximenez finish

Body: Russet/Sherry

Nose: Very 1 dimensional, vanilla, sweetness
Palate: Lime juice(?), peat

Finish: peat, aniseed

Review: I like my smokey whisky, but something I really detest is whisky that tastes of peat but not smoke. This is exactly that kind of whisky. Any time you see me put peat and aniseed together in the finish, it's a sure fire sign that I hated the whiskey. This is finished in PX casks but really lacks the sweetness I'd expect from a good PX whiskey. It's there on the back end if you really look, but if I tasted this blindfolded, I wouldn't be surprised if you told me it was Johnny black.

I'm really disappointed in this dram. I'll give it another shot then likely fob it off on some mates who gladly drink the aforementioned Johnny black.

**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** 
Nope. I wish I hadn't bought it.

**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** 
If I knew this was to their taste, maybe? Probably not.

**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** 
I want them to actually like whisky, so no.

Today's Tasting @ Blair Athol,"Today we had 6 drams in our tasting

First was a 10 yo Glenlossie matured in Bourbon barrels bottled at 43% ABV. Very light and fresh. Not the big Speyside flavours you'd expect despite coming from the heart of the region. 

Next was a 12 yo Blair Athol fully matured in a Sherry Cask also bottled at 43%. A really nice sweet biscuity malt - think sweet digestives. Part of the Flora and Fauna range.

3rd, and my 3rd favourite of the day, Blair Athol Distillery Exclusive bottling. Matured in bourbon barrels and bottled at 48%. Lots of vanilla and shortbread sweetness from this. Not something I'd normally love, but I liked it enough to get a bottle. 

4th dram and 2nd favourite of the day a Clynelish Distillery Exclusive.  Matured in both Bourbon and Sherry casks and apparently no longer available other than at a small number of Diageo distilleries (Blair Athol has 8 bottles left). Very much a 'Christmas' dram. I bought one of these too! 

5th and absolute favourite dram of the day. 28 year old Blair Athol Sherry Cask matured and at unknown cask strength. This cask is currently now sitting in the tasting room (pictures 4 & 5). Not often you get to meet the cask your dram is from. This whisky isn't available anywhere else and it the bottle the sticky note on it. An absolute dream. If you visit the distillery you might get a this but you might get something else if this is finished!

Number 6 was Carol Ila Moch. Not something I've ever had before - I'd only ever tasted the 12. A non-age statement and more lightly peated than some of the distillery's other offering but really nice. 

I was slightly skeptical going into another Diageo tour but this was excellent. The distillery is just at the end of silent season so isn't producing, and the ivy that normally covers the building hasn't grown in for the year yet but it's lovely little distillery. The tasting room was great and our guide, Miki, was excellent. Would highly recommend.","Cool but why the Clynelish and the Moch? They aren't from Blair Athol
I assume it's because they're all owned by Diageo - Blair Athol, Clynelish, and Caol Ila are also all malts that go into the Johnnie Walker blends. I've yet to go myself but it's my understanding that Diageo-owned distillery shops offer malts from the whole Diageo portfolio.
Yeah I know it's Diageo owned (like a plethora of other distilleries, to an extent I'd even add unfortunately), just wondering if I go at one of theirs, I'd want to taste stuff from that particular distillery only, won't care about others at all
Seems like Blair Athol is plenty available in addition to the other malts. Looking at their website shows that to be the case as well. 

So not sure why it's so bad to have Clynelish and CI also available? I know I personally wouldn't say no to a Clynelish DE, whatever the context ;)
It's not so bad it's.. I don't know I'd prefer only malts from theirs, maybe a bourbon barrel, a sherry barrel, the distillery cask they have opened at the moment like here. Like I go to Lagavulin and they make me taste a Caol Ila that maybe I'm going to visit immediately after xD
Hey

It's probably because 99% of the whisky made in Blair Athol goes to make blends: Johnny Walker 18, Blue and Bells. 

The only general release ls they have at the moment are the Flora and Fauna, plus a 23 year old along with the Distillery Exclusive. There just aren't the expressions or variety that other distilleries produce. There is a 'fill your own bottle' wine cask at the distillery as well - aged 11 yo - which would have been nice to try though. 

The Caol Ila or a Lagavulin was offered to allow us to try a peated whisky - BA doesn't use any peated malt at all. I'd assume this is more for people that haven't been to loads of distilleries or tried a whole lot of whisky. 

They do have some 1968 casks which might become a 60 yo in 5 years tho üëÄ

As far as other distilleries go, at Lagavulin I only tried Lagavulin. At Oban we only got Oban drams and at Talisker we only got Talisker. 

All other Diageo malts were available in the shop though - I did get to sample a nip of the Talisker 11yo Special Edition too here which was very tasty too."
Review #17: Highwayman Batch #3.7 Peatera Pt 1.,"**#3.7 Peatera Pt. 1**

Single barrel Whiskey, 55% ABV

Distillery: Lord Byron Distillery, Byron Bay, Australia

Price:$260 for 500mL

Chill filtered: Unknown

Bottled: 2023 

Maturation: 100L French oak super heavy char Apera cask

Body: Burnt Umber

Nose: Spices, Dried Fruits, cinnamon, citrus

Palate: White pepper, brown sugar

Finish: peat smoke, caramel, brown sugar, 

Review: I had very high expectations of this and it delivered. I could wax lyrical about this for days. Compared to batch 3.5, this has a much more developed nose. For a 55% spirit, it's incredibly easy to shove your nose in the glass and just leave it there. There's the sweetness one would expect from sherry (which Apera is) and the unmistakable kick of the peat smoke in both the nose and the palate. 

The finish is both long and robust. This is a dram that one could take hours to drink as the flavours really stick around.

The name is clearly a portmanteau of peat and apera, and the pt. 1 implies there's another barrel aging somewhere. The peat and the apera really do play well together, so I'm keen to find out about this second barrel if it ever drops. 

For those expecting this last week, sorry. I got sick so I decided to be smart and wait until I could actually taste it.

**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** 
It sold out in less than 24 hours. I'm too late

**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** 
If I encountered it again, I would consider it.

**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** 
It's probably beyond the price range I'd be looking at here.

Good Caramel and Spice Bourbon Without the Fruitiness?,"I am mostly a scotch drinker, specifically smoky, peated scotch. I do occasionally like the sweet caramel and spice notes of American bourbons though. My problem however is most I've had have a fruity, cherry-like taste, especially at the finish. I love the caramel and spice with light smokey notes but I always hate the fruity finish. Can someone recommend me some good sweet bourbons without this cherry aftertaste?

&#x200B;

Edit- Thanks for all the replies! Everyone seems to agree that Woodford Double Oak is the way to go so I'm gonna grab a bottle of that as well as some Knob Creek based off a suggestion from a friend. Thank you!

Edit 2- Woodford Reserve is now my favorite bourbon. It's warm and delicious! Thanks again to all those that suggested it.","Knob Creek. When I introduced this to whisky drinkers they immediately liked it. And although not a bourbon I don‚Äôt find Jack Daniel‚Äôs fruity. 

Tricky question since what your palate might find fruity I might not find that.
Woodford reserve double oaked isn‚Äôt really fruity. Mostly tastes like pancakes with maple syrup, oak, and subdued spice
I‚Äôm fairly new to bourbon but am a big fan of rye whiskey. While getting into bourbon I discovered that many distilleries include varying amounts of rye in their mashbill (which stick out to me).

I‚Äôve always found rye to have a distinctive Dr Pepper/ cherry flavour so could it be possible that this is what you‚Äôre picking up on?

Might be worth looking up some bourbons with a lower rye content possibly?
Old forrester or woodford reserve double  oaked
Plain old Evan Williams black is actually good if you want straight forward maple.
Have you ever found a scotch with sweet caramel and spice notes?
JD's banana, which is fruit but so different from what we generally call fruity that one can only agree that JD is not fruity in a classical sense. As a scotch -and not really a bourbon- fan, I enjoy JD (BiB) more than I prefer to admit.
Technically, Jacks Daniels is bourbon. It meets all the criteria for bourbon, the only difference is the charcoal filter the white dog before putting it in the barrel for aging (the Lincoln County process). Many distilleries charcoal filter after aging. Heaven Hill, Lux Row, Woodford Reserve, Jim Beam all have brands that are filtered before bottling. JD just filters theirs beforehand.
My favorite
I wouldn't be surprised if that's it honestly as I've never cared for rye whisky. Thanks for the help I'll keep that in mind.
Not a single malt no, but yes on blended, most notably Johnnie Walker Black. It has sweet and spice as well as a nice light smoky, almost-but-not-quite peaty taste. I enjoy it but it's a bit overpriced for what it is in my opinion.
Glenfiddich Fire & Cane. It's really good.
It‚Äôs one of those drinks that when you want it, nothing else works.
Yep, just wanted to stay on the technical part since it is a whisky sub.
So‚Ä¶ technically *not* a bourbon. /s

It‚Äôs technically not a bourbon because the [government declared it is not a bourbon](https://thewhiskeywash.com/whiskey-styles/american-whiskey/jack-daniels-bourbon-definitive-answer/).
Yeah it‚Äôs very tasty but I wish it were more complex for the price. I would love to see a higher proof version. Nonetheless the flavors are awesome!"
Review# 16 - Chief's Son 900 Standard,"**900 Standard**

Single Malt Whiskey, 45% ABV

Distillery: Chief's Son Distillery, Somerville, Victoria, Australia

Price: N/A as 30mL, This is a single cask whisky, different cask's have different prices, this is an unknown cask
Age: NAS 

Chill filtered: Unknown

Bottled: Unknown 

Maturation: Unknown

Body: Russet/Muscat

Nose: Honey, Vanilla, cinamon, 

Palate: Pepper, amaretto, nuts

Finish: Licorice.

Review: First off, this is an unknown cask number of a single cask whisky, which I admit makes this review kind of pointless. For something you may actually be able to track down, see my review of [The Cameron '16](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/zfvcqt/review_10_chiefs_son_cameron_16/) from the same distillery. I feel that this particular expression lacks a little depth. It's a sadly one dimensional whisky with a pleasant yet oily mouthfeel. The nose was quite promising but the palate fails to deliver. I would suspect that this is a bourbon cask whisky (something I'm not normally a fan of) except that the body is too dark. Chewing on the finish, I'm disappointed to really find no real depth their either. This is a relatively low ABV for a 900 Standard bottle, so I suspect that Chief's Son weren't super happy with this product, which makes it really surprising to find in a tasting flight.

In other news, I'm happy to say that I secured a bottle of Highwayman Batch #3.7 Peatera pt.01, which sold out in less that 22 hours (I suspect significantly less than that, but I know that it took at least 4 hours). Stay tuned for the review, which I expect Sunday night Australian time.

**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** 
Definitely not. It's a small batch whisky which just lacks complexity and quality.

**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** 
Definitely not. It's a small batch whisky which just lacks complexity and quality.

**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** 
Definitely not. It's a small batch whisky which just lacks complexity and quality.

Review #15 - Tasman Whisky Bourbon Cask,"**Tasman Whisky Bourbon Cask**

Single Malt Whiskey, 47% ABV

Distillery: Ironhouse Distillery, Tasmania, Australia

Price: N/A as 30mL, $220 AUD for 700mL

Age: NAS 

Chill filtered: Unknown

Bottled: Unknown 

Maturation: Unknown

Body: Burnt Umber

Nose: Honey, Vanilla, Raisins

Palate: licorice, Raisins, burnt caramel

Finish: Tobacco?, oak, long and robust.

Review: Definitely my least favourite of the Ironhouse lineup, but I feel that's a personal taste thing. There's a real bitterness to this whisky that stops me from really loving it. I hate that this is at the same price as their other product, but it must sell, right? For a distiller that has such gems, there's just something in the blending here that just lets this dram down. 

**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** 
No.


**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** 
At this price to quality ratio, not likely.

**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:**

Kaiy≈ç Comparison: The Signature vs. Cask Strength! Review/notes in comments.,,"Wow I didn‚Äôt realize the color differences, I wonder what the age difference is on these ones.
Recently did a comparison between some
Kaiy≈ç whiskies! I put the Signature Kaiy≈ç Mizunara Oak whisky against the Cask Strength Kaiy≈ç Mizunara Oak whisky. (Apologies for the lack of bottling on the Cask Strength, as I chose to put it in my decanter awhile back!)

The Signature is a subtle, smooth, and sweet dram, while the Cask Strength is dense and fuller. I thoroughly appreciate the orange, vanilla, and Mizunara spice elements to both of these whiskies. Alas, as I must pick a winner, I‚Äôd have to go with the Cask Strength - which is easily one of my favorite whiskies! A job well done to Kaiy≈ç on these products! Below are my individual tasting notes:

Kaiy≈ç - Mizunara Oak (The Signature)

Nose:
- Subtle, delicate, oak spice, toffee/hard candies, vanilla, citrus zest, perhaps slight peat/malt

Palate:
- Smooth, spice/incense, some orange/fruit, very slight earthy note

Finish:
- Subtle, sweet, notes from the palate still present

Kaiy≈ç - Mizunara Oak (Cask Strength)

Nose:
- Dense, more oak spice, hard candies (Werther‚Äôs), vanilla, citrus zest, perhaps slight peat/malt
- The nose on the Cask Strength is more profound, and is an elevated version of the standard nose

Palate:
- Dense like the nose, full, surprisingly smooth, more spice/incense, grassy malt, peppery, more orange and vanilla, caramel

Finish:
- Strong, lingering, subtle spice and malt, fruit
I think they‚Äôre roughly 7 years.
Surprising the CS is so much darker if they‚Äôre equally old!
There‚Äôs some science behind it, but I think cask strength whiskies are typically darker. I‚Äôm not too familiar with the reasoning though!"

Thomson Manuka
OK story time.

We went for a family holiday over to the south island back in maybe 2017 and coming through duty free on the way in to NZ, I bought a bottle of Thomson peated and two of the manuka smoked. My plan was to drink the peated and send the manuka bottles back home via the post so I could savour the trip a bit longer.

I did get the manuka bottles posted home to Australia, it was under the import duties as I labelled it as wine and got shipped off.

I get home and go to the post office to pick it up a few weeks later and as soon as I walk in to the local post office, I can smell it. Unmistakable smoky whisky is in the air before I get to the pickup counter.

The guy gives me a funny look when I give him the pickup slip and comes out with a black garbage bag with whats left of my package, Inside was a taped up bag of shattered glass and bubble wrap oozing the two bottles of manuka smoked whisky.

Thats my story about how I almost tasted the Thomson manuka smoked whisky, it did smell awfully good though. The Thomson peated was pretty good, I think my short description of that was licorice wrapped in ham.
Man, I envy you for having those. I've got my mind set on the Manuka Smoked one for quite a long time. I've had a Manuka smoked one before (Workshop Whisky, sold at Whisky Galore in Christchurch at the time) which was amazing.

And had a High Wheeler, haha.
Posted the [first review](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/10tdst7/new_zealand_whisky_review_1_thomson_m%C4%81nuka_smoke/) over at /r/worldwhisky, should do the rest when I find the time
You able to buy any of these in Aus? Off to Melbourne in April and keen to nab a few ANZ whiskies to bring back to Scotland.
Keen to hear about Cardrona, I've never got to the point of buying one.
Scotland of the south. I can imagine they are tasty!
Really curious about the Thompson manuka smoke. My brother just sent one from New Zealand to me in Canada and I am waiting to try it!
Any and all! Never heard of any of those.
I thought Scapegrace only did gin? Now I gotta track down their whiskies
Condolences mate, it's a good one. I'm not sure what they're doing re overseas shipping at the moment but I don't think they'll be far away from having better distro
Manuka is definitely an interesting one. I think if NZ whisky ever becomes more of a thing (which it will IMO), it'll become the signature and every distillery will have one.
I'd say not terribly likely but it wouldn't hurt to find the biggest local store and ask them.  There are plenty of decent Aussie whiskies, particularly Tasmanian ones, so if you find a store selling them then there's a chance they'll have some NZ ones. We struggle to get the Aussies over here so I feel like it'll be similar for them.
It‚Äôs fantastic, one to savour. Got mine duty free from Queenstown.
Reasonably new. Two 3 years and a 5.
Cheers. Yeah buying them NZ whisky in Aus has been a crapshoot forever, there is one distributor that has some of the manuka in stock so I might splash out and finally see what its all about."
Review #13: Tasman Whiskey Port Cask,"**Tasman Whisky Sherry Cask**

Single Malt Whiskey, 47% ABV

Distillery: Ironhouse Distillery, Tasmania, Australia

Price: N/A as 30mL, $220 AUD for 700mL

Age: NAS 

Chill filtered: Unknown

Bottled: Unknown 

Maturation: Unknown

Body: Tawny

Nose: Dried fruit, cinnamon, 

Palate: Aniseed, Tobacco (? I don't smoke, but it's what I imagine tobacco would taste like), sulphur

Finish: spices, aniseed

Review: Just like their sherry cask, this was super fun to nose. Before I even put this in my mouth I'm regretting driving past the distillery last week. Sadly, the nose is the best bit of this dram. Flavour wise it's quite distinct from the sherry cask, but no worse. Subjectively, I think I prefer the flavour profile of their sherry cask as a more pleasant drink because of that aniseed flavour. I can appreciate that this is a really well crafted whisky but not one that's right up my alley. The finish is robust and long lasting, and there's complexity right through, and a level of sweetness not really captured by the flavours I described (part of me wanted to say ""sugar"" but it's not that swett)

This dram has secured Ironhouse as my new favourite tassy distillery, but Hobart Whisky are making a good case based on my recent trip (I tasted an incredible maple syrup dram in Hobart last week, sadly I don't have comprehensive notes for a review, but it knocked the Lark I had earlier that day out of the park). At $220/bottle (evening allowing for Aussie tax) this is a little steep for me just because the sherry cask exists.

**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** 
I think it will be readily available, and there are things I would rather drink.


**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** 
What have you done to get a $220 gift? You might just get this.

Smws have some strange flavour profiles and sometimes I ask strange questions like ""why are their peated whiskys only defined by their peat and not by some of the other profiles ? 
Can't a peated whisky also be ""Deep, Rich and Dried fruits"" or be ""Dry and Spicy"" and how many aged peated whiskys do we know that are surely ""Old and Dignified"" ? 

My question was answered this evening by this young Croftengea. The light purple label colouring on the label made me think it was going to be an unpeated bottle of Croftengea. A light and easy 6 year old with some soft flavours. Something I'll sip here and there when I feel like a dram to mellow out with and not be challenged. Nothing exceptional to even write this review on. (A bottle that would become nothing more than a bottle number and small review in my personal whisky notes)

But oh boy was I mistaken. I was pleasantly surprised by this ""Young and spritely"" dram. It's slightly smoky but still holds true to its SMWS profile.  

Tasting Notes
Nose: Light wood smoke, Honey and sweet fruits  with a pine nuttiness. 

Palate: Lots of soft smoke, Savoury salted and slight burnt nuts and little dark chocolate

Finish: Watery wood smoke with a light spice.  
 
I would say its young and considerably less spritely than a lot of its profile counterparts. It's soft without too much punchiness. It will remain my mellow out bottle now that I'm over the suprise.

Review: Just like the Sherry Cask, I didn't want to drink this whisky, it was too pleasant just nosing it. Again, Ironhouse have really delivered on this one. It's rich, it's robust, it's full of flavour, and the finish is something to be experienced, it really felt like my whole mouth was exploding. Is it as good as the sherry cask? Sadly no, but that's easily the best non-peated whisky I've drunk since I started reviewing (I did drink another 6 whiskies over christmas in a tasting flight at the place that makes the malt for distilleries such as chief's son and archie rose, was unable to write a review of any due to lacking paper).

First Review: Bear Fight American Single Malt Whiskey,,
Any of you noticed note discrepancies between Jim Beveridge and Emma Walker batches of JW?,"Greetings. I joined the community a few seconds before making this post. As i explained in the title, i ask you if you noticed any nose and / or tasting discrepancies between Jim Beveridge - blended JW whiskies (Particularly Red and Black Labels, but if you noticed changes in any other, comments well appreciated) against the Emma Walker blended JW whiskies, as i think she replaced master Beveridge a bit ago. I recall drinking and tasting Red and Black Labels in 2018 / 2019 and after years of not tasting them at all (Damn covid...) i bought a bottle of each a few days ago. Noticed the Red Label had a geraniol / rose note i hadn't ever noticed and the Black Label seemed to have an elderheart / nail polish note i didn't notice at all several years ago as well and seem to have a more bourbon - like finish. Notes overall didn't change much at Red Label, it's pretty much as i recall, but Black did change considerably IMO. What are you thoughts on the topic? Without saying more for the moment, i awai t four your answers. Greetings from Mexico and cheers to any of you enjoying a sip of any whisky.",

Chill filtered: Unknown

Bottled: Unknown 

Maturation: Unknown

Body: Russet

Nose: Cherries, Roses

Finish: Christmas pudding

Review: Yeah, this is a damn good bottle. The nose is rich, complex and full of exciting notes. I could spend hours just nosing this whisky, but eventually you have to put in in your mouth and it does not disappoint. The flavours just explode, spices and pepper up front, with the fruitiness on the back end of the palate. The finish is long lasting and pure enjoyment.

Review #10 - Whipper Snapper Upshot Red Corn,"**Upshot Red Corn**

Corn Whiskey, 43% ABV

Distillery: Whipper Snapper, Perth, Western Australia

Price: N/A as 30mL $140 AUD for 700mL

Age: NAS 

Chill filtered: Unknown

Bottled: Unknown 

Maturation: Unknown

Body: Chestnut

Nose: Vanilla, Honey

Palate: Slight vanilla notes, pretty flat all around. Is it possible to say water?

Finish: Brown sugar. Burnt caramel. 

Review: Honestly, I opened the next date of the advent calendar and kind of wanted to throw this one straight in the bin without drinking it. White possum advent calendar, 4/7 so far from the same distillery that I don't even rate. I purchased the calendar for variety, 0/10 do not recommend (Though I know there are least 2 Chief's Son bottles in here that I'm really looking forward to, I'm really digging their ""Cameron '16"" of which I was lucky enough to get one of the 316 bottles, review coming). Onto the whisky itself, which was as disappointing as I expected. Zero complexity, and I had to really dig deep for the flavours (maybe COVID is coming for me?). It wasn't unpleasant at any level like the PX Sherry, so I have to give it a higher rating. The nose did promise something exciting and bourbony, but it's just a generic corn whisky, and I think I've said elsewhere that corn aint my thing. I'm sure there's somebody somewhere who would love this, but I'm not that person.

**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** 
See what I said about the PX Sherry


**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** 
No, it's simply not worth it.

**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** 
It lack complexity, but it's easy to drink. Maybe I would consider it, but I'm sure I could find a better bottle.

I think I might just be the type of guy who would enjoy this one. One thing to point out, I was a bit confused by your ‚Äúwould I buy to open in 10 years‚Äù comment. Whisky does not age in the bottle so the only reason you would keep a sealed bottle at home is with the hopes of it appreciating in value.
Or it's a rare whiskey that I might want to revisit in a decade's time and crack open at a special event"
Review #7 (Australia #6) - Wheat Whiskey (Whipper Snapper),"**Wheat Whiskey**

Single cask, single grain, 45% ABV

Distillery: Whipper Snapper Distillery, Perth, Western Australia

Price: NA as a 30mL, $140 AUD for 700mL

Age: NAS (bottled Nov 2019, Released late 2022)

Chill filtered: Unknown

Bottled: Unknown 

Maturation: Unknown

Body: Tawny

Nose: Honey, roses, cherry

Palate: Cherry, butterscotch, sweetness

Finish: long lasting, aniseed, 

Review: I will say up front that they've got the price on this one spot on. It's a pleasant  drop with strong cherry notes, it reminds me of brandy to a certain extent. The aniseed on the finish is what really lets this whisky down for me, it's all sweetness until the back end, and that's just disappointing, and until I thought deeply about the finish I was considering buying a full bottle, but with limitations on bar space, this one just misses out.

**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** 
It's probably not worth it, so no.


**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** 
Maybe. The guy I would most likely be gifting to wouldn't like this drop I don't think, it's not to his taste.

**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** 
Possibly. It's easy to drink and tastes like fun, yet has just enough complexity that I could walk somebody through it.

Review #6 (Australia #5) - STRINGYBARK SMOKED SINGLE MALT WHISKY,"**STRINGYBARK SMOKED SINGLE MALT WHISKY**

Single Malt, 54% ABV

Distillery: Archie Rose, Sydney, Australia

Price: $199 AUD for 700mL

Age: NAS (bottled Nov 2019, Released late 2022)

Chill filtered: 2x carbon, demineralised, reverse osmosis, ultraviolet

Bottled: late 2022 

Maturation: Ex-Apera (Australian Sherry)

Body: Mahogany

Nose: Campfire, toffee

Palate: campfire smoke, paprika

Finish: smoke, mild chilly, burnt caramel

Review: An extremely pleasant drink that's smokey yet not peaty. It's a unique drink that's hard to explain because even though it's only lightly smoked, that smoke does dominate. It's meaty and savoury without me ever saying ""I taste meat."" The finish just lasts for ages. For such a young spirit, this is insanely good. I seriously hope they make another batch of something very similar, but maybe age it longer? I would pay $500 plus for a 12-15 year old bottle of this stuff (and in 12-15 years, I will probably be willing to pay a grand). This could be my idea of whisky heaven, but I'm going to leave room for something else to come along.

**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** 
I'm seriously considering it.


**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** 
There are only 800 bottles left. If I got 2 of them, I'm keeping them both dammit.

This sounds interesting. And I really like their extreme transparency. It's not often I know about the grist size of the malt I'll be drinking.

They only need to state the name if the farmer that farmed the barley - and his farm cats of course.
Have you try their Beauty and the Beast Stringybark single malt from a couple years ago? I think it was a distillery door exclusive. Super interested in how they compare. ( different barrels apera vs tawny )
Agree this is an excellent whisky. The filtration you mentioned is water filtration not chill filtration, especially not at 54% ABV
Heyo! Just dropping a note on this old review to say that I tried this at a whisky bar last night and absolutely loved it. I grew up on the edge of the bush in the outer suburbs of Sydney and I swear you can taste the Australian bush in the smoke notes. Beautiful!

Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength Batch 15,"&#x200B;

[There's still about half of the bottle left. Lucky me!](https://preview.redd.it/zxwsxx3iky2a1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=968aa68ca3142a746593c8df6a09970b3e52b183)

This tasting took about an hour.

N. Smoke. Peat. Vanilla. Fig. This is one of my favorite noses ever. You can smell it halfway across the room.

P. Dear Lord. Take me now. You get everything from the nose, but the vanilla is so much more potent on the palate. Oak also comes through heavily. This is quite a step beyond what else I've tried from Laphroaig. Don't get me wrong. I still love the standard Laphroaig 10, but now I'll always be wanting for this concentration of flavor.

F. So long. The oak fades---far back of tongue---and then the sweetness from the vanilla and fig---middle of tongue. You're left with lingering smoke, and lastly, just the peat---tip of the tongue. It's remarkable.

I let this hang out for about 10 minutes, and now we're back.

N. The sweeter notes are more prominent now, particularly fig. I love figs, and I still love the nose. Smoke has faded to the very back. It's wonderful how much our senses can change over the course of a tasting.

P. It's so smooth now. Originally, the smoke and peat were intense, which I liked. Now, it all feels balanced, which is also good. As with the nose, the smoke and peat have moved to the background, and the fig is the most prominent note. Next up is oak. The vanilla follows. I didn't remark on the body before. It's thick and oily. I really enjoy the body. It's not quite what I would call buttery, which would be nice, but we're getting close.

F. The finish hasn't changed much between tastings.

Okay, I added about 12 drops of water.

N. It's similar. If anything, the peat is more noticeable.

P. The palate is much more delicate. Of course, you're not getting that thick, oily mouthfeel now. I'd wager this is hovering around 50%. The smoke, the sweetness and the peat are all subdued. I get more caramel now. For me, that's a bummer because it's not one of my favorite notes. After all, almost all whiskey seems to have some sort of caramel or butterscotch note. I'm now able to pick up on some more spices, perhaps cinnamon and clove.

One last 15-minute rest. Let's see.

N. Less exciting. Smells like a lot of delicious notes have evaporated. Smells an awful lot like standard Laphroaig 10.

P. Much like standard Laphroaig 10. The vanilla is imperceptible, same with the oak. It's pretty much the peat and smoke bomb that you would expect from a regular ol' bottle of Laphroaig 10.

O. Time for my overall thoughts. I'd like to purchase a case of this. Incredible. 100. I think MSRP is $90, and it's worth every penny. I got it on sale too.

I found a store about an hour away that has batch 14. I don't know if I'll get time to make that drive for a while, but boy, I hope I do. I would love to compare the batches.

If you don't care for Laphroaig, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that your senses aren't able to find joy in such a thing. It's really fucking good.

Cask 12 is incredible.  First experience with their Cask Strength so my only comparisons are the standard 10 and the Warehouse 1 Cairdeas.
14 is a bit sweeter and less vegetal than 13 imo. Hope to find 15 soon."
Joey Dreams of Whiskey,"After my last trip to Japan in 2018 with my wife, we booked the Suntory Yamazaki tour and visited the distillery about 30 minutes south of Kyoto.

When a recent business opportunity arose to travel to Japan for two weeks, I jumped at the chance to extend my stay for an extra week solo to visit a couple more. Over the extended 7 days I managed to visit the Suntory Yamazaki Distillery twice (Once to tour and once just for tasting), the Suntory Hakushu Distillery and the Nikka Miyagikyo distillery.

Out of all three, Hakushu and Miyagikyo during these Autumn months proved to be spectacular in the surrounding scenery while also being a bit cold to someone who is used to the climate in Queensland, Australia. While the Yamazaki distillery is quite easy to get to, being a short 30-minute train ride from Kyoto station, the other two proved to require some more effort on my part. My business trip left me in Kyoto where I stayed for an extra 3 nights. After visiting Yamazaki with my colleagues to visit the tasting bar before they left, I returned 2 days later as I had booked the distillery tour. Both the Suntory tours were difficult to get into and required me to sit on my computer some months before at the exact moment they opened to get a spot. All tours were in Japanese; however, Suntory provides an app for iphone or android with English audio and Nikka provides a handheld English audio guide. I can say the Yamazaki tour hadn‚Äôt changed a bit from when I was there in 2018, not that it had too. It was still great to redo four years later.

After the tour we were taken to a separate tasting room, a tray with their White Oak Cask Malt Whisky, Wine Cask Malt Whisky and Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky was waiting for each of us. Each whisky is explained including colour, aroma and tasting notes. We were then given another Yamazaki Single Malt and taught how to make a High Ball using their Yamazaki soda water made from the same water they use in their whisky. If you‚Äôre lucky like me, there will be someone who doesn't really like whisky and will give you theirs to taste. Once complete we were led back to the main building to the gift shop. There were a few things I picked up, but sadly not much in the way of whisky unlike last time when I was able to get a couple of the small distillery limited bottles. Yamazaki has by far the best-looking tasting bar where you can pay between ¬•300 - ¬•500 (\~$3-$5) for 15 mils, including their 18-year and 25-year single malts. I ended up getting a set of 3, the Hibiki 21, Hakushu 18 and Yamazaki 18. All were great, I really enjoyed the Hakushu‚Äôs subtle peat. From there it was a 15-minute walk and a 30-minute train back to Kyoto station in time to get ready for the next adventure.

[Suntory - Yamazaki](https://imgur.com/a/3AMm4rA)

Like I said earlier, the next two distilleries were an order of magnitude harder to access, and as such I was the only foreigner (Gaijin) I saw the entire time. The Suntory Hakushu distillery is located near the Minami alps and if I were to use my JR train pass, would have required 3 trains and 2 transfers and as it was not the weekend the shuttle bus was not running. I decided to stay the night in a small town called Mishima halfway back to Tokyo. The next morning, I picked up a car from Toyota rent-a-car as soon as they opened at 8 am and headed out. A quick visit to the Mishima skywalk killed some time as my tour wasn‚Äôt booked until 1:30 pm. The drive wasn‚Äôt too bad, this was my first time driving in Japan, although it took me a while to figure out if the speed limit was 80 or 120 KM/h. Turns out the 80 is only for heavy vehicles on that stretch of road. The scenery again was amazing, with the clouds disappearing as I passed mount Fuji giving me a great view as I passed. After exiting the highway, the road takes a turn over a river and passes some small rural towns before arriving and the distillery turnoff. After passing the entrance and signing in I walked into what seemed like the forest and past a bird sanctuary, which the distillery has many influences of. After walking through the museum and taking photos It was time to start the tour. The helpful staff unlocked the Suntory audio guide on my phone that let me listen in English. The tour kept the same order as the Yamazaki; however, we boarded a small bus to travel up to the barrel storage warehouse. As with all the distilleries, as soon as you step foot in the storage warehouse the aroma of the ageing barrels and whisky fills your nose and mouth, you can taste it in the air. After taking the bus back to the main building we were led to the tasting room with views of the orange trees and forest behind. Sadly, because I drove, I was unable to partake in the tasting. They take this very seriously with a different coloured lanyard and multiple signs/ reminders about drinking and driving. Japan has a zero level for drink driving so it‚Äôs never worth the risk. Despite not being able to taste the whisky here I still stayed and was provided with some non-alcoholic options. They keep the same format as Yamazaki but with tasting the Hakushu Single Malt and making a high ball to finish off. They also gave me a nice Hakushu tumbler in lieu of the whisky. After the 2.5-hour drive back to Mishima and after getting lost down some little one-way back streets in the dark I was finally able to navigate a Japanese petrol station and make it back to Toyota to return the car, only to find out all the tolls I had driven through earlier in the day cost almost as much a hiring the car. A price I was happy to pay for the experience, however next time I will take the 30 minute longer non-toll route.

[Suntory - Hakushu](https://imgur.com/a/YEp5tVA)

That night I made my way to Ginza near Tokyo station, which I thought was the end of my whisky adventures for this trip. My plan was to cruise the local liquor shops, which also allow tastings for an absurdly low price, until my flight a few days later back to Australia. That was the plan until a friend I met earlier at Yamazaki mentioned he had taken an impromptu trip to the Nikka Miyagikyo distillery via Sendai. As having a JR pass gives you unlimited access to the shinkansen (Bullet train) and local JR trains, the 8-hour round trip from Ginza, Tokyo cost absolutely nothing additional. Without the pass this would have cost ¬•20000 - ¬•35000 ($200-$350). The day before I had booked a seat as the trains to Sendai are reserved seating only, however after arriving at Tokyo station at 6:30 am the next morning, still hungover from a night of drinking with the same friend, I sheepishly went back to my hotel after getting some greasy chicken from Family Mart. The unknown shots the owner gave us from a jar with a couple of snakes in it surely didn‚Äôt help. I woke back up a few hours later feeling not entirely better, but good enough not to miss this opportunity. I headed back to the train station and got another ticket to Sendai station; albeit a few hours later. The Hayabusa shinkansen is truly remarkable, reaching almost 320km/h, making the 360 km trip just about 1.5 hours. Once at Sendai station a local JR rapid train for another hour or so had me at Sakunami station. To be honest It seem more of an outpost compared to the stations I was used to. With no staff or gates, I just walked out onto the street under the small wooden structure. Luckily my friend had warned me about the lack of shops, so I had grabbed some food and Pocari Sweat at Sendai to take with me. From there it was about a 30-minute walk until I finally reached the small sign pointing to the Nikka distillery.

[I don't even know...](https://imgur.com/a/4wRDGyt)

As this trip was more-or-less on a whim, I really had no idea what to expect, apart from what I had been told the day before. After following the road past the brick buildings and past the sign warning me of bears, monkeys and some other animal I didn‚Äôt recognise, I finally made it to the entrance. I headed over to the reception to try my luck at getting on one of the tours that day. To my surprise, they asked if I had a booking, I said no, and they gave me a ticket for 2 pm, in 15 minutes time, and an English audio guide. Again, the only non-Japanese speaker there, so I was grateful when the guide told me what audio number to listen to at each point. The tour took the usual route through the history of the distillery, the stills, control room and warehouse. The only place that we weren‚Äôt able to view was the coffey still, although there was a small display of it in reception. I assume Nikka keeps this a guarded secret. To my surprise this tour also ended with a tasting, as this was completely free to attend. Yamazaki and Hakushu only charge ¬•1000 (\~$10). But still, they are just giving you whisky for free‚Ä¶ The tasting included Nikka Apple Wine, more of a liquor/ brandy and very sweet, but good, the Nikka Super Rare Old and the Miyagikyo Single Malt. During the tasting the tour guide came to thank me for coming and told me I must try the Yoichi 10 year at the tasting bar. Which I did along with a couple of others after spending a bit of time and money in the shop. I think they hadn‚Äôt seen many tourists for a while post Covid. By that time, I knew I had to get going as I had a 30-minute walk and two long 1 hour plus train rides to get back to Ginza for the night.

"Review #3: Hybrid Whisk(e)y (Australia, but really Scotland and America)","**Hybrid Whisk(e)y**

Mix of Scotch and Bourbon, 42.3% ABV

Distillery: 23rd St Distillery, Renmark, South Australia (but is it really? They claim it's scotch and bourbon so either it's distilled in SA xor their claim is true.)

Price: N/A as 30ml bottle ($82AUD as a 700mL, $10AUD as a 50mL bottle)

Age: NAS (mix of Scotch with a average age of 5 years and bourbon with and average age of 2 years)

Chill filtered: Unknown

Bottled: Unknown 

Maturation: Matured in unknown barrels, finished in bourbon barrels.

Body: Pale Gold

Nose: Honey, floral undertones

Palate: Malt, slightly nutty, dried fruit.

Finish: Smooth and pleasant, sweet yet nutty.

Review: I was surprised when I saw the price of this dram having already nosed it. I was blown away by the taste. This stuff is easy to drink. Weirdly the 700mL bottle in the shop says to mix with ginger ale and garnish with orange whilst the 50mL bottle says to drink it neat. Honestly, mixing this would be a waste. I only have one negative which is that the flavour doesn't linger on the tongue as long as it might, which is a pity for such a good drop.


**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** 
Maybe, this is a great every day whiskey. At just $80, no bottle of this is going to last a decade in my cupboard, but there's no way this can keep retailing for $80 when it's better than the two $140 bottles in my previous reviews so I may just buy a case of 6.


**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:**

Review #2: Tiger Snake Whiskey,"**Tiger Snake Whiskey**

Sour mash whisky (Bourbon but not American). 43% ABV. 

Distillery: Great Southern Distillery, Porongurup, Western Australia

Price: N/A as 30ml bottle (AUD 140 for 700mL)

Age: 5-8 years

Chill filtered: Unknown

Bottled: Unknown 

Maturation: Unknown

Body: Amber

Nose: Warm, honey

Palate: Honey then Peppery, fruity

Finish:exceedingly pleasant, almost smokey (for an unpeated whiskey)

Review: The nose is incredible. I could smell this dram for hours. Rich honey notes are accompanied by a feeling of warmth and enjoyment. The first sip felt cold and refreshing. I was able to leave it in my mouth for over a minute enjoying the mouth feel of a peppery whisky. The flavour reminded me in many way of a good cognac with a rich peppery sensation, except the temperature was off (cognac is drunk warmed to nearly body temperature) giving the drink a heavier feel.

**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** 

Yes, definitely.

**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** 

At the price, definitely

**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** 

I don't know. It would probably be wasted as an intro whisky but at the same time, the price is well worth it.

92 proof

Served neat in a teku glass.

My Tasting Notes: 
First off, the nose is is extremely smokey; this might be the most smokey whisky I have ever had. 

The pallet has some kind of spice that I can‚Äôt put my finger on and is a bit spicy as well; this is reflected in the aroma of the whisky. This has some bite to it, definitely a belly warmer. Very slight sweet/caramel flavor to it. Notes of almond? I think‚Ä¶

The after taste is a little funky, kinda like a warmish nutty-sour? Definitely not the highlight of this whisky.

All In All:
This has lot of complexities to it, but not a ton of depth if that makes sense; it is a very ‚Äútop of the tongue‚Äù experience. I like the extreme smokey flavor and the bite it has, I would almost call it a whisky for winter. 

Pair it with:
This would go great with just a baguette and some olive oil and a sheeps milk cheese like an aged manchego. I would focus on accentuating that slight nutty flavor with some roasted pumpkin seeds or marcona almonds. don‚Äôt think anything sweet would pair particularly great with this, unless it was something like pepper jam; keeping the spicy pallet.

Keep in stock?:
Yes. This is a very unique whisky that I think would make an impression on those who don‚Äôt even particularly care for this combination of flavors. There is just a lot to appreciate here (other than the after taste) if it were $30 more expensive than I would have serous reserves about it, but the price is fair for what you are getting. I‚Äôm definitely getting another bottle for the back stock.

Anything else?:
This must be a very new whisky on the scene since the bottle states that this only the second batch, which I think is pretty cool. 

I‚Äôm a big fan of the art work and the bottle has a nice tapper coming down from the top of the body. 

Does not state the age of the whisky anywhere on the tube or the bottle. 

Does state that it has been matured in ‚ÄúEx-Bourbon Casks, Ex-Wine Casks, Ex-Sherry Casks‚Äù

Cheers.
Stuff is awesome. Wine cask comes through and amazing price for a single malt.
I've seen this for $40 around my parts. I might need to grab some.
Smokey is where I live! Many thanks.

Help me pick the perfect gift for my dad?,"So my dad‚Äôs birthday is in august and I really want to get him a nice whiskey to celebrate, he drinks a cup like every day so I want it to be on the nicer end!

The Macallan Edition No. 4 Scotch Whisky Review,"  

ü§üHappy Thursday everyone! ü§ü

I put together some thoughts and impressions on The Macallan Edition No. 4 below. This Edition focuses on the wood management profile and presents itself within the expression. The shape and feel of the bottle itself is well designed along with labeling representation which I find appealing. 

**Fun fact:** The ABV percentage (alcohol by volume) beginning with Edition No. 1 and all the way to Edition No. 6 have increased in the following increments. 

¬∑ Edition No. 1: 48.1%

¬∑ Edition No. 2: 48.2%

¬∑ Edition No. 3: 48.3%

¬∑ Edition No. 4: 48.4%

¬∑ Edition No. 5: 48.5%

¬∑ Edition No. 6: 48.6%

Additionally; there are 7 cask influences:

¬∑ 1st fill: Vasyma Hogsheads

¬∑ 1st fill: Diego Martin Rosado Butts

¬∑ 1st fill: Jose Y Miguel Martin Butts

¬∑ 1st fill: Tevasa Butts / Puncheons

¬∑ 1st fill: Tevasa Hogsheads

¬∑ 2nd refill: Butts

¬∑ 2nd refill: Hogshead

**Nose:** Honey, vanilla, toasted oak, toffee, slight caramel, slight citrus (orange), ginger

**Palate:** Ginger, earthly taste / cocoa / baker‚Äôs chocolate, pepper, oak, citrus, sweetness of sherry but not overbearing, thick legs are quite present in the glencairn after aeration

**Finish:** Medium

After a few sips, this whisky becomes very balanced. The ginger and sherry are present but can hide some of the other notes that were mentioned above. It has some complexity and makes you think about what‚Äôs going on inside the bottle. When your palate is calibrated after a few sips the ginger and sherry calm down slightly which allows a fuller appreciation with what this expression is trying to do. I‚Äôm not overly fond of toasted type of notes, but the amount that is present within this expression is quite enjoyable.

**Question:** Costing aside; what's your take on The Macallan Edition Series? Do these hold the quality that their other products have in their lineup?

I have also put my thoughts on recommending this or not within the video. I also discuss some of the other editions and my preferences on them. If you are interested in following along visually, please find a video review under my profile. Wishing you all a great weekend ahead!

"Friends and I attended the Spirit of Speyside festival this weekend, short version: Go!","Friends and i attended the rescheduled Spirit of Speyside festival and attended a few distilleries and events and it was amazing. As this was a rescheduled version of the normal April event, it was slightly stripped back from the usual programme, but we did attend a couple of SOS specific events. Have a look below at what we drank/sampled and a brief description to help you decide if you're on the fence about going. 

N.B. Some notes etc. are more extensive than others due to my note taking on my phone, take a proper notebook with you if you want to take properly detailed notes easily or use speech to text App!

Friday

Tomatin Distillery (ok, straight away, not a speyside... It's a Highland, but it's close to Inverness and is a lovely distillery that can't be visited on weekends)

Tomatin Legacy

Tomatin 12 yrs

Cu Bochan

Creation 1: Black Isle Brewery Imperial Stout + Bacalh√¥a Moscatel de Set√∫bal Wine Casks

Creation 2: Japanese Shochu + European Virgin Oak Casks

Tomatin Pedro Ximenes

- once the largest Distillery in the world (based on volume produced), still producing Fantastic drams, the Cu Bochan is a nice lightly peated seasonal release and the creations are nice if you like something a little bit different. The 12yr old is a nice dram with a light finish.

Cardhu Distillery

Cardhu 12yrs

Cardhu Amber Rock 

Cardhu Distillery exclusive

Cardhu cask strength

Johnie walker black + fever tree ginger ale highball

- The Speyside home of Johnnie Walker. The Tour is excellent and nicely interactive with scent and video interaction and passionate staff (even the young ones!) Cardhu is one of the components to the Johnnie Walker blend and a lovely dram on its own. The Amber Rock is especially smooth for a no age statement and the 12yr old is nice as well with fruity and earthy finishes. The cask strength is an acquired taste and ok, but I'm not big on cask strengths

Saturday

Strathisla Distillery - Chivas Blend Tasting

Floral: Strathclyde single - 12yrs ex-Bourbon cask

Citrus: Glenkeith single - 12yrs ex-Bourbon cask

Fruity: Strathisla - 12yrs ex-Bourbon cask

Creamy: Longmorn - 13yrs ex-Sherry cask

Smoky: Allt A'Bhainne - 13yr old

- Chivas Regal, one of the widest known blended whiskies and tasting all of the individual components (see above) was a great experience, and we got a kit to blend our own (available online if you wish to try out blending your own)

Aperetivo Hour (free event)

Craigellachie 31

Craigellachie 21 SoS special release sherry finish

Aultmore 25

- The brand ambassador and matter distiller from the Craigellachie distillery turned up at the Craigellachie old bridge over the river Spey itself and shared some exceptional drams and a few fun stories, the atmosphere, location and fun of the event would draw me back to speyside for this event alone. The 31 was wonderfully balanced and smooth (and incredibly hard to find now), the SoS special release had a great sherried finish and the Aultmore was a nice lighter addition to the drams on offer.

Mash Tun SoS Festival Flights (free event)

- Lesser known flight

Speyburn Bradan Orach

Singleton of Dufftown

Mortlach 12yr old

Glenrothes Whisky Makers Cut

- Speysides flight

Abelour 12yr old

Balvenie 12yr old

Macallan 12yr old Sherry Oak

Glenfiddich Project XX

- The Mash Tun is a well known whisky bar/pub in Abelour and houses what must be the best collection of the Glenfarclas Family Cask series on offer anywhere outside of the Glenfarclas Distillery (and is the only place where you can by drams of some, the staff informed us that the Mash Tun is the only place with an open bottle of the 1952... Sadly i didn't have a spare ¬£1500 to try it!)
I had the lesser known flight and the Singleton and Mortlach were both nice and smooth and easy to drink.
The drams came as 35ml measures (instead of the usual 25ml served in most UK licensed premises) and the staff were happy to answer any questions we had (but it was quiet and if you want to eat in there on a weekend, booking is essential)

For any of you toying with the idea of attending the SoS festival, I'd highly recommended it! Here is some advice/pointers for the first-timer to SoS and Scotland:

- only try to attend 2 or 3 events/distilleries per day, unless you want a very busy/rushed day with little time for lunch.

- hire a car and have a designated driver, your DD will be able to taste the drams but not drink the given measures (drink driving limit is lost in Scotland than England and Wales) and your DD will be given Takeaway bottles (either a miniature or individual bottles for each dram tasted).

- Scotland is bigger than you think! Google maps travel times are generally fairly accurate so allow plenty of time to get between events/Distilleries.

- be prepared for all weather eventualities, the weather can change very quickly in the Highlands and being well prepared will mean you enjoy yourself a lot more.

I hope you've enjoyed this rundown of my SoS festival experience! (Please be gentle in the comments!)

A dram of advice for newer Whisky consumers or those looking to branch out,"I am newer to r/whisky and find myself giving this advice on multiple threads, so I figured I would just create a new post.

The world of whisky, whiskey, spirits, etc. is big, varied, confusing, and intimidating.  If you don't have some understanding of what you are getting into, it can also be expensive and disappointing.  It is within the interest of everyone within the community to help those newer to this world come into it with good experiences.  From what I can tell, the most asked question, both on Reddit and out in the world, is where do I even start?

In my humble opinion, the best way to get started is not with a sample pack or getting a recommendation at a bar or from a friend.  The best way to get started is with a tasting.

There are a couple of kinds of tastings, and both have their merits.

The first kind of tasting I would recommend attending is a general spirits tasting.  This would give you exposure to a wide variety of types of whisky.  Typically you'd see a scotch, a bourbon, a rye, an Irish whisky, and perhaps a Japanese or Canadian as well.  This gives a very general direction to help refine your likes and dislikes, and can point you in a good direction to pursue further.  A good moderator of a tasting should also be able to describe the differences in how the spirits are made, what they are made of, and what contributes to the differences in flavor.  For me, this was an invaluable education that allowed me to find spirits I never would have experienced because the cost and variety of options was far too great for me to even begin to make a decision on my own.

The second kind of tasting is typically geared towards a specific type of spirit.  Within a specific type of spirit, the flavor profiles can vary just as much as they can outside of the specific spirit.  What I'm talking about is a tasting geared toward, for example, Bourbons only, or Scotches only.  The first time i went to a Scotch tasting, I was blown away by just how different different types of the same spirit could vary so much, considering the small size of Scotland.  However, the person conducting the class was extremely knowledgeable and explained how the different elevations, climates, proximity to the sea, differences in soil, different types of fuel used to heat the mash, different ages, different aging barrels, different finishing barrels all contribute to the flavor of the finished product.  She was able to take what I liked and disliked about what we were tasting and make multiple suggestions based on my budget.

When you are in a tasting, its very important to write everything down so you don't forget something subtle.  Flavor notes, aromas, finishes, age, region, etc all play a role in making future purchases you will be proud of.

In summary, knowledge and experience will go along way in making sure you have a good collection of whisky and spirits that you like, and give you the confidence to make future purchases based on a solid foundation of information, instead of playing an expensive game of trial and error.","Yes, yes, yes!

Taking part in a tasting is the ideal way to learn about whisk(e)y, it costs roughly the same as a sample pack but you get the expert knowledge to learn the elements which will help you understand what it is you like/dislike about a particular style or brand and give you the skills to branch out on your own.

And thanks to covid there is now loads of virtual tastings which is ideal for newbies who may feel intimidated joining a group of ""experts"" at a physical tasting. Samples are posted and you join a sessions through zoom (or similar).

Local whiskey clubs and distilleries run them so do a search if you know what you're looking for, or for more generic tastings have a browse on the Celtic Whiskey Shop, a Dublin-based specialist store that ships almost worldwide although due to brexit, deliveries to UK & USA (routed though UK) are currently suspended.

You can buy 2 oz bottles from amazon.  I share those with my whiskey-curious friends.  It's a great way to share the hobby!  If one of my friends bought the bottles, there's no way I'd turn them down some nice pours of some of the interesting bottles that I happen to have open now.
What if you don‚Äôt like any of the spirits at the tasting and you get anxiety when friends suggest drinking or bring a bottle of ‚Äúwhatever 10 year blah blah single barrell‚Äù to share with you.  Like I‚Äôm excited as my friend you are excited and want to share that with me and the experience of whatever expensive spirit this is, I‚Äôm excited to spend time with you and be your friend, but I dead ass get anxiety when someone pours me a drink or asks if I want to try something or anything close to that.  And so many people drink bourbon or whatever these days I have to fake that I like it. Like it‚Äôs expected of me to admire the bottle you found and like want to dig in to drinking it with you.  Honestly I can‚Äôt stand the taste of alcohol, it makes me naseaus just thinking of drinking, especially some of the hard unfiltered shit people want to drink.  

Idk what to do or how to start liking alcohol specifically whiskey to just get to a point of wanting to taste something.  I 100% guarantee 90% of the drinks of good shit people have poured me I have drowned in Dr Pepper or something to mask the alcohol taste and just faked drinking it straight. I know.  Shame. Guilt.  It‚Äôs not my fault, I didn‚Äôt ask you to pour that for me.  

The only alcohol I have tried without mixing and not hated has been:  Compass Box Hedonism, Bumbu Rum, and Addictivo Anejo Tequila and Herradurra Ultra Anejo.  I did not hate any of these because they were all so smooth I didn‚Äôt need a backer or anything. Or sweet as in the Bumbu‚Äôs case and both tequilas."
What is your cutoff for a whisky to be used in a highball vs neat/rocks?,"I recently went outside my Bulleit/Buffalo Trace comfort zone tried Toki and Pendleton blends which I enjoyed both for very different reasons. I always try a whisky first neat and go from there but the Toki and Pendleton were satisfying both neat and as a highball. I got both for around $30 each so I‚Äôm curious how everyone determines what the cutoff is. Is it based on price or taste?

Side note: my favorite whisky neat/rocks is Dad‚Äôs Hat Pennsylvanian Rye. Recently moved from PA to CA and I miss it dearly.","The only way to drink whisky wrong is to do it to impress other people. If you have a nice bottle of whisky and you enjoy drinking it neat, go for it. If you like it mixed with soda or coke, that‚Äôs just fine too! I tend to drink most of my whiskies neat, but Laphroaig and coke is a fantastic drink.
All I would say is that there is a definite cut off to where mixing something expensive becomes wasteful, as the subtleties of the whisky might be lost. You might be able to taste the difference between a 12 year and an 18 when they‚Äôre neat, but maybe once you mix the 18 with something it tastes pretty much identical to the 12 mixed in the same way. May as well save your money in that scenario.
[deleted]
Suntory Toki. Really smooth and it‚Äôs well priced
I usually use bottled-in-bond for mixing. Cheaper and 100 proof.
Laphroaig quarter cask, as a single malt it's got some flaws, throw it in a good highball and it works wonders while retaining its smoky edge.

I've used Talisker with ginger beer before, also works well.


Living with 30 odd degree heat and humidity up to 95% means following a more Japanese approach to whiskey drinking here in Hong Kong.
single malt: always neat. Blended is for mixing/cocktails
I am from PA and love Dads Hat. My favorites are the port finished and honey. I drink both on the rocks and like to put the honey in some hot tea.
if it's an American blended, i can use it for highball.
if it's a Scottish or Japanese single malt, no way.
No cutoff. If I want to try a cocktail with an expensive whiskey I will. 

Once had some Van Winkle 12 and RC cola for my birthday, it was really, really good too. We had a full bottle, so just figured we might as well try it to see how it was.
I once thought that I would never use any of my really good stuff in a cocktail. Then I made an Old Fashioned with Stagg Jr., and . . . Oh. My. God!
I prefer to use the whisky I enjoy neat only when I drink it neat.  When making a cocktail, I tend to use the ""runners up"".  The weird part is, I've gotten some really nice rye that tastes great neat, but doesn't make a good Manhattan or Old Fashioned.  I've also gotten a sub $20 bottle of Wild Turkey Rye that is not so great neat, but makes an amazing cocktail.

Best bet is experiment and stick with what you like.  No one else has your tastebuds!
No cut off. But the general trend at my home bar would suggest it‚Äôs about money, but really it isn‚Äôt.

I love whisky on the rocks so I keep inexpensive blended scotch around, bourbons, and cheaper Canadian whiskies to enjoy on ice, I also love a blended scotch with soda and lots of ice. Rusty nails are not bad sometimes.

But my favorite whiskies will always be consumed neat or maybe with a small dash of water which brings out flavor
The save way a cocktail can mask a bad whiskey or can also enhance a good one. I love frsb in an old fashioned
My best experiences with ice have definitely been with cask strength/high ABV bottles, particularly sherry bombs like Aberlour A'bunadh. You have to sip along as the ice dilutes the whisky, but it's a fun ride!
If you‚Äôre looking for a good cheap whiskey try black velvet. I wouldn‚Äôt drink it neat but it‚Äôs plenty good enough for cocktails only a small step down from Pendleton at a much lower price.
I only drink neat, with everything I own ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Maybe one day I'll start making mixed drinks with my bottom shelf bourbons.
To each their own. With that said,  My rules are, if it has a cork in it, it‚Äôs as the maker wanted to be.  Put it in a glass.  An ice cube is fine. If it has a screw cap, you can do what you please.
Conventional wisdom (which I don't necessarily agree with) is that if you wouldn't drink it neat, you shouldn't put it in a cocktail, kind of a twist on what is said about cooking-wine quality. I can see where that's important with a straight-up, booze-forward cocktail like a Manhattan or Martini, but I generally use mixers to take the unpleasant ""edge"" off less enjoyable liquors (although I try not to buy them in the first place). For example, although I tried, I just don't like the highly-touted Evan Williams BiB neat or on the rocks, so I make cocktails with it (usually not a highball, which I find a little boring). In the world of scotch, some recipes even call for a blended whisky vs a single-malt, so I keep a big jug of Teacher's Highland Cream around for those. But to answer the question, it's taste and not price that is the first consideration for me; if it doesn't taste good neat, I'll hide it in something until it's gone.
Agree on all counts.

I started getting into rums, and my buddy made me a Cuba Libre with Mexican Coke and Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva.  Spoiler Alert: it doesn't taste anything like a Bacardi and Coke from your local bar.

Toki is really good in highballs, but if you want to elevate it (and I might catch crap for this) try it with Hakushu 12.
it's tricky to slake your thirst on a hot afternoon with a neat dram of whisky :)
It goes great with food and is great on hot summer days.  I doesn't work well with all whiskies, but I love it with lighter blends mostly.
Good points for sure but honestly curious would you drink Jim beam or Seagrams neat/on the rocks?
If the highball is made with club soda, I agree. My first experience with whiskey was my grandfather's whiskey-and-ginger highballs, which were basically sweet, booze-flavored soft-drink concoctions; it's like the ""Mary Poppins solution:"" a ""spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down."" At the other end of the spectrum is something like the Rusty Nail or the Rusty Compass, where the Drambuie brings a unique character all its own to the scotch.
Yup, for me and my Japanophile ways Toki is **the** hi-ball whiskey.
Toki is quite inexpensive here compared to other Japanese whiskies. I've been meaning to buy some.
Came here to say this, with the caveat being that obviously some blended are too good for mixing
I really like this as a nice clean way to differentiate
i love the A'bunadh! I tend to use a splash of water rather than ice though. to each their own :)
Haven't tried BV but wouldnt turn my nose at the opportunity. I was not a fan of the Pendleton. Unlike any whiskey I've ever tasted, with this weird rumlike sweetness. I ended up mixing with it. I am sure it suits certain people though
No water added? A splash really can enliven flavors.
Elijah Craig Barrel Proof makes a mean Manhattan. Sub in your favorite Islay and it works really well too.
I have tried highballs a couple of times (and Nikka Days worked better for me than Toki), but I'm not a fan - I prefer to have whisky in one glass and water in another and alternate between the two, one for flavour, the other for quenching thirst...
Which is why you don't even try to do that and grab a beer instead.
I poured a double of jim beam on the rocks and enjoyed it.
Nothing wrong with some beam. Beam has done me no wrong at its price point and goes well with a cheap beer.
""Too good"" may be an overstatement, but I experienced this when I bought Islay Mist 8-year-old for under $20, thinking it would be generic blended garbage only good for mixing. But to my surprise, with its Laphroaig base it's quite good for drinking neat; I call it ""Laphroaig Lite.""
I do the same most of the time, but ice is fun, too.
It‚Äôs on the bottom shelf in a plastic bottle. It goes really good with sprite.
Sorry, I do add a drop every now and then to a few bottles I own. Sometimes when I have time to see how it'll change, but mostly on one specific bottle of HM10; it was funky bottle that I only enjoyed with a drop of water per 1 Oz pour. I should have been more transparent up front üòÅü•Éü•É 

Before it's a topic, I've had two bottles of HM10, both not worth the hype for me imo. I gave up on trying to find a ""good"" barrel- like the one that won whiskey of the year ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Review | Cadenheads Glen Scotia 19yo Warehouse Tasting bottle,,"Whisky: Cadenheads Glen Scotia 19yo Warehouse Tasting bottle

Region: Campbeltown 

ABV: 53.6%

Price: ¬£80

It‚Äôs taken a while, but we‚Äôve finally gotten to a Cadenhead bottling. If you are unaware Cadenheads is Scotland‚Äôs oldest independent bottler. Currently they are owned by J. & A. Mitchell and Co. who you might recognise as the owners of Springbank. This particular bottling is a 19yo sherry butt from the redheaded step child of Campbeltown distilleries Glen Scotia.

Nose - Hit of salty sulphur, wet dog smell, campeltown funk, moist leather, rainy day at the beach, chocolate chip croissant.

Palate - a salad of rain soaked leaves, branches, and sea salted caramel. This has a shorter than anticipated finish. For having spent so long in the cask the sherry is well integrated with the spirit.

Nose (water) - Dunnage warehouse funk, cardamom and cloves, some sweet barley.

Palate (water) - Like licking an oak stave, dried shiitake mushrooms, thinner mouthfeel with more spice. We wouldn‚Äôt say that it benefits from water.

Conclusion - We both reacted with ‚ÄúOh‚Äù when we first nosed the dram, and that reaction was consistent throughout the tasting of the whisky. A very funky whisky that‚Äôs not for everyone, but some will absolutely love it. This will be a 7/10 for most, but if you love The Scotia you‚Äôll love this and at ¬£80 it‚Äôs a steal.

Scale

10 - Perfection. A whisky that we‚Äôll remember forever.

9 - Amazing. We‚Äôd pay through the nose for a bottle.

8 - Great. Pick this up at RRP.

7 - Good. Happy to have a dram or two but wouldn‚Äôt buy a bottle.

6 - Passable. Would accept a dram, but wouldn‚Äôt seek it out.

5 - Poor. Would drink if it was the only option.

4 - Bad. Maybe it can be saved by ginger beer?

3 - Awful. It can't be saved by ginger beer.

2 - Pour it out

1 - We‚Äôve never tried a whisky rated this low and hopefully never will.

Great review, Glen Scotia doesn't get the love of its neighbours but I think they've got some gems.

"Would like Lagavulin advice (Distillers Edition 4/502, 4/508)","Hi guys

I know nothing about whisky but my it's my brother's 30th soon and he does. I know he likes Lagavulin and i'm looking at getting him a bottle of Lagavulin Distillers Edition.

Question is i'm hesitating between the 4/502 and the 4/508, purely because they're the ones I've seen (positive) reviews for and seem to find relatively easily to buy online.

Is there a big difference between these editions? I know they're from different times (97/13, 03/19) but taste wise is one considered better? If there an edition in particular I should avoid? Looking at a budget around ¬£100.

Appreciate any advice, thanks","[https://www.whizzky.net/whisky.php?ref=4386-Lagavulin-Distillers-Edition-1997-lgv4502](https://www.whizzky.net/whisky.php?ref=4386-Lagavulin-Distillers-Edition-1997-lgv4502)

https://www.whizzky.net/whisky.php?ref=35144-Lagavulin-Distillers-Edition-2003-lgv4508-Bottled-2019

4/508 seems to have a more complex flavour profile.
I can only comment on 4/504. Fine drop of gear, not too peaty, not too sweet sherry, long finish, complex but not heavy, class in a bottle.

On whiskybase [the score groups around an 88](https://www.whiskybase.com/search?q=Lagavulin+Distillers+Edition) for the modern expressions, 4/502 gets 88.3 but 4/508 is an outlier with 85.8 rating but only 8 votes, YMMV."

Delicious. Seaside bonfire and akelarre ( Witches' Sabbath"" ) . Tasting notes no mine:

""**Nose:** Peat and vanilla, creosote, dried herbs, harbour rope, sweet biscuits and orchard fruit.

**Palate:** Sweet and smoky, lemon, salt and pepper. Beneath there's oak and malt and hints of sand dune.

**Finish:** More sweet smoke and citrus.""

"Review #4 Sm√∂gen#100 Proof, Notes in the comments",,"My first ever Sm√∂gen, I‚Äôm being honest here, I stumbled across Sm√∂gen because of a great score by Serge on whiskyfun, and 100‚Ç¨ for 0,5L is normally something I would not buy, especially not a 6 year old whisky. I could get a 20 year old Glenrothes for this price, but my mates and I have an international tasting and I saw that this is available so, yolo, I bought it. The hard facts read quite interesting, but can a 6 year old Swedish whisky show up for this price point? I have a personal connection to Sweden, so I want this to do good. 

  
Nose 88: Smoke immediately fills my nose. It‚Äôs a very earthy, medicinal, bacon nose. Hell I would think this would be a Laphroaig if I did not know better. After the smoke there is a lovely vanilla sweetness, accompanied by elderflower and, I know this sounds weird, but a book from university library. You can also smell the sherry cask influence with a berry sweetness that goes into the direction of strawberries and cherries. I also get a hint of limes and salt. The nose is very complex and gives so much away already. Definitely more exciting than the age statement 

  
Taste 88 : Very very smooth. This goes down so easily, it is very sweet but the sweetness of dark berries and vanilla and sugar is immediately replaced by a lovely smoke note that again is very different to everything I ever tasted. It is quite spicy but again with bacon and medicine. Oak immediately fills my mouth as well but it is very very good. Well balanced and quite easily a lot of fun.

   
Finish 90: Very long and complex. There is so much going on here. Confirms the taste. But it starts much smokier than the taste and then goes into the sweet notes like strawberries, cherries, cake, and the oak has a nice influence as well. I also get a nice combination of different spices combining with the wood. There is a lingering smokey and salty note in the back that just simply keeps on going after a couple of minutea I also get a smoky bloody mary, what the hell is going on here. This is so complex I‚Äôm amazed.

  
I‚Äôm so torn with this whisky. It is very good‚Ä¶ but the price point‚Ä¶ If this bottling was 0,7L I‚Äôd recommend it immediately. Make sure you get a sample before you buy a bottle, I would not buy a bottle again but I love it.
One of my favourite ever whiskies
One of my favorite whiskies, and strangely only maybe the third or fourth best bottle Sm√∂gen has ever produced. Their problem has always been that they've had very small runs; this is as far as I know their first widely available bottling. The hope is that as their later casks mature, either price or the size of the bottles will change, because with this good a whisky it's a pity not more people will get to taste it.
Sk√•l! There's some great Swedish whisky out there, and there's plenty of horrible stuff too. Sm√∂gen and High Coast are both amazingly solid for their usually young age.
I would not buy a bottle again, but I love it? Are there bottles you don‚Äôt love, but would buy again?
Hmmm it is in my top 10 for sure. And if it were a 0,7 bottle for 99‚Ç¨ I'd immediately recommend it to everyone I know. But with it being a 0,5L bottle it loses against an ardbeg uigedail, a lagavulin destillery edition, a port Charlotte from the cask exploration series or a Laphroaig 10 cask strength. Not necessarily because of the taste but because oft the price to performance ratio. Taste wise it is right up there with lots of whiskies.
Agreed!
No but even though I love it I would not buy a bottle again."
Best high-end Glenmorangie? Grand Vintage 1989 / 1990 or Quarter Century?,"I‚Äôm thinking about picking up a very nice bottle of Glenmorangie.. but I can‚Äôt decide. Both the 1989 and 1990 have great reviews and very similar scores among the online reviews... maybe the 1990 has a bit of an edge. Also the noticable pepper taste in the 1989 scares me a bit.. I fear it‚Äôs going to be a bit too funky for me.

I‚Äôd appreciate any insights. Thanks!",

**No Age Statement, 43% ABV 750ml**  

&#x200B;

**The History:** 

Taketsuru Pure Malt is a blended malt whiskys. This was named in an hour of Nikka Distillery founder - Masataka Taketsuru. The Pure Malt is one of best tasting whisky from Nikka Distillery which highlights the preciseness of blending whiskys. One of Nikka‚Äôs signature products to showcase the way of blending and perfecting flavors.   

&#x200B;

**The Bottle:** 

Like the other Nikka whisky bottle like the Miyagikyo, Coffee Grain, this whisky is contained in a round body bottle. Very simple round body bottle.  

&#x200B;

**The Opening:** 

Most of the Nikka Whisky uses plastic cap instead of a wood cork. They believe the plastic seal holds up better than the wood cork. Plastic seal caps also eliminates the posibilities of influence taste from the wood cork, wood cork rotting.  

&#x200B;

**The Color:** 

The color is very light amber, somewhat light Gold  

&#x200B;

**The Aroma, Nosing:** 

Very delicious, very inviting, fruity and malty nose. Very pleasing on nose, sweetness lingers and fades Bit apples, sweet citrus...  

&#x200B;

**The Taste - Neat:** 

Sweetness, sugar sweetness, a hint of tangerine, rich texture if you hold it in your mouth a bit. a hint of Vanilla fudge, its finish a bit of dryness, hint of smokey wood...   

&#x200B;

**The Strengths:** 

There a lot of respect for this whisky for the whisky forum. Due to its complex and very pleasing taste.  This is a very good whisky, a pride of Nikka due to complexity taste.   

**Price:**  CAD$80.00 (LCBO)  US$63.81 PHP4,299.00  700mL (Boozy.PH)   Should i buy this again:  Yes, absolutely... to this date, this is one of my favorite whisky.

First post‚Ä¶something different maybe?,"https://i.imgur.com/JFUsbE3.jpg

I‚Äôm new to whisk(e)y since a celiac diagnosis got me off of my beer drinking. I‚Äôve been enjoying it so far. This is a new whiskey from my home province of Nova Scotia. I am not much of a reviewer except to say it tastes good. This is from their website: 

‚ÄúNamed for a distinct piece of ironwork used on Bluenose II, forged by the blacksmith who worked in the building we inhabit now, Heart Iron Whisky is a step in a new direction for us. Fermented with two different strains of malted barley, one Canadian and a peated version from the UK, Heart Iron Whisky has spent three years in a pair of 200 Litre French oak barrels and is now a rich golden colour that simply glows. We opted to refrain from chill filtering, to keep the flavours from being diminished. Rich baking spices on the nose and essence of rich banana bread on the tongue make for a delicious taste experience. Try it neat with just a touch of water to expand the flavour.

The very first bottling sold out very quickly. And almost immediately was awarded a Gold Medal standing at the Canadian Artisan Spirits Awards. Our whisky will return to our shelves on International Whisky Day, March 27, 2021.‚Äù

Cheers folks.",
Possible reasons for a whisky losing its flavour in just a few weeks?,"A couple of weeks ago I was given a bottle of Loch Lomond 10 year old for my birthday. I was a big fan right from first dram, it was very sweet with notes of honey an dried fruit and a little smoke. However the last couple of drams I've had have been really flat; all the sweetness is gone, with nothing but a really 'generic whisky' flavour left, I.e a slightly smoky, slightly oaky, ethanol taste. It's really disappointing. 

I'm relatively new to whiskies so I don't really know the ins and outs of what causes their flavours to change. From what I can see online, they naturally change flavour over several months or a couple of years due to oxygen exposure and whatnot, but mine tastes totally different within a matter of just 2-3 weeks? I've drank barely a 3rd of the bottle, I haven't decanted it, I always put the cork back on right after pouring and it always sits in its box on the same shelf in my living room. I don't think it's me as nothing else is tasting different. 

I'm really at a loss as to what's changed, any ideas?","Well apart from chemical changes that may have had an impact on the whisky, do you reckon your own palate may have been affected? (factoring in for other major influences like prolonged exposure to sunlight, or your kids or whomever watering it down)

Covid can have quite profound and differing effects on people's ability to taste, especially when it comes to smell, and that can be a major factor in contributing to our sense of flavour. 

Your olfactory nerves may have been affected by this, and I know that different people have lost very specific aspects of taste (while not knowing they had covid) so have you tried any other neat alcohol, something with a whack of flavour, in comparison?

Hope you get to the root of it!

Also, might I suggest buying a 50cl mini from somewhere of the same whisky (if in UK try the whisky exchange) so you can try them side by side?
Funny you mention the change in taste a few weeks after a new bottle and being new whisky drinker. 

When I first started drinking whisky, all my taste buds were stimulated by the new flavours and nuances but after 3 weeks of drinking a few times a week it turned really flat. I‚Äôve combatted this by changing through the flavour tones by buying different Whisky‚Äôs as well as not drinking as frequently in a bid to reset my palate.
It's not even a stretch to say you might have COVID. If your house is extremely hot that could also play a part.
As I say I haven't noticed any other changes in taste from anything else I've eating or drank recently, and I haven't shown any other symptoms that so I don't believe it's due to any loss of taste. 

I actually tried to look for reviews online to see if this had occurred with any other bottles but it seems to be quite hard to find? My friends got it from Tesco but they don't have it advertised on their website, and it's not listed on the whisky exchange or master of malt. The only place I can see it is on the Waitrose website and they only have the full 70cl bottle.

I'll just have to keep experimenting to see what it could be. Maybe the temperature of the glass or the size of the dram poured? I really don't know, I haven't experienced this with any other whisky. Thanks for your suggestions though!
Hmm I hadn't considered that. I usually have dram 2 or 3 times a week, so it might be worth leaving it for a week or so and then come back to it, see if that makes any difference?

Good idea!
Interesting... the glass being ice cold, addition or water/ice etc would all be obvious things but I'm guessing you've already taken that into account. Hope you figure it out!
That‚Äôs sort of what happened to me drinking it about 3 time a week, then the drams got bigger etc. Now I drink maybe once a week and vary between 5 different whisky‚Äôs.

Edit: I‚Äôve also prefer or had prolonged enjoyment from Peaty-er whisky‚Äôs."
"Grabbed a couple more bottles last night. Excited to not only enjoy the taste of these, but also the experience of reviewing them. Auchentoshan: Three Wood and The Balvenie: Double Wood 12year",,"Holy shit, is 3 wood natural colour?
Honestly I am not sure. The website I use to determine that shows Auchentoshan 12 and 18 use E150. They do not show the triple wood. Based on other two results I can only assume Three Wood is using E150.  But damn it is such a sexy color. Lol
3 wood uses e150 to combat batch variation so sadly not natural.  It does taste like a well sherried whisky though with a cherry cola flavour very prominent (at least for me), it‚Äôs a very decent bottle.  The Balvenie on the other hand...well the less said the better."
The Curse of E150,"So I might be a few drams in, which is where the confidence for this post comes from. 

I was reading a review whilst sipping and there is constant mention of colouring and I just don't get why. I understand it seems a bit dishonest and like the distillery are compensating for something. For the article to preface their review with a comment suggesting as long as the whisky is good then why should they care, it frustrates me that all these ""whisky gods"" then comment on the colouring at every opportunity. 

I live very close by to the king of colouring so have always been exposed to their whisky but also really enjoy it. I truly live by the premise of if the liquid tastes good then who cares. 

I currently have around 70 opened bottles on the go at the moment and have tasted hundreds of different whisky's so I'm no stranger to the stuff, I've just never understood this snobbery. I'll try anything from Irish, to bourbon, to single malts and blends. I love the discovery of whisky and would kick myself if I turned something down because it used colouring. 

I would love to start an open discussion to gather people's thoughts, especially people that are in my camp but equally want to hear the side of people that steer clear of the dreaded E150! 

I'm now off to prepare myself for the onslaught of down votes. 

P.s. I hope I didn't break any community rules.","I'm a simple guy, if it tastes good then I'm happy. If anything, I'm more bothered by lack of age statements or anything that claims to be excellent by marketing or price tag or both...and is proofed down to 40%
I'd rather a whisky maker be proud of their product enough to present it without additions or adulteration. Ardbeg 10 comes to mind - it's only a few shades away from water but damn fine spirit.
Coloring is marketing - that's all that's wrong with it. Marketing sucks.

I don't turn my nose up at it, but given my choice between it and non-colored, ncf, I'll give my money to the guys who say, ""Judge our whisky on its tastes, not its look,"" rather than the guys who say, ""You all are stupid, so we made our whisky look like coca cola.'
I've met folks who claim they can taste the difference. I can't. I don't give a shit what color it is. I sort of like un-colored Scotches - they have such a vibe, being so light in color. But at the same time, it doesn't make or break a beverage for me at all. I love Talisker 10, and I'm sure that's pumped full of coloring. It's still a great whisky.
With basically any subjective experience you get people who obsess over the minutiae, when in reality neither they, nor anybody else could tell a difference in a blind test, which is all that matters. 

The true red pill for scotch is that age statements, distillery, brand, and so on until the end of time, none of it matters. All that matters is if it tasted good or not.
I‚Äôm generally in agreement with OP. I personally can‚Äôt taste the difference at all; so, to me, it feels similar to a nice restaurant that plates a fancy dessert with raspberry swirls on the plate & such ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt change the taste, just the appearance. 

I get that there‚Äôs an argument to be made for authenticity & unadulteration. And maybe my dessert analogy is more similar to using a nice bottle or box. But if there isn‚Äôt a negative effect (again, assuming you can‚Äôt taste the difference), then I don‚Äôt see a problem with it as long as the distillery doesn‚Äôt actively conceal its usage of e150.
[deleted]
I mean, I don‚Äôt even like that Crystal Light is colored. It‚Äôs not a matter of taste, I just don‚Äôt want to unnecessarily be drinking dye. It‚Äôs the most unnecessary addition to food.
If you really want to find out what additives are in your whisky, go to a German online store. They are required by law to tell you. I use whiskyzone.de
I love Glendronach, Talisker, Bowmore and probably a few others which have E150. The stats that are more important to me is whether it is filtered to hell and back or watered down under 46%. Those kill more flavor and mouth feel than E150 typically would.
I only judge whether or not I like a whisky by the merit of what's in the glass, and there are ones which I know have e150a added which are still good. To name a few, I would buy Lagavulin 16, Laphroaig 10, and Old Pulteney 12 again for sure despite them being coloured.

That being said, the argument against e150 is completely understandable, and I find myself ever more drawn towards naturally coloured whiskies, especially if there is also a combination of non chill filtration and a higher ABV. On average I just enjoy these drams more, even younger ones. An added age statement is preferential though. 

Besides the physical effects that things like no added e150 and no chill filtration may or may not have, that's not even the whole point, as it tells me a greater story about the bigger picture of a distillery or company that has an ingrained culture of ensuring that they produce the best possible quality, and honestly presented whisky for the customer. And that counts for a lot in my book and should garner more respect from whisky enthusiasts.
Do we have a list of whisky that used E150?
A few thoughts:

- It's just burnt sugar (you know what else is burnt sugar? The char/toast layers of a cask)

- Yes you can taste it in sufficient concentrations (which will only happen with careless blending)

- Ban it and producers will just rest the spirit in new oak or recharred casks for a couple of months which will do exactly the same thing.

- A *lot* of distilleries use a small amount just to ensure batch to batch consistency.

- Whisky fans know that a spirit aged in refill casks will be very pale, but the average consumer equates colour with age/quality. I've worked somewhere with a naturally pale straw coloured single malt, and it was literally the first comment 90% of people made about it (and not in a good way).
You saying we shouldn't judge a drink by its color? What's next, don't judge people by their color too? /S
I think you make very fair points. The truth is the colour, the age, of even the brand of whisky are never great indicators of quality. 

But for a long time they were! 

I also think people are suspicious of distilleries adding colour as it's a bit of a cheat. What else would they cut corners with? Ageing the spirit for ages in knackered barrels to get an old, but flavourless dram? Rapid fermentation? Poor quality new make etc.
Colouring hides the true colour of the whisky, the distillery is hiding something from the consumer. That is what I don‚Äôt like about it. I understand why it is used, and I try whiskies with colour in them but I have more respect for distilleries who are transparent with their consumers.
I could care less if coloring is added. As long as what's in the bottle tastes good, that's all that matters to me. I think Talisker Distiller's Edition is a fantastic pour, despite it's obvious added coloring. 

It's funny to see this post this morning - yesterday evening I had a pour of Loch Lomond 12 (say what you want about this bottle, but in my opinion it's a damn fine pour for \~$30) and my wife commented on how nice the color was on it. I began to explain to her that some distilleries added coloring to their scotch, and then proceeded to search the bottle to determine if that was the case. After a minute or so she said ""...Why do you care if there is coloring added? Didn't you say you like it?"". And she was absolutely right, and as I said, I agree with her sentiment, but for some reason a lot of folks out there have made such a fuss about it that I still find myself checking. Though I will say I was surprised to see that it is NCF. 

I've watched videos of different people testing the theory that it changes the taste, and as this post proves, opinions can vary. I'll say again, if the whiskey tastes good, why should we care?
I think you nailed it in the first paragraph... it‚Äôs a transparency issue for the most part. In a time when a lot of distilleries are try to be ultra transparent it seems to be a bit dishonest. I do find (whether it‚Äôs just in my head or not) that I prefer Un colored/ Un Chillfilterrd but that‚Äôs not a hard and fast take. I have really enjoyed many colored drams.
From what I have heard from distillers, it‚Äôs often a matter of creating consistency rather than straight up marketing. As in, if one pour of a Talisker looks lighter than a pour from another bottle, the average consumer might conclude that it is in some way flawed - even if the flavour profile is identical. 

On the other hand - this tendency has ruined the colour of whisky for me. It‚Äôs hard to appreciate the natural process of pigmentation when everything needs to be a flat, artificial brown.
Tbh I can‚Äôt taste the difference between w/ or w/o E150, not at all. To me the only reason opposing the use of E150 is all about how it‚Äôs taking away a fun part of the tasting experience. With coloring, it‚Äôs harder to assessing couple of things,

1) Cask types the liquid has gone through
2) The whisky‚Äôs age

I don‚Äôt care whether E150 is intended for marketing, consistent presentation or to confuse people with the content in the bottle, but to me that simply makes my whiskies less fun to talk about.
The lack of age statement doesn't really bother me, but I agree with the 40%. 

My opinion on the lack of age statement is the same as OP's opinion on coloring (which I share the same feelings on as well) - as long as the whiskey is good, I could care less about how old it is. Classic Laddie (though I believe this lacks an age statement for legal reasons, but I could be wrong) and several Ardbeg releases don't have an age statement, but are still fantastic in my book. Uigeadail is one of my favorite Islays and it lacks an age statement. 

But again, I agree with the 40%. To me if a company is going to proof down their whiskey to the legal minimum, they care more about making money than they do about putting out a quality, enjoyable product. When they're adding coloring they're *technically* putting more work/money into it, though I'm assuming the price/effort is minimal.
The low ABV and high tariffs of OB scotches in the US has kind of turned me away from it
I'm of two completely opposite minds on this.

On one hand coloring is dishonest, doesn't make it taste better, and therefor shouldn't be used. Of course. (I happened to have an Ardbeg 10 yesterday, and it is a glorious whisky regardless of colour.)

But on the other hand I think a darker whisky just looks better in a glass. I know it's fake and I know it's unnecessary, but I still think a darker shade gives the drink (the illusion of) more gravitas, which I don't think is meaningless when you just sit with a glass to enjoy it instead of analysing it.

So yeah, I think both diametrically opposite sides have their points.
This is the way I see it too, it‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt enjoy whisky that is colored and CF‚Äôd, it‚Äôs that we don‚Äôt like the practice, so we‚Äôd rather support distilleries, blenders and bottlers that are totally forthcoming about this, and let the spirit be judged on its naked merit. I happen to think many whiskies of a lighter shade look lovely.
The real problem is human nature! There are enough who think darker is better or more appealing. Look at all the fake colors added to food products. Do people even know what real food looks like? It must work cause so many things have fake coloring added (lots of snack foods, yogurt, etc). Another crazy marketing gimmick is all the perfumes added to cleaning products. I think people don‚Äôt even know what clean smells like due to marketing.

I still will drink some whiskies with e150 (like Laga) because I like the taste... so the marketers have figured out it doesn‚Äôt hurt them with people like me but helps them with people who like color. At least e150 is innocuous from a health standpoint.
This is exactly how I feel. laphroaig got me into peat, I still prefer it to any other peated expression I‚Äôve had especially their cask strength offering. Once I found they add e150 I haven‚Äôt bought another bottle, I‚Äôll go with and explore other distilleries that don‚Äôt. Also, not sure if it‚Äôs related, I used to get migraines bad, haven‚Äôt in a while, but when I would have laphroaig 8/10x I would get a headache/migraine. I typically have one maybe two light pours a night and this only happened with laphroaig, not sure if e150 took part in it. I doubt it but still worth questioning.
[deleted]
What you meant to say is ‚ÄúNone of it matters to me‚Äù - and somehow I got the feeling you don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs in your food either. Who cares about antibiotics, as longs as it tastes good, it doesn‚Äôt matter ..

Fine. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs still E150 in many whiskies, that‚Äôs why they are chill filtered etc. Many customers don‚Äôt care about anything at all, as long as the marketing tells you it tastes great, it tastes great and everything is fine.
I agree with feeling more groggy in the morning after an e150 whisky. Redbreast 12 is probably the smoothest and lowest proof malt in my current collection yet gives me the worst hangover.
E150 is made from cooking sugar, could be a resulting dehydration? But honestly I think by definition it's pretty chemically neutral. Maybe the drug that colors more is correlated with lower quality and that contributes?

I honestly don't think the coloring matters at all personally. There's definitely pedants in my life who call me out any time I fall for marketing (but Kaiyo's ocean journey is such *romantic* nonsense, though!)
I don't have access to every Glendronach bottle, but the three that I do have (12, 15 & 18) quite clearly say ""Non chill filtered - Natural Colour""
I always say, if it doesn't say natural colour on the bottle then it contains e150
I really hate the color of E150, it's a weird orange-ish color that looks unnatural when used in high quantities like in JW. And when used in small amounts such as laphroaig 10 it doesn't do anything...
I'm the opposite. I love how a neat pour of ardbeg looks like a chardonnay and tastes like a bonfire. The dichotomy is a real mind fuck and one of the reasons I like it so much.
""I do agree with you, generally, on not getting hung up on the minutiae of it, but things like age statements, distillery, brand, and so on do matter, insofar as at least telling the different whiskeys apart""

Yes this is true, but what I was getting at is that none of that stuff makes an inherently good or bad whisky. Being 99 years old and uncolored does not matter if it does not taste good. 

Likewise, having no age statement and colouring does not matter if it does taste good.
Yep. You are right. I could have sworn Glendronach was one of those that is great despite those things.  It would be nice if they put it on the bottle instead of just on the tube. My bottles say nothing about it. Lagavulin 16 is another one that people love despite the E150.
The Lagavulin 16 is quite special, you're right."
Black Friday Discounts,"Hello r/whisky! I posted a while ago about my project [https://theliquorproject.co.uk](https://theliquorproject.co.uk/), where I scan the web and find drops in prices for whiskies in the UK. I've been working on it quite a bit and would love to hear what the whisky community would like to see more, and where I should move from here.

For example, some things I've been thinking of:

- Being able to sign up for notifications when a particular whisky drops in price
- Giving reviews and tasting notes
- Seeing a ""top list"" of popular whiskies / trends
- Seeing a ""new list"" of new whiskies

Does any of these sound like something you would want? What is more important? Anything else you'd like to see? 

I'm building this for whisky lovers like myself, and I want this to be a tool for us in the community!

Also, since it is Black Friday there are quite a lot of drops in prices happening right now, so go in and check it out üòäüçª","I don't mean to be a downer - but some constructive criticism. 

I was astounded by the prices listed for Aberlour A'Bunadh - so I checked.

You seem to have scraped listings on Master of malt - all the way back to batch 20 - all of which show as discontinued and the (apparently) most recent batch - #63 is sold out but at ¬£83 - not the ¬£35 that it shows listings from.

It also has the main listing as ""Aberlour A'Bunadh Batch 20 - from ¬£34.61"" but the batch 20 in the listing is unavailable but also listed as ¬£250. Every other batch number is either unavailable or priced much higher. 

It gives a false impression of availability and price. 

`name=""product:price:currency"" content=""GBP"" /><meta name=""product:price:amount"" content=""34.61"" /><meta `

I assume that this part is where you pull the price from - which still shows in the page source - but it doesn't check whether the site (Master of Malt in this case) actually has the whisky in stock or whether it is generally available. Every Master of malt listing shows discontinued - except one listing for batch 63 which says ""sold out"" 

Also - from the 20 listings for A'Bunadh, there is a random bottle of Tullamore Dew.
Great find! I wonder what would be a good way to separate these ""batches"" of the same ""product"". Do you think it would make sense to treat them all as separate products completely? Also, would you prefer to not see ""discontinued"" listings at all, or separated from the rest of the products?

&#x200B;

And what happened to the Tullamore D.E.W... My matching involves a lot of guesswork, using the gtin / ean, name similarity etc. and sometimes the stores themselves use the wrong product code for their product listings.
Probably not separate products - I think they are adequately separated in the A'Bunadh page - maybe just refer to the whole lot as A'Bunadh instead of listing the earliest page it can find and including the batch 20 bit.

For the discontinued and sold out stuff - I'm sure that there is a way to scrape that detail from the page source too.


For batch 41 and I assume the other discontinued batches 

    <a id=""14247_button"" class=""mom-btn  mom-btn-buy is-disabled mom-btn-buy-large"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""#add""><div><div class='mom-btn-text'>Discontinued</div></div></a>

This Comes up when I view the page source (view-source:https//......) - not sure if it's useable to you.

For batch 63 which is sold out 

    <a id=""91593_button"" class=""mom-btn  mom-btn-buy is-disabled mom-btn-buy-large"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""#add""><div><div class='mom-btn-text'>Sold out</div></div></a>


I checked a few listings for other whisky which is definitely in stock and neither lines show up in the ""view page source"" for whiskies which are available.

Not sure if that helps or not, I'm not personally big on Web dev so I'm not sure how to follow it back to something more useful for you, or if I even can on mobile.

Personally, I'd like the discontinued batches to be separated - maybe like samples are separated - I'd also suggest that the sample price isn't considered for the lowest price on the main page.

I saw a ""Glen Elgin"" which said its lowest price was something like ¬£3.50 - I checked and it was definitely a sample bottle.

I think they should be kept together on the same page for ease of viewing - but as a separate list (samples, full bottles, sold out, discontinued) so that they can be viewed in the correct context and the main ""from price"" listed on the home page or the search reflects the full bottles.

It allows people to see price changes over time, it allows room for discontinued bottles to come back on the market - just because it's discontinued doesn't mean that some store can't find some stock of it, maybe in a collection?

At least that's how I'd want to handle it if I was any good at web dev and it was my project. 

I hope my ramblings make sense...
Awesome feedback, I really appreciate you taking the time!

I think it makes sense to separate out the discontinued editions, so they are pulled away from the listings that are actually available. I'll see what can be done to get that data.

> I saw a ""Glen Elgin"" which said its lowest price was something like ¬£3.50 - I checked and it was definitely a sample bottle. 


Currently, I show those ""Available from ¬£xxx"" as the cheapest option available for purchase, and since there are sometimes samples they will always be the cheapest listing. How else do you suggest showing this? The technically ""correct"" option would be to show ¬£/cl - but no one thinks in terms of cost per cl haha

Again, really appreciate your time üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If you can retrieve the discontinued or sold out status from each site then I'd put a separate list like how the samples and regular bottles are separated - I'm not sure whether a simple ""unavailable"" section would be best or if it would require distinction of discontinued and sold out. 

With the unavailable bottles excluded from the list that price is taken from. 

[Glen Elgin Page](https://i.imgur.com/72R9PMs.jpg)

I'd personally prefer taking the ""Available from ¬£xxx"" purely from the regular bottle list rather than the least money paid to get any amount of the whisky. 

But I suppose ""what is a regular bottle"" gets into semantics. Not many distilleries have multiple bottle sizes but those that do can throw off the pricing a bit and I wouldn't want to bother separating them all.

I have what might be called a sample bottle, but it's 20cl vs <5cl, I wouldn't call it a regular bottle but it would appear out of place in a samples list.

And then some bourbons come in really small bottle sizes - 50cl is apparently the standard size for Manhattan bourbon but it often comes in 35cl bottles - if your site only considers 70cl to be standard then they'd get missed by my suggestion. 

I'd possibly show the ""Available from"" as the cheapest regular bottle with the list ordered as ¬£/cl to allow for visibility of larger bottle sizes."
Whisky Pictures,"I'm kind of disappointed to say, but I feel like most of the recent posts would be more fitting on r/whiskyporn. While it's great to see your bottles, I think others would also like to know what they taste/smell like, not just ""It's good!""

www.whiskeyamateurs.com and you can get some Whiskey Reviews
I feel this sub is pretty flavour profile orientated. Sure there‚Äôs often some ‚Äòarty‚Äô photos but that‚Äôs generally in addition, rather than being instead of, a thorough review.
Probably not the best time to promote :)
My shit isn‚Äôt taking photos and posting it... just about real people drinking whiskey and judging to the best of our ability as amateurs
I hear ya.  Just saying this sub doesn't respond well to blind promotion.  I used to do it too a few years ago.  Ill check out your podcast though :)

Oddly sweet after brushing my teeth,"So I brushed my teeth, my wife is out with the girls, and decided to relax with some Jim Beam (not my preferred bourbon, but fits my budget right now) and I am finding it almost too sweet to drink. I should note that I use an unsweetened mint toothpaste with clay. Has anyone else experienced this? 

Note: when I say too sweet I mean this bourbon is neat and tastes as sweet as if you put double your normal amount of splenda in your coffee","Each bottle can vary from minor differences to major, but one of the biggest factors is your palate. What you ate/drank recently, and certainly how you‚Äôve impacted your tongue.

Your taste buds are most sensitive in the morning (which is why your breath seems the worst) and the least in the evening. So I‚Äôd imagine brushing had a major impact on how you tasted the Beam, as it would with any food/drink.

I try to balance drinking whiskey with eating something bland (such as almonds or a bread) or something complimentary (chocolate, for example).

Try to avoid extremes (mint, spicy, etc.) before imbibing, and hopefully it will taste better next time.

What else do you enjoy drinking?
One of my good friends swears by drinking whisky after brushing teeth. He loves it. I've tried it and I don't mind it but def not as wowed as he is"
[Whisky Review] Kilchoman Machir Bay. Not my dram...notes in comment,,"I've had the pleasure of enjoying Machir bay a sunny afternoon at the beach in Machir Bay. That was an awesome experience! Kilchoman is probably one of my favorite Islay distilleries at the moment, so I would second the recommendations to try some of their other expressions.

My favorite, so far, is their sauternes cask finnish. Sweet and smokey!
This got me in to Kilchoman big time, lovely pineapple citrus lightness to go with the non overwhelming peat
This was a very pretty bottle, but it feels like too much effort was spent on what the bottle looked like and not what went into the bottle. For an Islay scotch, it didn‚Äôt have that nice smoke and peat depth that I‚Äôve come to expect from my Islay (like in Laphroaig or Lagavulin). It has the barest hint of wood fire and then tastes like someone tripped over it with a bucket of seawater. This is not one of the distillery‚Äôs better offerings. For $50 a bottle (along with 2 glencairn glasses) it‚Äôs definitely on the more affordable end of single malt scotch. I hope this will develop better as the distillery ages, knowing that this is among the younger distilleries on that distinguished island. I would not buy this again and would recommend others to splurge a bit more $$$ for one of Kilchoman‚Äôs other bottles.
Haven‚Äôt had that one before. I‚Äôll give it a try if I come across it
I had the exact same experience a couple of days ago. It's a great touch for the distillery to run their tastings on the beach. It wasn't my favourite dram of the four, but all were excellent and left a great impression of the distillery.
This is indeed quite a popular bottle among scotch drinkers. I guess I just fall into the minority group here. There were some members of my whisky club who really enjoyed this bottle. Cheers
Upvoted you but cannot disagree more. It's got a nice balance of smoke/peat and salt. Yes it's saltier than most but I feel that's what's lacking for most Islays, the salt. 

If you like smoke and brine, this should be a must try. 

On another note, Loch Gorm is fantastic!
""For an Islay scotch, it didn‚Äôt have that nice smoke and peat depth that I‚Äôve come to expect from my Islay"". Firstly Islay is a region not a style. Islay scotch does not have to involve any peat at all never mind the level you clearly like. There are great scotches from Islay that don't have any peat such as Bruichladdich and Caol Ila. Similarly there are great scotches from other regions that do involve peat such as Longrow, Ledaig, Balvenie and even Glendronach.  What you are really saying is you like peat smoke and this didn't have enough for you, which is a perfectly valid opinion. Embrace the variety, even the Islay distilleries don't want to spend all their time making peat bombs.
Yeah, as my first offering from Kilchoman I gotta say, machir bay did not leave me searching for more. Got another of theirs that could change my opinion?
For me it's something certainly Islay but different. I love Bowmore for this too.
You‚Äôre right, I don‚Äôt think I want too much brine. I prefer how most of the other Islay scotch taste. Ardbeg is about as briny as I‚Äôll take. I‚Äôll have to give loch gorm a try.
Lol ok alpha. Way to focus on one sentence out of my review just to shoehorn in your mansplaining. Nobody said anything about not liking any other styles of scotch nor that I was unaware of what Islay offers. If you bothered to comprehend the rest of my short review, I stated I didn‚Äôt enjoy this particular bottling because it was a peated scotch and the balance (to me) is off, which can happen even while I‚Äôm aware that other types of scotch exist. I‚Äôm not even hating on this distillery since I also suggest trying the other offerings from Kilchoman that I do enjoy.
Sanaig is an interesting bottle
I second Sanaig is great
Third. Also, Loch Gorm 2020 is excellent."
Good quality whisky for new drinkers?,"Hey! 

So my boyfriend‚Äôs 18th birthday is coming up soon (18 is legal drinking age here in Aus) and from the experience he‚Äôs had with alcohol previously, he‚Äôs quite a fan of whisky. 

I want to get him something that is nice enough quality but actually tastes good too. I‚Äôve done some reading and asked some novice whisky drinkers I know and potentially narrowed it down to three varieties, Starward (I‚Äôve been told nova is better than solera; both are award winners but solera seems to be a more recent winner but lower reviews?), Lark and Sullivan‚Äôs cove. There are different specific ones under each brand label and I‚Äôd be willing to explore any of them. 

My boyfriend isn‚Äôt a huge fan of overly smokey or sweet flavours as a whole (not specific to whisky). I‚Äôm looking to try and find a smooth single malt that might suit him. Any suggestions are welcome, especially any specific to the three brands I‚Äôve listed. 

Also I would absolutely taste them myself and try and pick but I‚Äôm not the hugest fan of alcohol - everything tastes a bit gross to me. 

+ assume price isn‚Äôt a factor

Thanks so much :)

Update: thank you all for your responses, you have given me a lot to think about, I‚Äôll do some more reading and let you know what I‚Äôm thinking if you‚Äôre interested!

Update 2: I have gone with the Glenmorangie 18 - I managed to slip him some in a blind testing and he really liked it so I know it‚Äôll go down well. I think the 18/18 pairing suites. Thank you to everyone who took the time to give me recommendations; I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll come back to this post to find future whiskies he might like too :)","If you‚Äôre just starting, Glenlivet 12 is a great entry point.  Glenmorangie 10 is sweeter, and also very good.  Both won‚Äôt break the bank but will not disappoint in the flavor department.

If this is a new thing for the both of you, sample, sample, sample.  Whisky can be a very expensive hobby and there‚Äôs nothing more disappointing than dropping potentially hundreds on a bottle only to be disappointed by how it tastes.

Figure out a reasonably-priced ‚Äòdaily drinker‚Äô first that he (and maybe you!) will like, and then you can branch out from there and be a bit more adventurous.

Best wishes to you both!
After trying almost every commercially available Scottish distillery‚Äôs malts, Bunnahabhain 12, Deanston 12, Clynelish 14 and Edradour 10 are probably the only non peated (smokey) flagship whiskies I would buy again. Clynelish and Edradour are a little more ‚Äúchallenging‚Äù (unique, nuanced) but Bunnahabhain and Deanston are more crowd pleasers. Bunnahabhain more salty, Deanston is slightly more sweet, but neither are too sweet like popular Speysides or some of the recommendations above (do NOT get Monkey Shoulder or any bourbons like Maker‚Äôs - they will be sickly sweet. People just recommend them because they are the common intro ones, but they are truly awful).
Hi there from a UK-based Aussie! I love that you're considering looking for Aussie whiskies for his birthday.

If you think he would like Starward, and you have your heart set on an Aussie whisky, I would also suggest looking at Timboon Distillery's Port Expression. It is lovely. Although its a bit on the sweeter side as whiskies go, it's in the same ballpark as Starward. 

If price isn't a factor and you want an Aussie whisky that will be a real conversation piece, you could also look at the single cask releases from Dark Valley Whisky - an independent bottler who buys and bottles casks from a broad variety of Australian distilleries - you can buy direct from [their website](https://www.darkvalleywhisky.com/our-whisky/) ...full disclosure, I am a friend of the founder, but I'm not plugging them for no reason - they won best non-scotch independent bottler at the 2019 Independent Bottlers Challenge.  Their releases are at cask strength, so much higher ABV (sometimes up around 66%!), and he might want to add a bit of water when drinking - these may be a bit much for a relative novice. 

A good place to have a browse (and also buy) Scotch whisky if you opt for non-aussie whisky would be Nick's Wine Merchants. They have a great online shop and probably the best range of Scotch whiskies available online in Aus (lots of great expressions you can't pick up at Dan's, BWS or Liquorland). 

If he doesn't like smoky flavours, steer clear of Islay whiskies. 

If you're looking for something with an age to match his, have a look at something like the [Glenallachie 18 year old](https://www.nicks.com.au/glenallachie-18-year-old-single-malt-scotch-whisky-700ml) the [Glenfiddich 18 year old] (https://www.nicks.com.au/glenfiddich-18-year-old-single-malt-scotch-whisky-700ml) or the [Glen Grant 18 year old](https://www.nicks.com.au/glen-grant-18-year-old-single-malt-scotch-whisky-700ml) all classics and lovely bottles that will still be enjoyed by someone relatively new to whisky. 

If the whisky being 18 years old isn't a huge drawcard, he might like something like this [22 year old Linkwood from Cadenheads small batch which doesn't have a whoppingly high ABV] (https://www.nicks.com.au/1995-cadenheads-small-batch-linkwood-22-year-old-cask-strength-single-malt-scotch-whisky-700ml) or this [Craigellachie 17 year old] (https://www.nicks.com.au/craigellachie-17-year-old-single-malt-scotch-whisky-700ml). 

It is also worth mentioning that given he's just starting out, it may be that he needs to try a few cheaper, ""every day"" whiskies to develop his palate before he really gets stuck into a special birthday bottle. The Aussie whiskies would be good for this.

Best of luck! And happy to discuss more.
[deleted]
Bruichladdich classic laddie is a great entry whisky
Also I second that Bruichladdich
I hiiiiiiighly recommend the Archie Rose Rye Malt! It's from Sydney and just won best Rye. It has a beautiful floral/spice flavour and comes in a really nice display box. I'd say it's super friendly for beginners whilst also being quite distinct. For an Aussie deluxe whiskey it's a good price.

Starward is good but if someone is quite new to whiskey, it can still have a pretty complex taste that might benefit from a palate that's seen a few more whiskies.
Jefferson Reserve Small Batch. $40-50. Readily available. Good neat, with a cube, or a splash of water. It‚Äôs my go to ‚Äúcheap‚Äù social bourbon.
Starward is very interesting. Good but special. Only go for it if you know somewhat what you are doing and he have seemed to like it before. If you are going for it, go Nova instead of Solera (personal pref.)

Now for some cool single malts while straying away from the sweet and Smokey:

Monkey shoulder - blended scotch and really excellent for its price point. I just stocked one myself and it‚Äôs probably one of the cheapest but still a stable in my collection. 

Glengoyne 18 or 25. Both are pricy but solid from what you get. Distillery is mostly done by hand, hence the price point. 18 is a bit more spicy and the 25 resembles a Christmas cake with cardemomme

Whistle pig 10 - not a scotch but a bourbon. Apples on the nose and minty chocolate on the palate. Super smooth. 

JURA 18 - weird to describe but I get cornflakes on the palate. 

If you want to convince him of something smokey go for lagavulin 16 or ardbeg uigeadail. 

Good luck and hope it helps.
Jura 10 or Jura journey. Mystery pick - Robert Burns Single Malt.
Enjoy!
Talisker 10 might be a good option. Although it has a bit of smoke, you get a bunch of delicious sugar and salty notes. This may be his gateway into Islay üòâ
Personally I started on (and still have when I'm out) Laphroaig 10 year old. Canny go wrong with it imo, and it's not too pricey.
[deleted]
Since you are in the UK, there is a great site with samples. Its [Whiskay.com](https://Whiskay.com), go to tasting boxes. I live in the US, and they dont ship here, but looks like a great idea for someone starting out and wanting to try different scotches. The prices dont seem to bad for what you get, and a lot of these whisky's are hard to find in minis.
Also recommended Glenmorangie 10. A fantastic dram ü•É
Good advice. One option could be to buy home a selection of miniatures so you could taste them and compare to help narrow down what he likes best.
I‚Äôve heard Glenmorangie is quite good too, I‚Äôll check out the 12yr. I‚Äôm thinking sampling may be a good option, could always go big for the 21st when I know what he likes :)
‚Äúdo NOT get Monkey Shoulder... truly awful‚Äù

Ooh, controversial
Will definitely keep this in mind thank you!
I was looking at an Aussie one given he is born and raised. I quite like the idea of matching 18 and 18 if possible!! I‚Äôll check out both of the websites, I appreciate you being so transparent on your involvement on the one. Thank you for sharing your expertise :)
Hi thank you so much for giving me such useful insight! If you didn‚Äôt see my update, I went with the Glenmorangie 18yr, which I did buy from Nick‚Äôs as I really appreciated the time you took! Hope you‚Äôre well :)
On my list, thank you!
I‚Äôll check it out!
Thanks so much!
Thank you for your input! Good to hear the Nova > Solera is a shared preference, it helps me narrow that potential choice down a bit! I might try and get him into some of the more smokey ones a little further down the line, I just don‚Äôt want to put him off of it right away.
Thank you!
Trying to stay away from smoke without losing depth for the first one but I‚Äôll keep it in mind!
OP mentioned BF isn't a fan of overly smokey flavors. Probably best to avoid something as smokey and polarizing as Laphroaig without having tried it or something similar first.
Heard quite a bit about Glenmorangie, I‚Äôll be checking it out. This gives me some breadth, thank you for your input!
I‚Äôm in Australia but I‚Äôm looking at tasting options based on some of the responses I‚Äôve gotten (including this one) thanks so much!
Will keep it in mind!!
Seems like this might be a good move :) thank you
Not when you consider that she said he doesn‚Äôt like sweet whiskies ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Monkey Shoulder is a sweet Speyside blend that was specifically designed to be used in cocktails. It‚Äôs certainly not a nice whisky to be given as a gift for somebody‚Äôs birthday.
Thanks for the update, that is a fine dram. Glad you managed to do some sneaky research with the blind tasting too, well done!
It‚Äôs fairly cheap at about ¬£40 a bottle, it might not be the same in Australia though. It‚Äôs very fresh and it‚Äôs a whisky you can drink at anytime/occasion. I‚Äôve yet to hear anyone complain about the taste and as the name suggests it is a total classic whisky. 

They usually have a code on the back of the bottle which you can input into the bruichladdich website and it‚Äôll tell you about the particular cask that your bottle has come out of.
Good luck! :)
Sorry I read he was a fan. Best leave the Laphroaig then. Apologies
That‚Äôs alright, thank you for your input, if he ends up liking smokey flavours I‚Äôll come back to this one :)"

\#33 **Mackmyra Appelblom (46.1%) (Swedish Single Malt)**

Well, this one sounds like ‚Äúapple bloom‚Äù so maybe that‚Äôs what it is supposed to taste like.

**Nose**: Honey, vanilla, and a dark note‚Ä¶ kind of a bread, yeasty smell. Very hard to pinpoint these odd smells. Maybe some apricot in there, too. Friendly nose, fairly interesting.

**Taste**: Sweet and sour. Some spices and another taste I can‚Äôt place, sort of fruity.

**Finish**: Pretty spice, easy drinking, and the same interesting fruity taste. Could be apricots, come to think of it. I‚Äôll take a look at what other folks have said to see if I‚Äôm all wet.

**Overall**: This is quite nice. It is probably very expensive, and made from unobtanium, but it‚Äôs a nice whisky. Oh! of course! I forgot the name of the whisky. The fruit I was smelling and tasting is probably supposed to be‚Ä¶ Apple! Price point for this liquid‚Ä¶ yes, I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd find it around here.

I made a very simple tasting notes app to encourage myself to enjoy my drinks more!,,"‚ÄúThe makers have left their mark‚Äù haha i love it
Android link:  [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.genvisoftware.tastingnotes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.genvisoftware.tastingnotes)

If a post like this is not appreciated, please take it down.

I made the app because I would like to see some new people discovering the app and instead of only focussing on taste that they will also try to focus on color, smell and other information like distillery or region.

This app surely isn't for the die-hard tasters that would like functions such as star graphs but more for those who are just entering the world of whiskey (or other drinks).

Another reason to go for such an abstract design is to provide a single app for whiskey, gin, wine and maybe even coffee, because there are a lot of apps for tasting that only focus on one drink.
Looks great, do you have an apple version too?
Distiller is a great app for this purpose. Also includes a few other spirits other than just whisky. Great for searching and also allows you to have your own list.
I use an App called ‚ÄúDrammer‚Äù for this and it lets you add photos - good work tho

Kilchoman...,Been looking at this whisky for an hour or so online. Anybody tried it? Do you agree with the tasting notes?,"The Machir Bay is well worth your time.
You need to be more specific, they have many expressions. The Loch Gorm 2019 is fantastic IMO.
Awesome distillery. I‚Äôve only had a few expressions of theirs but they have all been good. I just reviewed the 2019 STR Cask release over on r/scotch
My favourite core expression is the Sanaig, but they did a fantastic limited edition for Milroy's of Soho...
I've had the Machir Bay, Sanaig and one of the 100% Islay releases and they've all been lovely drams. Whichever one you're looking at my advice is to pull the trigger. Kilchoman won't let you down.
I loved the Sanaig. I am currently drinking the limited edition single cask and so far I like it, but I wouldn't buy it again at the price I paid (88 EUR). The tasting notes on the bottles seem accurate, if that's what you were referring to.
I visited Islay and all its distilleries in 2019. Kilchoman had the most authentic tour and pretty good whisky.

But I find the pricing a bit too much. For those prices you simply can get better whisky...
I have a couple of their bottles and I‚Äôm impressed.  Grab the original cask strength if you can
Wonderful stuff. They are fairly new though, so I think they have slightly higher prices than you‚Äôd expect, since they‚Äôre still paying off start up costs, it seems. Can‚Äôt stress it enough though: really nice Islay malt, and a cool distillery to get to know while they‚Äôre new.
I would whole heartedly recommend the Sanaig. It is my favourite sherry cask + peat whisky and all people I have served it to have said it is one of the best whiskies they have tasted
Picture Lagavulin but younger, brighter, slightly more citrusy. -Machir Bay
It is a whisky for drink...that is all.
Seconded
Any of their core range. It‚Äôs not a distillery I‚Äôve sampled in the past.
Thanks! It‚Äôs a bit of what I was referring to, I haven‚Äôt yet sampled any of their produce and was looking for some real world feedback!
I tend to agree, but their limited releases are very appealing and typically pretty great. 

I have the STR Cask and the Sauternes matured. The STR is fantastic and I've heard good things about the Sauternes but I still need to open it up."
Been done a million times but here's my little review of Jack Daniel's classic No7. Cheers everyone ü•É,"Jack Daniel‚Äôs old no7

¬†by¬†Big Dram Man

JD is one of the most iconic brands in the world, made at the Jack Daniels distillery located at Lynchburg Tennessee and Founded in 1866 by Jasper Newton Daniel, more commonly known as Jack! Although the brand likes to make a point of being a ‚ÄòTennessee Whisky‚Äô on account of its production location and filtration through maple charcoal (10 feet of it), it does also fall under the broader categorisation of a bourbon (people love to argue over this!).

Jack Daniel‚Äôs boasts some well known drinkers including Frank Sinatra and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones.
Being such an iconic whiskey I thought it would be rude for me not to review it, and give my thoughts on the classic JD old no7.

On the nose:¬†Slightly astringent at first then Mcdonalds¬†Banana milkshake, wood glue, cinnamon candy, oak and hints of smoke.¬†
Nose: 15/25

On the palate:¬†Artificial banana, sweet corn, caramel, vanilla, charred oak, maple syrup. Nice tasting but leaves you wanting something more.¬†
Palate: 16/25

The finish:¬†Short to medium. sweet caramel, liquorice, coffee, pepper spice and oak as it fades.
Finish: 13/25

Price&Branding:¬†Priced at around ¬£20 ($20 in the US) its versatile and branded so well that it‚Äôs hard to drop points on the no7, but I have tried other JD products that give a bit extra for a small price increase.¬†
Price&Branding: 22/25

Total: 66/100

Final thoughts:¬†The no7 is one of the top selling brands in the world for a couple of reasons, it‚Äôs not complex or a challenge so it appeals to the masses, and it‚Äôs one of the best for mixing with. Jack Daniel‚Äôs has a few fantastic offerings for the more experienced Connoisseur amongst us, and the distillery itself is well worth a visit if the opportunity arises. No7 isn‚Äôt great, it isn‚Äôt what most people would call a sipping whiskey, but it also isn‚Äôt bad and has been the gateway for a lot of people, I don‚Äôt know many people that drink whiskey that hasn‚Äôt tried it. It‚Äôs a party whiskey, one to enjoy with whiskey drinking friends, and non whiskey loving friends alike. It gets a lot of stick but it will hold a special place in my heart, just not always in my glass!

https://bigdrammanwhisky.home.blog/2020/06/28/jack-daniels-old-no7/","Jack Daniels was my first American whiskey and I was surprised how good it didn‚Äôt taste, considering all the hype I‚Äôd heard about it.  A few years later my brother was getting into whisky and talked me into trying it again, this time in ginger ale. It wasn‚Äôt half bad. 

As a natural rye drinker I‚Äôm not big on bourbon anyway, but if I found myself at an American party with no rye in sight, I think I could make it through on Jack & ginger
Fuck I hate being Australian. Jack daniels old number 7 is $50 here. Do we have a better price point on scotches? Balvenie doublewood is $90 and Oban 14 is $110. Still cheaper than my favourite Australian Whisky I guess, limeburners sherry cask is $140 :/.

I think though we mostly just suffer on the cheaper ones due to our $35ish per 700mil excise on 40ish% spirits regardless of their price. Goes up the higher alcohol percentage though so we suffer hard on cask strengths too. Theres a very nice looking cask strength glenlivet sherry butt I want to order but at $270.....
For years I never drank whiskey because of Jack Daniels. It was the first that I ever tried, and I hated it so much. I've assumed ever since then all American whiskies tasked like JD. It wasn't until a couple years ago I realized that wasn't the case. 

I tried some JD a couple months ago....still can't stand the stuff. Thankfully, there's a whole world out there besides them, eh?
I think this is about where I would rate JD as well. It's certainly very popular, especially in the US, but I find it a mandatory mixer with Coke rather than a good sipper. For the price that's really not a bad thing and unless it's a really good whiskey, I'm a mixer anyway.
I refuse to drink it. JD no. 7 was originally 90 proof.
Ginger ale is great, I quite like it with root beer too! üòÇ
The prices are a bit steeper in Australia, you guys get hit harder than most for tax, its probably cheaper to buy Australian wine in the UK!
It's all personal preference, Jack Daniel's is most people's first experience with American whiskey. People are becoming increasingly curious and trying other brands thankfully! My first experience with scotch was bells, put me off for years! üòÇ
Root beer??  I never would have thought if that.  Ok, I‚Äôll try it!
Wine is actually not taxed that much. Most (700mil) bottles are around the $10-15 mark. You're getting real good wine if you pay much more (or overpaying). Obviously real premium or collectable wines the sky is the limit though but just an everyday drop like my favourite, Devil's Lair sauv blanc is $10 usually.

People want to change this because alcholics drink of choice is usualy 5l boxes of wine for like $20. Stupid idea though, tax doesn't stop alcoholics just makes them poorer.

>My first experience with scotch was bells



Mine was Famous Grouse. I was 19. I didn't touch whisky again until I was 28. It really was that bad!
Bourbon and root beer is an actual thing, somebody put me in that direction and it's actually really good! If it's hot outside top it with a bit of vanilla ice-cream to get the full effect! üòã
Rootbeer is a great mixer with sweeter whiskeys but those with a high wood tannin content will be really bitter and not very enjoyable if you aren't into bitter drinks IMO.
Totally agree with you, I don't believe high tax stops alcoholics. Just makes our wife's more angry when they find out how much the latest bottle cost!
 I don't think a laphroaig would have captured my taste back then either to be fair, definitely think my taste has changed over the years..... I've been eating Brussel sprouts and olives now for about 15 years! üòÇ"
"1/3 off in my local supermarket, worth a go! Anyone got any tasting notes?",,"No tasting notes, but is a darn good dram for the price. think I managed to get it for ¬£25.
It's one of the major contributors to the Johnnie Walker canon. Decent drop
Yup, generally drops to around 25 in morrisons on a regular basis, and well worth it. A good solid whisky you should enjoy
No tasting notes but again a good dram for around ¬£25. I find a small drop of water brings a bit more taste out of it but worth testing to your own tastes
The last dram I had of it was quite wonderful, I am however almost teetotal and hadn't had any alcohol in 3 months.
Have the 12yo here. How does it compare to that?"
Old pulteney 15 year old,"I‚Äôve got a few bottles on the go at the minute. I often find once opened, a bottle changes on the palette and the whisky develops quite a bit over time...I can‚Äôt recall what my tasting notes were on this particular whisky when it was first opened. But it is absolutely lush and well balanced this evening, just wanted to share that. Sl√°inte","Glad to hear this. I‚Äôve heard of the new OB‚Äôs of OP‚Äôs, the 15 is quite good. Its on my list. Cheers.
Just finished another bottle of the 12, keep meaning to order some of their older range. 

For the money I think the 12 is pretty exceptional, if it was called Glensomething or something unpronounceable in Gaelic I think it would be a lot more common and popular.
Absolutely. I find the OP and Bunnahabhain quite similar. A little salty and soft caramel notes. Tasty stuff. 
Totally agree on the glensomething point...although I have just broken my own rule and bought a Glenmorangie...it‚Äôs the Quinta ruban though, I expect good things!"
40th birthday line-up. About 3 years collecting these beauties. Happy to share any tasting notes if anything catches your eye.,,"Happy birthday! Mine was Tuesday. Which is your favorite and tasting notes as well?
What do you think of the Nikka FTB? Likely thinking about getting a bottle next time I see it as I like Japanese and am interested to see what the extra proof could do to it.
Jealous of the Glen Scotia! Congratsü•É
Happy Birthday! You need more Irish whiskey, if you need any recommendations I'm happy to share :-)
hello man, i have specifically logged in i think first time in forever to congratulate on the PORT CHARLOTTE CC:01. i have just finished mine.

How is the glen scotia rum one? I am considering buying this right now.
Thanks! It was actually December, but I'm just trying to catch up on here and share my collection with those I am learning from. Happy birthday to you too. 
Favourite is difficult. 
The Uigeadail is the most intense experience. I stated off the whisky journey about 6 years back falling for Lagavullin 16. Then progressed to Ardbeg 10 and then on to the Uigeadail. 
I love the peat blast, but there's so much going on I find it almost overwhelming, I can't quite break down the individual flavours. 
A colleague bought me that Red Breast, before I had even heard of it and I have to say it is one of the most drinkable and enjoyable drams I've had. I tore through that bottle in less than 3 months and have since replaced it, which is not my usual style. 
Nikka from the Barrel is no secret, but I do love it. Complex and ever enjoyable, tastes more expensive than it is. 
I live in france, near the border with Switzerland and Italy. Just under Mont Blanc, on the other side of the Italian border is a brilliant albeit idiosyncratic liquor store with a great range of whiskies. I got that bottle of Komagatake there and I'm really enjoying it expanding my palate and my horizons at the same time. 
The Glen Scotia is absolutely solid and right in my taste, as is the Port Charlotte. Both brilliant gifts from friends that know exactly what I like. 
The three Scottish Malt Whisky Society bottles in the background are superb too - my introduction to independent bottling and each one a gem. 
I guess I don't have a favourite as such. 
Depending on the moment, I have a taste for really different bottles and I'm trying to broaden my tastes even further.
Love it. On to my third or fourth continuous bottle now. It's rich and complex and really benefits from the extra strength but is in no way harsh. Neat or with a drop of water, it is head and shoulders the best blend I have tasted.
Thanks. It's my first bottle and its a beaut. 
Had a visit to Campbeltown planned before lockdown. 
Hope to get there before too long.
I do. The red breast was a present from an Irish colleague and it was my first taste of pot still. I was pretty blown away to be honest, it's fantastic. Have bought more and will do again. I'd love some more recommendations on what to explore please. Generally I like big flavours and strong tastes, but I am trying to educate my palate to be a bit more nuanced and subtle.
The Port Charlotte was a gift from a good friend who knows my tastes very well. He's pretty knowledgeable too, even has a share in a cask of Bruichladdich on its way to maturity. 
The Glen Scotia was another present - I guess i have some pretty good friends. It is delicious, strong and smokey with plenty of peat but the rum finished makes it round and complex. You can taste the cask strength but without the burn of alcohol. I would recommend it.
Try Yellow Spot - To me it is one of the best Irish whiskeys going. Very similar flavor profile to Redbreast also. 

If you like big flavor then you could try Connemara, it is one of the only peated Irish available.
Great, thanks a lot for this. I'll give them both a try when I can. If I manage any time soon, I'll let you know what I think."
"My little lockdown review of Lagavulin 16, cheers everyone! ü•É","Lagavulin 16 year scotch.

¬†by¬†Big Dram Man

Bottled at 43%vol and aged for 16 years. Located on the southern coast of the island of¬†Islay, Lagavulin roughly translated from the Gaelic lag a‚Äômhuilin, which means ‚Äúhollow by the mill‚Äù. Records show that there was illicit distillation on the site of what is now the Lagavulin Distillery since 1742, but the actual Lagavulin distillery itself wasn‚Äôt started until 1816.

At the 2017 San Francisco World Spirits Competition, Lagavulin‚Äôs 16-year Scotch was named¬†the Best Distiller‚Äôs Single Malt and won a double gold medal. Lagavulin 16 is also one of the six whiskies that make up the Diageo¬†Classic Malts of Scotland series.

On the nose:¬†The meaty smoke greets you before the glass is even in your hand! Smoked ham and fish, salty maritime air, mild antiseptic, orchard fruits, lemon zest, oak, leather and hints of white pepper, vanilla and toffee. With a little water the smoke takes a back seat and I find some more fruits like strawberrys and raspberrys.¬†
The nose: 22/25

On the palate:¬†Burnt butterd toast and Barbecue ash quickly give way to salty cured meats, mixed berries, mild antiseptic, tobacco, touch of oak, vanilla, lemon and toffee. water brings some more maritime salty notes, more fruits and some waxy nuts. Not the most complex but balenced on a knife edge!¬†
Palate: 23/25

The finish:¬†long and lingering finish, white pepper, dark chocolate and a touch of tobacco, leather and oak. With water the salt and fruit tag along for a while longer.
¬†Finish: 20/25

Price/Branding:¬†Priced around ¬£50 in the UK ($80 for my friends in the US) a 16 year old single malt scotch of this quality is great value. Actor, comedian and Scotch whisky enthusiast Nick Offerman has used Lagavulin in his show, and he has created some great YouTube adverts for the brand, I will leave a link of my favourite at the bottom of this review.¬†
Price&Branding: 25/25

Total: 90/100

Final thoughts:¬†Although not my favourite whisky from the big distilleries on Islay, I still love this bottle. The 16 years has rounded and balanced it out nicely. If I‚Äôm introducing someone to a heavly peated whisky then this would be test before I picked up the earthy Ardbeg or madicenal Laphroaig.

https://bigdrammanwhisky.home.blog/2020/05/17/lagavulin-16-year-scotch/

Nick Offerman video:https://youtu.be/HENOfXtjhh4","Definately one of my favourites, I will need to try Ardbeg next.
There is a path to follow for good whisky and you're bound do walk by this one or you'll have missed some of the best sights along the way.
It is liquid bacon. Truly amazing stuff.
Great review! Dont see too many people rating the nose/taste/finish on a number system individually, and i wish they did. I envy you guys in Europe, all the best prices on scotch. I cant find a bottle of Laga under $100 in the twin cities (texas, usa) right now
I think the Ardbeg fits my preferences a little more than the Lagavulin, hits a little harder. Although the Laphroaig Quarter Cask is a good choice if you haven't already had a bottle. ü•É
Love your analogy, and such a fitting one ü•É
Definitely get bacon on this, love the meaty qualities on the islay malts üòã
Thank you, really appreciate it. Don't be too envious as I'm a huge Bourbon fan, all the money I save on the Scotch ends up paying for those! üòÇ"
Name one mistake you've made...,"After a while, I get tired of reading 86/100 reviews.  What I need to know is what is an absolute drain pour that you wasted good money on.

I'll start - Aberlour 16 Double Cask Matured.  Should have not made an impulse buy, but I wanted to buy something because I probably won't be going out again for awhile.  When they didn't have what I wanted  (Glenfarclas 105), I should have walked out empty handed. Should have read the label and put it back on the shelf because it's 40% ABV.

It smells thin. It tastes thin and watery.  It only has one note - just a bit of sherry.  I should have just bought the 12 year old and saved 30 bucks.  Just a terribly blah whisky.","Well, drain pour, I don't know, but.

My mistakes were Macallans,

Macallan 12 triple cask

Macallan concept no 2 NAS  (I managed to save this one by adding a bit of Glendronach 18).

They are not directly bad but I did not like them and they were surely a waste of money.

I came really close to a drain pour with a sulfuric Glenfarlas Family casks, but I managed to clean it up using copper, it cleared out only the sulfuric note and became a wonderful dram after that.But almost ‚Ç¨260 into the drain.

&#x200B;

These days I am listening to various reviews (Ralfy) and I do check whiskybase and I have not had a wrong purchase since.
Buying a second bottle of Glenfarclas 105. The first I bought a few years ago and it was reasonable value. This new stuff must be 3 years old. It's practically new make and not so fresh and so clean  like you'd get from a young distillery either. Wish I'd grabbed the Talisker or Arran now.
Bruichladdich Classic Laddie. 

Just bought a bottle yesterday, I absolutely loathe this whisky despite going in with so much positivity about trying it. Musty, mushy and sour tasting, none of which are flattering adjectives in my world.
Sexton. Absolute trash.
Akashi white oak. I hated it. I tried everything I could with it. But it went down the drain
Thomson Two Tone Blend NZ Whisky. A local distillery. 

Scotlands got nothing to be afraid of here. Longest lasting bottle I‚Äôve had.
In decreasing order of awfulness (first = worst):

Brenne NAS single malt whisky

Auchentoshan American Oak

Henry McKenna NAS 80 proof bourbon

Glenfiddich Fire & Cane

Balvenie Peat Week, batch 1

lessons learned:

- Don't buy a bottle out of curiosity just because 1 blogger raved about it.

- Leave Auchentoshan to the Luftwaffe.

- *It's only 20 bucks (or less) - who knows, maybe it will turn out to be good?* is **not** a sound buying strategy

- William Grant & Sons don't know how to integrate peat with the flavors in their malts very well. Avoid in future regardless of reviews.
Hudson Baby Bourbon, horrible stuff.
The Spirit of ‚Äò45 from Springbank. Awful stuff!

It was A blend of 45 whiskies, at 45%, to mark the 45% Yes vote in 2014.

It tasted as bad as that defeat
Glenmorangie Lasanta. Even posted asking how to improve it and was wisely told to add plenty of cola, and it took a whole can per shot at that.
I bought two bottles of the George Dickel Rye because I love the #12, and I thought they would be as enjoyable. I couldn't manage to like any of it. It tasted like the taste of the rye was fighting with the taste imparted by the charcoal filtering.    
  
And I bought a bottle of Deanston Virgin Oak, because it was a scotch on the affordable side. It was horrible immature-tasting swill which tasted mostly of alcohol burn. After seeing what Deanston puts their name on, I'm not buying any more of their garbage again.   
  
Those are the two biggest mistakes, but I'll also mention that I tried Collingwood and it was boring, by-the-numbers middle of the road whisky with nothing standing out. It would be a good buy at $22, not the $35 or so it was listed for. And I tried Mellow Corn (almost impossible to find here, so paid $100 to try it when it seems to be more like $20 in the states), but there was almost nothing mellow about it. It was way too young and just tasted of alcohol burn.  
  
Although I regret those purchases, I think they're worth it for the education. It's good to try different things to know what's out there, as well as what you might like.
Possibly the most expensive bottle I've bought - a Kavalan Soloist Sherry - is undrinkable for years now. Sulphar and stink, evens a drop into some Jameson ruins the Jameson. Has the cask number on it, wish I could find someone else with the same batch to confirm how terrible it is.
Dalmore 12, bought it in the beginning of my whisky journey thinking it would be amazing given the pricepoint and packaging. Turned out to be a huge let down, it turned me of off sherried whisky for the longest time. I am only just now dipping my toes back into sherry territory with glenfarclas.
I tried makers mark. All I tasted from that shit was a strong wood flavor. Like sucking on a freshly snapped twig. No whiskey flavor, nothing else. Just bland wood.
I have two, but the former is way worse.  Auchentoshan American Oak and Basil Hayden's.
I didn't buy enough for quarantine.....
[Rebellion Bourbon](https://www.bourbonbanter.com/drink/drink-reviews/bourbon-reviews/rebellion-bourbon-review/#.Xn3KuR5lC2c): It is *the* worst whisky I have ever had the misfortune to drink and I've had Military Special. It tastes like a mixture between a contaminated charcoal bricket and kerosene.

Jura Single Malt: I bought a bottle on recommendation from a friend and thought it looked cool. I think it's shite.
Talisker Dark Storm.

I've really tried to like it, but it tastes like throw up. Every time.
Grabbing a bottle of whiskey named after an important historical figure in my state on impulse and  then realizing it was poor quality MGP juice.
Hellbender Georgia Bourbon.

Tastes like feet. It's a local distillery so I'd thought I would give it a try. 

They make a passable rum, but way overpriced for what it is.
Isle of skye. Thank God I only bought a half bottle
Love this topic. Nothing to bad here I'd say the only bottle I didn't want after a while was Aberfeldy  12. It wasn't bad just never felt into it
Bourbon, I've only taken one that didn't taste sour to me, and I'm including wheated bourbons.
Paid $60 for a distillery exclusive Single Malt from Driftless Glen in Wisconsin. I loved the flight I tried and figured in was worth the ""EXCLUSIVE!"" label. Absolutely rancid stuff. I don't know if it was just way too young or something was wrong with the barrel, but it should have never been bottled and sold in the state it was in.
Cody Road, Weller, both just gross.

But, OP, if you want to give Aberlour another try, the A'bunadh I got as a gift some time back was delicious. A rich, sweet, slightly thicker mouthfeel scotch that I dearly miss. I just wish it wasn't so pricey nowadays.
Currently tasting Outlaw Legend Holiday release. So much artificial color/ flavoring.
Glen Moray Peated. I find it plain (camp fire smoke and that is it), thin and watery.
Dalmore Cigar Malt - sounds fancy but what they mean is that the tang of paint stripper could cut through anything, even a cigar. 

Really keen to try their standard stuff but this specialty is on the shelf for guests only
Not a dram but bottles i wasted money on are mostly speysides and highlands. Its mostly because i fell in love with ISlays and now wishing i spent money more on those whiskies.
I've bought a few bottles of juice that I wish I hadn't. Some of them are very highly rated on this site, so I'm not going to name names, on account of I don't want to offend anybody. 

However, I would like to add this note. The Romans, over 2000 years ago, coined this phrase: In the matter of taste, there is no dispute. (I used to quote this in Latin, but nowadays nobody understands Latin, lol). Having said that, there are a lot of things out there, scotch among them, that appeal to some people, and are disgusting to others. 

Rather than just pour the bottles of bad scotch down the drain, I either mix it up in a scotch version of a bloody mary, with plenty of lime, black pepper, and Worcestershire sauce, or I find someone who like it, and just gift it to them. Problem solved.
Redbreast. Its just swill. So many people raved and rated it that I especially hunted down a bottle locally, JHC its rough. Its not just hating on Irish expressions either, a good Bushmills is super drinkable, stumbled on a bottle of Knappogue castle some years ago, that was v nice, it was a good year that year, and the last aged Middleton I bought was so so smooth, but just dont put Redbreast in my glass, its going down the drain.
Nice to know I‚Äôm not the only one who self blends. 

Had to do that with a bottle Tobermory 10. Added the last of a scotch club sample of Octomore. Made the Tobermory drinkable at least.
Interesting.  I haven't had Glenfarclas but wanted to try it because they're supposed to be one of the old school distilleries.  Have you had anything from them other than 105?
Give it some time in the bottle. I was pretty disappointed from the first pour but it really improved for me after a while.
And an unusual bottle which is very difficult bottle to pour but may appeal to the casual drinker. Seems more designed by marketers than whiskey lovers.
This is good to know. I was interested in giving Thomsen a whirl, have you had any of the others?
I really like Brenne, but I don't think of it as whisky - more like a denser Cr√®me de Banane (which I used to love, before my diabetes diagnosis...).

I only ever drank half a 30ml Drinks by the Dram of Auchentoshan American Oak - the rest went down the sink.  (I don't understand the Luftwaffe reference, but I think I would agree with it if I did!)

I've had Henry McKenna twice at bars (different bottles/batches): one tasted like drain cleaner and the other was drinkable, but below average.

I had Fire & Cane at a bar and that was more than enough.  Similarly Balvenie Peat Week.  However, I did quite like the Glenfiddich Caoran Reserve and I have a bottle of Balvenie Peated Triple Cask, so I wouldn't write off William Grant & Sons just yet.

I think I've been quite lucky that my worst five whiskies I've tried either as samples or in a bar, so I haven't got stuck with a whole bottle of Cleveland Underground Black Cherry Wood Bourbon (definite drain pour - the worst whiskey I have ever encountered, bar none!), Hudson Manhattan Rye (which I nearly spat out!), the above-mentioned Auchentoshan, Duggan's Dew or Macallan Classic Cut.
Auchentoshan Three Wood, Blood Oak, and their distillery exclusives are actually pretty good. The American Oak is the one that people immediately dislike.
Yep, I bought one of these duty free on my honeymoon. By the end I was drinking just to get through it

Edit: the bottle, that is. Not the honeymoon! Ha
I've got 5 Deanston bottles, all of them way better than the Virgin Oak (in fact: on principle, I try to avoid anything that mentions Virgin Oak, as it usually spells disaster...).  The Deanston 12 year old is such a good 'daily drinker' that it prompted me to visit the distillery (which is brilliant, by the way) and I am particularly fond of the Toasted Oak I picked up from the gift shop, the Decennary and the 10 year old PX Finish (of which I just finished a double).
I had a bad experience with Maker's Mark. The sharp alcohol taste was just waaay too strong.
Agree on both counts, but Basil Hayden's is more disappointing, since it would be so much better bottled at 45%.
Really? I tried an Auchentoshan, and it's hard to remember, but I think it was the triple wood one. Is the American Oak really much worse? Because the Auchentoshan I tried was spectacular.
It took me a few months to push through the bottle of american oak i mistakenly purchased...
Was it old hickory? I bet it was old hickory. Friggin terrible.
Other good topic - is there good MGP?
Weller gross?
I've had it many year ago and didn't really like it, but I thought I would give Aberlour another try....
That was me, but recently I've been burned out on peated Islays, so have been trying other things - hence the Aberlour.

The Aberlour has been the only failure (though I've been saddened by how much Highland Park has changed), but I've found wonderful new things I like - Deanston 12, Sprinkbank 15, the Classic Laddie -  so a miss every now and again is to be expected.
> Some of them are very highly rated on this site, so I'm not going to name names, on account of I don't want to offend anybody.

That's ok, you've already tried to offend most of us.
Man I love Redbreast, the cask strength is an exceptional pour.
I don't usually like Irish whiskey, but have a bottle of Green Spot I quite like.
I saved a bottle of Four Roses I didn't like by adding scotch to it (it turned into an infinity bottle).  There was a case where the Four Roses wasn't bad, I just didn't like it.

I'm not sure I want to add this Aberlour to my scotch infinity bottle.  Maybe I'll spike it with something.
Yeah, I've had a family cask at a tasting that might be the best whisky I've ever had. I can't remember what year though. Also I've had the 12yo and that's good value for money. Simple sherried malt, but it's dirt cheap and bottled at 43%, so it meets my minimum threshold. 

Iirc, Glenfarclas is one of the bigger distilleries and they make a huge range of products - huge range in quality too it seems.
No, but I'd try it in a bar first. Rather than dropping coin on a whole bottle.

I love supporting local food producers, sadly in my single bottle experience, nah. Not my cuppa tea thanks.

I'm no connoisseur, but it was an NAS blend, probably quite young. I really hope they start to improve once they get some age. Plenty of great water and grain produced in NZ.
> I don't understand the Luftwaffe reference

Auchentoshan is known for using a circa 1941 German bomb crater as the pond from which their cooling water is drawn.

Really surprised that Mac Classic Cut makes your *worst of* list there.
Agree. Was a fan of the Three Wood so tried an American Oak at my local bar thinking I'd enjoy it similarly. 

Absolutely hated it.
I'm glad you've had better experiences with them, but I can only go off what I've tried of theirs, and at the end of the day, they decided to put their name on the virgin oak and release it. If I ever bother to go to a whisky tasting and try some deanston that impresses me, I might reconsider. But, as the saying goes, first impressions are everything.  
  
There's a newer Brewery about 3 blocks from me, but I'm not going back there because the beer of theirs that I tried was horrible. Sure, you could say it's because they were just starting out, but I tried it and didn't think it was any good.   
  
I wish deanston hadn't released this, because it gives a bad impression of their products.
I didn‚Äôt even taste the alcohol when I had it. Like I said, the only flavor was literally wet wood
OGD114 is glorious.  I have no clue why it's cheaper than BH, but not complaining.
If it‚Äôs the Three Wood I completely agree. It‚Äôs funny though - I really like the Three Wood (it is a semi-regular buy) but have not enjoyed any of the other common Auchentoshan bottles. I have, however, got a bottle of the Auchentoshan 21 year old (which I bought simply because of my enjoyment of the Three Wood) so I am hoping that it veers more towards the Three Wood flavour profile.
Nope.

There are some awesome MGP store pick single barrels. Belle Mead and Joseph Magnus come to mind.
Smooth Ambler Old Scout is all MGP juice, and there are some beauties in that line
Whistle pig
I had a fantastic Boone County Eighteen 33 that was 12 year old MGP bourbon and my favourite WhistlePig Rye (aged 13 years and 10 months) came from them.  In fact, I don't think I have ever had a bad MGP whiskey...
Specifically, the Old Weller Antique cheap stuff. It's just harsh. I bought some based on a store's recommendation that it's a poor man's van Winkle. Absolutely not. I've had me some Pappy, and it's not even close.
That's fair. Everyone's taste is different. That's why we have sweet stuff, strong peppery stuff, heavily peated stuff, etc. Variety is great!
I've been an Islay drinker for almost 50 years. I finally decided to try some other things, so went out and got a bottle of Aberlour Sherry cask (batch 67, as nothing lower was available), as it was well reviewed on this site, and seemed to have an interesting flavor profile (from the reviews). Although it certainly lacks any smoke, which was the first thing my wife noted when she nosed a glass, it was highly flavored, and the Christmas cake seemed an appropriate description. It reminded me of Bowmore 15 year old, Darkest, and is best described, I believe, as a desert scotch. I'm still reading over reviews of other expressions, to see where I'll go on my next foray off of Islay.
I figured out that it is the unmalted barley used in the Irish Whiskey mash bill that creates that Irish Whiskey flavor I generally don‚Äôt like.  I wonder if Green Spot uses less of that.
Glenfarclas isn‚Äôt actually that big a distillery at all, still family owned actually. But you are right, huge range of age statements and seems to fluctuate in quality
Well, that's fair enough, I suppose.  I just always regard ""Virgin Oak"" as a warning!  And that wasn't the first Deanston I tried...
Old Weller Antique is the best of the line up!  And it's more than close, it's the exact same mash bill, exact same yeast strain, exact same rickhouses.  Just a few years younger.  OWA tends to be 6 or 7 years old while the entry level Van Winkle, Old Rip, is 10 years old.  Other than that they're the same proof and everything else.  Perhaps it's the higher proof (107) that makes you think it's harsh.  I find it to be super mellow, the wheated mash gives it a soft sweetness and honestly, if anything, is too soft and sweet.  A bit simple.  Still a tasty pour.

If you don't like it though you don't like it.  Just surprising to hear.  That whiskey is typically well regarded by everyone.
Maybe I'm not remembering correctly... *runs down to the liquor cabinet*
Guess I'll never know... I forgot I tossed it into a batch of eggnog, so I don't have a bottle to check anymore. Oh, well."
Are these tasting notes just going too far?,,"Nonsense. I hate it.
I think it‚Äôs definitely pretentious bs.
Maybe my palate isn‚Äôt as refined but sometimes it‚Äôs as if reviewers try to get as many different things in as possible?
TBH I don't care. If somebody's tasting notes don't resonate with me, after a while I stop reading them.

But it would be amusing if, somewhat like say random drug testing in the workplace, whisky reviewers were periodically and with no advanced warning required to re-enact physically in the most literal fashion possible the things they describe in their notes.

""Stuffing all the fruity marshmallows and cheeseboard in your mouth in one go""

OK, whisky expert - open up, we're gonna do this. No, wider. WIDER.

Oh and you over there, Rob - yes, you. Here's your peat shovel, better get out there and start digging...
I'm not sure what snickers bar cheesecake served up alongside baked brie would taste like, so that note would be fairly useless to me.
Some people like details I guess? I am not one who does though. I either like a whisky or I don't and I keep it that simple.
It's like with wine tasting, feel like telling the guy just pour me a drink and go away

Gift from the wife‚Äôs friend for dogsitting; what is the general opinion and tasting notes on this?,,"Dogsitting & A Balvenie 12? life couldn't get much better!
That's a fantastic bottle of scotch, and one of my favourites. The only one I like more is also from Balvenie, their 14Y Caribbean Cask.

Your wife's friend seems awesome- she happen to be single?  :D
You've lucked out there. An all time favourite of mine
This is a solid entry to Balvenie and a really nice scotch IMO. Enjoy! If you really like it consider trying the Balvenie Caribbean Cask 14 yr
It is good... tasting notes = delicious
You got lucky as hell, friend. Balvenie is in my top 5 distilleries in Scotland for quality of distillate and product. Great assembly line products even, not to mention single casks..
Good single malt. The dogs must be pleased if you got this gift :)
Delicious
Got a bottle of balvenie triple cask and that‚Äôs fantastic so that should shape up well too
My house whisky - I always have a bottle of Balvenie. Nectar of the gods!
One of the first I thoroughly enjoyed when I got into scotch.

Bought one recently to celebrate the birth of my first born, was a bit disappointed. Maybe I held it in too high a regard, or maybe my taste evolved.

The 14Y Carribean is superior imo. Still a good scotch though
This is a well-crafted one for sure. 
I‚Äôve had a Lot better, but I‚Äôve also had a Lot worse. Like Jack Daniels. Yuck!
Really good bottle - the first bottle of Scotch I bought and drank start to finish.

All I remember of tasting notes is that after I drank about half the bottle, I sort of forgot about it and let it sit for a month or two - it took on a rich, velvety, butterscotch-y flavor
It's delicious.  If only the finish was better. The old 10 year old was even better, god knows why they stopped making it.
Why do you care what other people think about it? Drink it and tell us. Develop your own opinion then collect your internet points.
Roark is a very happy cocker spaniel that is very sweet and well mannered. Dogsitting is the best of both worlds.
If you are of the female persuasion then yes, if not then probably not.... lol
I will put it on the list to try next shopping day out.
Wow - high praise! Out of curiosity, what are the other odd four or so that hold its‚Äô company?
Thanks for that - I am looking forward to trying this once I am not under the weather!
What about the finish do you not like?
r/relevantusername
Balvenie is really a high quality outfit, and one of the few with the courage to experiment. Anthony Bourdain did a fun episode with them on 'Raw Craft'. RIP my brother..

Bruichladdich ranks highest on that list, hands down, for a plethora of reasons: integrity of distillate process, courage for experimentation, and some of the best whisky in the world still made; as well as purity/proof of their assembly line products. The smaller distilleries of integrity round out that list: Edradour, Kilchoman and Kilkerran. There are many more, and the complexity of independent releases really adds to this list..
I just find the finish quite short. It's a gorgeous malt though but I much preferred the 10 year old founders reserve and the 12 year old signature. Balvenie is one of my favourite distilleries.
Looks like I have homework to accomplish.... thanks for this!"
Kilkerran Heavily Peated Batch 1 vs Batch 2,"I had a dribble left in my Kilkerran Heavily Peated Batch 1 bottle and my missus got me Batch 2 for Christmas so I really wanted to compare the 2 whiskies and see if there was anything comparable or dissimilar with the whiskies.

**Batch 1:**

**Nose:** Buttery digestive biscuits like making a cheesecake base when you mash all the biscuit and cover it with melted butter. There is sweet green apples and a little tangy peat smoke.

**Palate:** Malty, toasted cereals that remind me more of granola. The peat is more prominent in the palate than it was in the nose. Some citrus flavours and more apples. Towards the end I get a real sweetness which seems to be cookie dough, lovely.

**Finish:** Medium to long. The earthy peat makes a return alongside lemon and a real creaminess. There is possibly some hazelnut too. This whisky covers the mouth in an oily, creamy and viscous type coating.

&#x200B;

**Batch 2:**

**Nose:** Compared to Batch 1 this has more of a dunnage warehouse smell to it. I feel as if the higher ABV makes it appear the younger of the two although I believe both are around the 3-3.5 year mark. The only varying note I can highlight is a cheap eraser on the end of a pencil. It smells like that being rubbed over paper.

**Palate:** That burnt scent from earlier carries over to the palate but now it is more like burnt toast which is comparable to the toasted cereals from Batch 1. However, this is definitely burnt toast and it tastes like it has been covered in butter to hide the fact that the toast is burnt.

**Finish:** Another notable difference on this whisky is the butterscotch sweetness that comes along with the finish. A real sweet buttery candy, not creamy like Batch 1 but still the same mouth feel.

**Overall:** Both these whiskies cost around ¬£30-¬£40 when they came out and both have similar makeup with the slight difference of ABV (Batch 1 50.3% and Batch 2 60.9%) so picking out differences was a real chore, well as much of a chore as whisky drinking can be...For me, Batch 1 take the **whisky win** and I am not sure if it is because I have finished the full bottle and spent more time with it or if it is because of the slightly lower ABV, which is weird as I usually love higher ABV whiskies. I hope they have aged Batch 1 so that I can try some older HP in the future!

A proper Christmas Glenlivet 18 review,"What‚Äôs up homies! Obligatory ‚Äúmy first review, so be kind.‚Äù

But, for real, critique away.

I‚Äôve been a lingering here for a while, and an avid taster/collector for years. Here we go;

[GLENLIVET 18](https://imgur.com/zCUHujV)

Glass: Trusty glencairn. Pure crystal excellence. Has never let me down, unlike Wal-Mart this week.

.

Location: At my kitchen bar, in my underwear. Literally can fee every fucking grain of wood of this barstool in my thighs. It‚Äôs invigorating.

.

Music playing: Satan has frowned on me and Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúFrozen‚Äù is blasting in the background. Bah humbug. My ears are bleeding.

.

The legs on this bad boy are impressive. They‚Äôre long, streaky, and oily (like your mother, Trebek!). Gets me hyped for the finish.

.

Nose: Loud and strong. Big Apple and vanilla notes. Spicy, caramel used sugars.

.

Mouthfeel: Super heavy and full. This shit is like an appetizer. Tannins and oak remind you they‚Äôre there, but then here comes the Christmas party. Lots of walnut, honey, and apples. But more like apple pie. Citrus peel at the end.

.

Finish: Loooong and mildly spicy. Very festive.

.

Absolutely fantastic. This shit is like drinking a Hobby Lobby. Would absolutely buy again, especially if we stay under $100.

Score: 88/100. Would totes buy again.","That sounds pretty good. Ive only had the 12 year from Glenlivet's line but it always has me craving more body that I typically get from 43%+ABV Whiskies. Ive eyeballed the 18 but havent jumped yet.
What's that notebook ya got there OP?
I‚Äôve seen it at varying price points, anywhere from $80-109. I wouldn‚Äôt spend more than $100, but totally worth it.
[‚ÄúWhisky: A Connoisseur‚Äôs Journal‚Äù by La Maison du Whisky](https://www.amazon.com/Whisky-Connoisseurs-Journal-Maison-du/dp/2080203398). I love it. Pretty to look at, and efficiently laid out.
I believe you would have a field day when visiting Belgium then.
A bottle of Glenlivet 18 goes here for 55 euros which is about 61 dollars.
And we're one of the priciest countries here for all things with alcohol in them.

Sadly I for one don't find the Glenlivet 18 worth the price. I just expected more from a whisky in that age range. But on the plus side it isn't as expensive as most others of the same age."
"Some whiskeys (Monkey Shoulder, Elijah Craig Small Batch) taste vaguely like burning rubber to me. What is that?",I've read lots of tasting notes and nobody seems to mention anything remotely similar...,"The burnt rubber flavor is caused by sulphur compounds. These occur naturally as part of the distillation process, and are absorbed by the cask during aging, so often these flavors can indicate a younger spirit. 

They can come across in Scotch for a couple additional specific reasons. The peating process imparts sulfur into the malt, and sherry casks used to be sanitized with sulfur candles. I have a bottle of Glenrothes that‚Äôs like chewing on a burning tire.
Thanks! That's helpful. Any way to predict whether or not a whisk(e)y will have this quality? I'm not a big fan.
The most reliable answer would be to stay away from young, peated, and sherried whisk(e)y.

An older age statement is a good place to look. I'd expect 10+ years should do it; bourbon should be quicker than scotch since the active new oak will absorb sulfur faster than the refill casks used for scotch. Getting these flavors in ECSB is a bit surprising since it should be old enough, and I don't personally recall any sulfur notes in any EC. Maybe its batch variation, or just differing sensitivity and palates. I'm a big peat-head though, and probably don't have the most refined palate, so I might just not pick up on it unless it's really prevalent.

For sherried whisky, it actually sounds like this sulfur sanitization started in the 90s, so older casks should theoretically not have this issue. Make sure any sherried whisky you buy is 30+ years, lol. This might only be an issue with original sherry casks too, which are becoming much more rare. I can't recall experiencing strong sulfur from sherry seasoned casks.
I love Reddit. The things I learn on this subreddit alone are worth putting up with the crazy comments you sometimes get."
Newbie looking for a bottle...,"So, I‚Äôm tryna get away from my usual drink and I‚Äôve developed a wee taste for a hawf now n then. 
Ones I‚Äôve enjoyed in the past have been bunnahabhain 15 (I think it was 15) Highland park 12 and 15, dalwhinnie 15 (wasn‚Äôt bad) and Auchentoshan, Glenlivet 12. Most recently I had the Dalmore 12 which I really enjoyed! 
I distinctly dislike laphroig/Talisker. 

So I‚Äôve got about ¬£40 to spend on a bottle for myself. I‚Äôd stretch up for the dalmore 12 after last Saturday but I thought I‚Äôd challenge my palette a little and roll the dice. 
Any recommendations?
Chairs folks!

EDIT: appreciate all the comments on here and I‚Äôve taken the advice of some. I plumped for the Glengoyne 12 year old single malt.
It arrives tomorrow. I‚Äôm hopeful of the ‚Äúlingering coffee notes‚Äù it promises. 

Ah‚Äô the best!","No peat for you then.

for around the ¬£40 mark go for:
Glenfarclas 12, 
Glengoyne 12, 
Benromach 12, 
Glen Scotia Double Cask, 
Aberlour 12 or
Balvenie 12.
just to name a few
I like abelour it's really tasty
I‚Äôm usually a scotch drinker myself however you may find it resourceful to try a bourbon such as bulleit or even buffalo trace. Drink what you like the way you like it.
Bunnahabhain 12 is a slightly sherried scotch, like the Dalmore, but it has some extra alcohol in it (46.3 % abv).  While this will give you a bigger ""kick"" than the Dalmore. It is unpeated and can be had for ¬£45. I love it.
Glenmorangie Lasanta, I think it strikes the right balance of being different than what you've tried (but not too much) and still a cheaper whisky.
Had an Oban 14 this weekend. I enjoyed its simple yet surprisingly distinct blend of tastes. I recomend it as a fine and honest whisky
Dalmore is so good, glad you have tried and enjoyed. If you haven't tried Macallan, this is a serious suggestion. If not the next bottle, then PLEASE the bottle after that. It is glorious and you'll save yourself ¬£4 if you get it from Tesco! There are so many expressions and if you like a speyside/Highland whisky then you are bound to enjoy. Glenmorangie was another great suggestion, there are many great expressions to try if you enjoy the first one you try (wine casks, port casks etc). Slightly more niche, but Fettercairn is a smaller distillery but produces beautiful whisky, there are only 2 affordable expressions at the moment but they are really great. Let us know what you go for!
If you really want to change it up but not completely give trace to the American bourbon, try a good ole bottle of Jameson.
Glenmorangie 12 is great or GlenGrant 12.
Scapa Skiren!
Glenfarclas 15
Macallan 12
Two bottles of Jameson
I second Glengoyne 12. That's a real clean flavor.
Thanks muchly! I had a look at some reviews and there‚Äôs a bottle of Glenglassaugh Revival which appears to have similar notes/tones to the dalmore. Any experience with it? I‚Äôd never heard of it. It appeared in the ‚Äúother customers also purchased‚Äù section...
Noted, thanks boss!
It is peated. But only 2 ppm. Doesn't show up much but it is there. Ardbeg is 55 ppm for reference.....and the Octomore 10.1 I just bought and will be so good is 107 ppm.
This came up a few times in the ‚Äúcustomers who bought this also bought‚Äù section of a few websites. Have you tried it?
Wrong subreddit for that...
You are most welcome and depending where you are in the world jamesons is a good one for a bit of a cheaper price
Coincidentally, I just tried Aberlour for the first time at the weekend, and was blown away. It's the next bottle I'm going to pick up. I'm not a fan of peat at all, and can only handle smoke to a small degree, so we probably have quite similar tastes.
I forgot to add, I haven't tried it yet, but I do have a bottle sitting in my basement. I've had other glenmorangies and I've loved them, so I'm sure I'll love it given how highly it's rated.
He may not have tried it, but I have (several times) and I liked it enough to buy a bottle...
This is r/whiskey right? And Jameson is Irish whiskey right?
Ashamedly, I‚Äôm in Scotland. There‚Äôs a lot of distilleries nearby...I even work in the industry to a degree. Just haven‚Äôt ventured into buying a bottle before!
Not today Satan. Not today.
Haha gods country. Or possibly go to a local whisky shop. If you tell them what you like they should be able to give you some good options
I‚Äôll be honest, that‚Äôs a shit hot idea that is so simple I wonder why I hadn‚Äôt thought of it! D‚Äôoh!
Well I wouldn't worry about it mate I do it all the time. Good luck"
Willet potstill let me down,So I read the reviews.  Some loved it most hated it.  I had to see for myself.   Taste to me is watery and heavy mint.  So much so I can‚Äôt finish a dram.   Very disappointed.  Next time I may listen to the hive mind.,"At least you didn't spend over Aud$100 (nearly USD$70!) on it, thinking it was something else like I did.
I got a ton of green apple (like candy artifical green apple flavor) when I tried Willett.
I love Willet, to each his own but there is a reason why they can not keep it in stock at my local liquor store's.
I found it to be pretty mediocre. Not horrible, but there‚Äôs better for the price point."
A budget dram - Castle and Crag,"So I'm looking for a really cheap Scotch whisky that is actually drinkable.

Looking in the bracket of ¬£10 to ¬£20 a bottle, but the cheaper the better (min 70cl)

I decided to post a tiny review on what I find which might help others pick up something drinkable when funds are low.

Please bear in mind that this is my opinion and what I find to be rubbing alcohol, you might actually like.

I will write what I taste so this will be light on the old ""hints of seared vanilla floating on clean spring water with a chocolate nostril"" BS.

&#x200B;

So without further a do the first tipple - Castle and Crag - Single grain scotch whisky.

&#x200B;

Bought From - Aldi

Price - around ¬£11.00

Initial taste - You know when you buy cheap whisky from Spain that tastes like someone has put a flavour in cheap vodka - its nearly there but not quite there. Very chemical.

A few down the line - Hmm seems to swing between pretend whisky (see above comment) and sometimes pretend Rum.

Can I finish the bottle - Probably but it will take me a while. I have had worse and it is drinkable after the initial shock but I would not say pleasant.

Very tempted to throw some Ginger ale in it.

Would I buy it again - I very much doubt it.

&#x200B;

So that's all I need to say - If you find this useful maybe you budget Scotch drinkers could add your own reviews.

Just start them with 'A budget dram' and lets see where it goes.","I like this because this is what I tend to drink of a normal weekend - a budget dram. Have not tried the Aldi choices but have tried the Lidl - Ben bracken range I think it‚Äôs called. I‚Äôll try remember to do a review next time I buy but from memory they were quite nice for the price
Check out Glenfairn from tesco, ¬£20 a bottle, very nice stuff
Whyte & Mackay is my absolute go-to when I'm a bit skint. Amazing value for money.
I picked up a bottle of Speyburn 12 last week at the ABC store here in NC, because it was running $28, not sure the current exchange rate. If you like a Speyside, it's a passable bottle. Not a lot of depth there, but very Well-mannered, with all the vanilla and fruit notes you'd expect. Oaky on the finish, with no peat to be found. Skip the water, because there isn't enough body to bring out. Still, for a two-finger pour after dinner, it's one I wouldn't turn down.
Vat 69, Old Sailor, The Famous Grouse, Teachers.

Or, even better, just drink Irish, Paddy, Powers, Jameson, Bushmills, Tullamore. Can't go wrong. Much, much better than any cheap Scotch."
This is great for the price point! Anything better for around $20? Ill comment the notes and review it soon.,,"Jim Beam Distillers Cut is a fantastic bottle for around that price range. Just good classic burboun.
I really like the monkey shoulder I saw recommended here. I think I picked it up for $30. 

Four roses is good to.
Better? Well that's debatable. My favorite bottles around $20 are:

* Buffalo Trace

* Evan Williams Single Barrel

* Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond

* Mellow Corn

* Monkey Shoulder

* Johnnie Walker Black

* Glenmorangie 10

* Glenfiddich 12

* Glenlivet 12
This is closer to $35 in my neck of the woods. With that in mind, my other favorites in that bracket are JWB, Monkey Shoulder, Talisker Storm, and Suntory Toki. Different things for different jobs.
I love  Heaven Hill. Elijah, Rittenhouse and Bernheim is a really great lineup for me to do just about any whisky cocktail I want, and they're often the cheapest thing in the store. Drunk straight, they're kinda flat, but boy do they make good cocktails. I'm also particular to Pikesville.
I've recently fallen in love with Old Grand Dad BiB.
Knob Creek small batch tastes great, is slightly higher proof, and can be found for around $20 if you look.
E. Craig is way better then most bourbon 25$ and below. It‚Äôs one of my favorite bourbons and I tried a lot of them.
Many good ones already mentioned, but Old Forester Rye is about $23 where I live and is fantastic. Will hang with ANY whisky you can get for $30 or less as well as many more pricey ones.
/u/RustyPipes
Sick em boy
I‚Äôve had Monkey Shoulder in a cigar lounge before, it was great. I‚Äôll definitely get a bottle when I see one.
Where are you finding any of those for around 20?!Those are all around 30 where I‚Äôm at...
Maybe this is a 375ml bottle?
Went to the liquor store the other day to pick up Buffalo Trace ( if in stock) or WT 101....somehow walked out with E. Craig instead.  Not disappointed at all!
sigh."
Best app for whisky tasting notes?,"Ladies & Gents - I posted this in the Scotch area as well but thought I'd post it here for additional input.  I'm new to Reddit but as I dive deeper into the world of scotch tasting and collecting I realized it would be nice to have an app to store notes on various bottles. Does anyone use something along these lines and if so, what's the best app you've found? I'm also a SMWS member so a database having Society whisky options would be helpful as well, or at least the ability for me to create my own bottles in the app. Thanks and looking forward to learning from you all!","The Distiller app sounds like it would match what you are looking for. You can leave notes on bottles and can create want lists/ collection lists.  If a certain bottle you have is not listed you can add it in yourself.
I use Whizzky more than Distiller but only because I like how Whizzky handles my collection better.
I've just been leaving a short tasting note and a score and price in my regular notes app. Just curious, what else can you do in these apps?
Flaviar. Imo their flavor spirals are accurate and what I use to determine if I'll enjoy a whiskey enough to buy a bottle or if I should try it somewhere first.
I just use Apple notes, and it works well for me.
So I started using Distiller but just switched to the Apple Notes app.  Thanks for the feedback, all.
I am the developer of the Drammer whisky app [https://drammer.com](https://drammer.com) for iOS and Android It features collection management, barcode scanner, searching by taste, whisky news and a database with over 20.000 whiskies. You can try the app without creating an account. An account is only needed when you want to store your collection, reviews etc.   


We have some SMWS bottlings in our database, but I am sure we are not having them all. However in the app you are able to add new bottlings. If you have any questions feel free to ask :)
Perfect - I'll give it a download and will check it out.
By far the best one out there, agreed.
I downloaded Distiller and added my collection and wish list, which is nice, although they don‚Äôt keep current on SMWS offerings so I had to manually enter those. Seems like the reviews and rating options are fairly robust however. Section for score and notes and you can browse other‚Äôs feedback.
Me too.  565 different Scotches and counting.  ;)"
Calling all experienced Whiskey tasters!,"I've recently gotten into whiskey and learning that there is so much more to whiskey than the pop culture in country music and the club culture of shots. I have been readying Tasting Whiskey by Lew Bryson and he mentions that before he started getting into whiskey, his experience was just the heat from the alcohol, spiciness, and taking it down in shots or hidden in mixed drinks. He said that his publisher recommended he needs to get past the alcohol wall, and to do so he needed to drink whiskey every day and he'd get past it. The wall was described as similar to how peppers are only spicy, until you get accustomed to the spice, then you start to taste the flavors of the pepper. 

For Bryson, the wall was passed after 3 weeks of drinking a little whiskey everyday. I'm relatively new, and have only consumed whiskey at a low frequency by having occasional tastings with friends. Even though I can taste more notes that initially, I still don't get nearly as many as reviewers, and I hope to employ the strategy to get past the wall.

TL;DR, how long of consistent whiskey tasting did you then start to really taste more than just a few notes of whiskey?

Edit: by drinking everyday, I think the author meant small amounts. Not enough to actually intoxicate.

Edit 4/29/19: it has been a few weeks since my post and I did go through with tasting daily. I did only a little at night before bed, less than an ounce worth. Some times I did more if I was with friends for a tasting, but not to the point of drunkenness or even a buzz. I will say that the Wall was real and I have pasted a huge milestone in tasting. I can finally distinguish more and more notes from whiskey than before and some whiskeys that I had in the past surprise me now as I taste completely different things now. The glencairn glass also helps too.","I too agree with not drinking every day.

It isn't a sudden thing, so there's no point in trying to force it. You just gradually notice the ethanol a little less, the other flavors a little bit more, over a period of time. There isn't some dramatic moment of breakthrough. In my case the most rapid such change happened my first 2-3 years or so. Trying a wide variety of *different* flavors, styles and personalities of whisky, especially side-by-side so you can compare & contrast them, probably helps as much or more so as the sheer volume of alcohol consumed.

One of the things which strikes me reading comments from newcommers on these subs is what a godawful *hurry* so many people are in. Slow down. Assuming you aren't suffering from a terminal illness [my deepest sympathy & condolences if you are], you've got years of enjoyment ahead of you, don't try to rush thru it all at once.
This reads like some industry shill trying to get us addicted. 

Alcohol is a powerful drug. A DRUG.

Under no circumstances should you drink every day. You will become an alcoholic. Save it for the weekend and other special occasions.
I began drinking whisky occasionally almost a decade ago. It took a long time for me to appreciate whisky beyond ""I really like that one"", and an equally long time to progress beyond simple descriptors like smooth, sweet, peaty, smoky, sherried, rich or spicy. 

It's only really in the last year that I feel my palate has developed enough to draw out subtle nuances in flavour - and most of that has come from experience and trying lots of different drams. 

I think the most important thing is mindfulness. If, each time you taste a whisky, you make a conscious effort to nose it, savour the taste on your tongue and pay attention to the finish, you'll develop a good palate more quickly than if you're distractedly sipping on whisky at bars or sharing a bottle in a big group. But it's a slow process, and like others here, I don't recommend trying to jump-start it by drinking more whiskies than you naturally would. 
For me it isn‚Äôt like there was a point where all of a sudden my taste changed. I‚Äôve been drinking whiskey regularly for a few years and it probably took about a year before I noticed that the alcohol didn‚Äôt bother me much. But still high proof drams can be uncomfortable without adding some water and there‚Äôs definitely a difference in taste after the first couple of sips. I found that starting with more water or ice and slowly bringing that down made the experience more enjoyable and easier. As the other commenter said, don‚Äôt force yourself to drink alcohol everyday, that seems like a poor plan. Instead try a side by side comparison of a small amount of 2-3 types every few days. That‚Äôll help to make you more aware of flavor differences. And go slow, a little sip at first, let it swish around your mouth for 5-10 seconds, swallow, then exhale. Less burn and more flavor. You don‚Äôt need a huge gulp to appreciate it, in fact it‚Äôs the opposite.
I'm in no hurry, I've got time! I've just was curious. I'm trying to learn a lot about the drink, history, and culture so that I can build continued respect and never treat it as just an intoxicating drink that you slam down only for the alcohol. I think appreciating and tasting it fosters responsible drinking and helps prevent possible alcoholism, something that's in my family history. 
I've considered it being an industry marketing thing. The recommendation the author said was meant to be little amount everyday. Just a tasting and not an intoxicating amount. Ill keep watching out for that. 
wait what? so if i have a couple oz per day thats not ok?
Good for you. I like to think of drinks appreciation as being very much like food appreciation - the variety & diversity and culture & history & people are all part of the fun.

One thing I like to emphasize is that IMHO the beginner phase of appreciating whisky is just as valuable, enjoyable and fun as what veterans get out it. 

When you are new it sounds so alluring to be able to sniff & sip a fine dram and say ""*ahhh yes, I get notes of salt-caked ship's rigging, swallow's nests, Oregon blackberries picked in July down near the coast, and old leather-covered books shelved by a left-handed librarian who walks with a slight limp (residue of an old skiing accident)*"". How glorious it must be to be able to find things like that in a glass?

And yet...

what the veteran is missing out on is the wonderful newness and strangeness of it all, when the world was a larger place and the possibilities seemed endless (and certainly much larger than one's budget). And there are drams that you'll probably enjoy more when you are new, than later on when one tends to become a bit jaded.

So have fun, enjoy each phase for what it brings. Also, there is this:

I don't think there's much wrong with a double a day *per se*, but if you're in the habit of doing it, it's extremely easy to just pour a second glass, or to instinctively pour a drink through habit rather than for true appreciation.

Over 15 years, I've occasionally struggled with my relationship with alcohol and have to make a conscious effort not to slip into bad habits. For me, a daily drink is one of those bad habits. You may be different - but it can take years before a habit becomes a harmful one.
If you're talking about the G&M 1992 limited bottling of Clynelish 21 - and from your description, it can hardly be anything else - then it's *clearly* August-picked Oregon blackberries, you uncultured swine. 
Yeah. I always wondered if the tasting note of ""barbecue on the beach on a warm summers night next to a smokey fire"" was a standardized tasting note! 
true. i can see that. and its something i think about and keep in mind.
LOL
My take on detailed tasting notes is that describing aromas and flavors in words is extremely difficult. When I taste a whisky (which I've been doing for a decade now) my first thought is *what other whiskies* it reminds me of. Coming up with foods & moods is a bit of a struggle to be honest.

So I respect the effort that other people put in attempting to describe their drinking experiences, and I prefer to read those notes as evocative & impressionistic rather than precise. If there is a certain sameness to some of the notes, I'm guessing that is less a case of willful plagiarism and more than we can all lean on each other a bit in addressing a difficult task. "
Darn fancy Brits mixed some old Japanese whisky and sent me down the rabbit hole,"https://www.instagram.com/p/BvcjtkfBR8y/

This Boutique-y 21-year Japanese blend popped up randomly as a new item at the Norwegian wine monopoly (yes, literally) website. Expensive (2140 NOK/248 USD/190GBP for a 50cl bottle), but seemed unique and rare and previous batches had reviewed well. So I figured, what the heck, it'll be a Special Occasions whisky.

Turns out this particular batch was made for the Norwegian bar Dr. Jekyll, something the wine monopoly didn't mention. Being a relative whisky novice (only got into whisky about a year and a half ago), I have no idea if the flavor matches the price, and it's been too long since I opened and sampled it to start guessing at notes - but it IS good.

Anyone know anything about the blend here? I've been googling about, and it seems like it's all guessing. One reviewer at [Whiskybase](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/103667/japanese-blended-whisky-1-tbwc) thinks it's part Taketsuru.

Of course, getting this has sent me down the Gotta Try More Of Everything rabbit hole.

Since this purchase, I've added a 12-year Highland Park Viking Honour to the small collection (good and easily drinkable, better with a teensy bit of water). I've got a 10-year Bulleit bourbon, Cask Strength Four Roses, and an 18-year Glenmorangie on the way to the local store, and I'm eager to try them based on reviews.

(I would have the latter three already, but apparently they and most of the pallet they were on got smashed in a transportation accident. Whoops. Happy it didn't happen to rarer stock.)

(Edited to add the actual name of the whisky outside of the Instagram post.)","I just got this one, but felt gipped since I didn't realize it was 50cl when i dropped $200 USD on it

Anyway, I don't have any specific plan to open it but only purchased because of a couple glowing reviews that made it seem worth a try for sharing at a unique occasion. Glad you like it as well, but will definitely encourage you to try those new purchases and lots others - it sure is a rabbit hole! 

&#x200B;
> but seemed unique and rare and previous batches had reviewed well. So I figured, what the heck, it'll be a Special Occasions whisky.

If this appeals to you then you should check out compass box. Good mix of blends ranging from 50-200 with a couple rarer ones getting even higher. Call me a hypebeast but I find value in their design/packaging and enjoy the little stories around each blend too. 
Read this as 50ml the first time through. The thought of ordering a bottle thinking it was 750 and opening a box with an airline bottle inside gave me a good chuckle. 
Ouch. Though granted, even with that it ""only"" stays in the high price tier, not quite reaching the ""wtf insane only for collectors"" range.

My palate isn't nearly refined enough to keep going for the high tier whiskies. I'm gonna be happy exploring the flavors in less expensive whisky for a bit. That 18-year Glenmorangie is as expensive as I'll go, unless I come across good deals on rare stuff.
Thanks for the recommendation. I do keep hearing Compass Box mentioned as a good maker. The only one available in Norway right now without importing directly from foreign stores is the [Asyla](https://www.vinmonopolet.no/vmp/Land/Skottland/Asyla-Grain-%26-Malt-Blended-Scotch-Whisky/p/4484201) blend. Any experience with that? It's reviewing decently to well. 

Though I'm feeling like I ought to start exploring peat/smoke a little more, and I've already got the aforementioned three unpeated bottles on the way.

I figure next paycheck I'll be getting a bottle of Connemara, as supposedly that's a great intro to peated stuff.
That would REALLY suck!
Haven‚Äôt tried the asyla yet. That and hedonism are fighting for battle in my fun budget to be the next one I try. 

I thought I hated peaty stuff but then I found a bottle of compass box spice tree on sale at the store. The tasting notes said the peat was light and it was a good sale so I thought what the heck. Been hooked ever since. "
"My tipple for the evening - Old Pulteney 12yo from a Tasting set I got for Christmas! The overriding note on the nose was Victoria Sponge, oddly enough. Vanilla mixed with fruity berries. Indistinguishable fruity taste on the palate, with a very salty aftertaste. I‚Äôm glad I tasted this one first!",,"OP 12 is a good dram, I've killed more bottles of it than any other scotch. Glad you are enjoying it.
Unfortunately, what I meant was I‚Äôm glad I got this one out of the way first! I found the aftertaste far too salty, and generally a bit disappointing.
Oh, sorry about that. 

Which version was this, the 40% ABV version sold in the UK (700 ml) or the 43% ABV version sold in the USA (750 ml)?
I‚Äôd assume it was the UK version, it came in a Tasting set I got for Christmas so I don‚Äôt know for sure!"
"This evening‚Äôs tipple, bought on my honeymoon in Scotland last year. Fruity on the nose, I noticed cherry in particular.

My wife and I decided that we were just going to pack whatever we wanted into the suitcase and if it smashed, it smashed! I had this bottle, a small bottle of Glenkinchie, a mini bottle of Singleton of Dufftown, and my wife had several gins. 

We also had cans of beers and premixed cocktails which we‚Äôd bought for our honeymoon and hadn‚Äôt drunk, so we applied the same principal! Internal flight from Inverness to Luton, and every bottle and can was in perfect shape when we landed!"
Auchentoshan and Aberlour - how are 'rich fruits' supposed to taste?,"Dear gentlemen,

I recently purchased a bottle of unchillfiltered Aberlour and a Three Wood Auchentoshan. 

The latter had a quite present taste of wood, rounded with notes of smoke and a faint reference to chocolate. Yet I totally failed to taste the 'rich fruits' that the package claimed to be a major part of the taste.

The Aberlour was - according to its label - supposed to taste like plums, chocolate/caramel, cinnamon and rasins. Yet I could only taste faint notes of the plums.

Now I am a bit confused because I expected all these tastes to be very present, compareable to the intensity of smoke in a Laphroaig.

Was I misled by my expectations or do I simply have malfunctioning taste receptors? 
","Everybody experiences tastes in his own way, but I can assure you that no flavors will be as strong as the smoke or a Laphroaig, the sherry of a 'sherry bomb' or the vanilla from first make American oak. All these other flavors, apples, raisins, fields or grass, moist forests, etc. are all 'secondary', their interpretations of flavors that come from something else. I mean, the smoke is really there, so is the sherry of a sherrybutt, but should a drink be vatted in cherrywood (I have one such) it's not whisky, because it didn't age in oak, so when you taste cherry, it has to come from 'somewhere else' and consequentially can hardly be as strong as the flavor from a 'primary' source.
The tasting notes on the label have been primarily written to sell the product and dont necessarily accurately reflect how it tastes to most people. I tend to ignore them
Many thanks for this splendid explanation. 
Do I understand correctly that there is a primary taste and then some - to a varying degree - less present secondary tastes?
Ohh, I see. So obvious and still I fell for it. Thank you. :)
Well, that actually just me trying to explain my thoughts, but you can imagine that a taste that is actually in the material itself (the vanilla of 'virgin oak' or the smoke from the drying of the malt) has a different effect than a taste that is mostly a by-product of the combination of the other elements. Nothing ever happens to whisky with apple-wood, yet there is apple in some whiskies. It would be quite a feat if that apple taste would be as strong as the sherry that is actually in the wood that contains the whisky.
The taste of peat, smoke, oak and sherry come from things that are actually present in the whisky in their original form - peated and smoked malt, charred barrels, or oak and sherry leached from the wood. If you taste those in whisky, you're tasting those actual things - they're objectively present. 

The 'secondary' tastes aren't physically present - there's no plum, vanilla or caramel in whisky or whisky barrels. Those tastes come from compounds present in the whisky which are *suggestive* of those flavours, leached from the barrel and its previous fills, altered by the slow chemical reactions as the spirit matures. These are subjective flavours - just because one person tastes nutmeg, honey or sultanas, doesn't mean another person will.

So it's less that they're primary or secondary flavours, more that they're actual and perceived flavours. 
Thank you very much for spending your time explaining this. I appreciate it. :)
Thank you very much for taking the time to explain this. I appreciate it. :)
No problem!

The chemistry of whisky is very interesting, if you're into that kind of thing. The compounds formed during production (mostly in the barrel) are hugely varied, and appear in other foods too. So although there may not be vanilla in whisky, there will be vanillin from the oak - the same chemical that's in artificial vanilla flavouring. There won't be actual nutmeg or cloves, but eugenol - a compound that also occurs at high concentrations in those spices - may form during maturation. 

This is how those 'secondary' flavors form, and also why, although people may disagree as to whether a whisky has cinnamon, star anise or cloves in the aroma, they'll generally agree that it smells spicy. 

https://www.compoundchem.com/2015/03/31/whisky/ is a good introduction - detailed, but readable - if you're interested. 
Many thanks for the interesting information. I shall read it at once."
Glen Flagler - Anyone tried it?,I managed to get a box of roughly 90 miniatures. One of them is a Glen Flagler and I was wondering if anyone had tried it and had any tasting notes?,"Why don't you try it and then deduce your own tasting notes?
I had one once at The Grill in Aberdeen (the 1973 in the fancy box) - it was OK, but no wow factor. Similar thing with the Killyloch 1967 I had at Dornoch Castle: not the best dram of the evening (in fact there were at least three that were better... and cheaper!).
Have been enjoying single malts for over 20 years and never came across Glen Flagler. So I googled it and found this: https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/b/40/glen-flagler-single-malt-scotch-whisky. It seems you have something quite rare. So enjoy!
Because I want help, that's why.
Yeah! It's crazy what I got in the box (I put up a video of what I pulled out :)). I've worked out that so far I'm up in about the ¬£550 mark. I have an old Johnnie Red and a Black which are currently up for sale at ¬£99.95 each so that's probably inflated the price. I'm going to be blogging about all of them, and videoing the tastings 'Living the dram' :)"
Ardberg Uigeadail - tasted and smelled awful,"I am not a Whisky drinker myself, but for Xmas got the girlfriend who is a bottle of Ardberg Uigeadail. A couple of weeks ago she had some folks over to run through a bunch of Irish and Scotch whiskys. I know on the Irish side there was a Redbreast, a Donegal, and a  Jameson. which to me were more or less the same, and drinkable, the others liked them all. There were a couple of Scotch whiskys (do not recall the name) that others liked. But the Ardberg was awful tasting, smelling, everything... Most said it smelled and tasted like formaldahide. Is that normal, or could there be a bad bottle? I had gotten it cause it had lots of great reviews, but I have to wonder if it was a bad bottle, or is really good whisky that awful?

&#x200B;

danka","Sounds like you walked in to Islay country without a map; Ardberg and Laphroaig are beasts for the initiated, but with time, you can love them, only took me best part of 20 years üôÉ
Got a girlfriend who is a bottle of Ardbeg Uigeadail.....

I wish my wife was one too.  Sometimes...

Anyway. Uigeadail can be a challenge.  if you are not very familiar with very heavily peated whisky it may smell and taste awful. 

you just need more whisky experience. 
If this is your first peated Scotch I would say the bottle is probably fine. The malt from which Ardbeg is made of is dried using a kiln fueled with peat which leads to a very smoky and often medicinal flavor. These whiskies can be rather polarizing, although they seen overall very popular on here.
Ah, reminds me of [this classic.](https://www.adweek.com/creativity/laphroaig-scotch-doesnt-mind-if-you-think-it-tastes-burning-hospital-158069/) Islay whiskies often taste like medicine, smoke, seawater, etc, and there are a whole lot of people that want nothing to do with them. For me, though, if I could only drink three distilleries for the rest of my life they‚Äôd all be within walking distance on that sweet sweet island. 
Bad bottle. Send it to me for proper disposal.
In addition to the Islay peated flavor like many others have said here, this is also a cask strength bottle at 55% or whatever vs the other whiskies which are at 40%-ish.  The alcohol smell and burn might be too overwhelming at that %.  I'd recommend trying to water it down gradually and nosing and tasting again to see how it evolves.
You should really look up tasting note before you buy.  That way you won't buy another tire fire in a bottle.  
You need more ice, like an iceberg sized chunk. Thats why its called Ardberg. Bitte


*lol theres enough srs comments here, lighten up a little. 
The smell is heavy like medicine, take nasty and heck and my tongue is on fire/numb. I'm going to kick my Unc @ss
I think no amount of initiation changes one's reaction to Islay scotches. You might work to learn an appreciation for them, but you love seems more an innate thing.

Me, I have loved Islay scotches since first sip. They may taste like a seagull's armpit preserved in band-aids, but it makes my tongue and nose sing to my soul.
Lmfao
I re-read that line about 5 times too and thought REALLY????
My favorite review from this campaign, was from this very proper gentleman that exclaimed ""It smells like a seagull's armpit!"" Lmao!
No ice! But water it down to some 40-50% alcohol might be an idea.
I couldn't stand Ardeg (especially) or any other peated whiskies the first time I tried them, now Ardbeg is up there with my other favourites which are also mainly peated.
I wasn't a fan of peated Scotch whiskies when I first tried them, but now I'm a serious peat freak, and Ardbeg Uigeadail is one of my favorites. Octomore, Lagavulin, and just about any Laphroaig are also high on my list!
Ah, so there is hope to convert others to the dark side."
How does one find the subtle 'taste'/notes of Whisky?,"Currently drinking (an albeit cheap) Whisky and it supposedly has notes of sour-apple & Vanilla, but I can taste neither vanilla nor sour apples. 

Granted, I'm not very used to strong liquor & so only really taste a burning sensation (along with some notes of something, but I can't discern any specific flavour) ","Don't sweat it, it'll probably come with experience.

One thing you can try is line up a few different pours (~1 oz each) side by side and compare them during one sitting. Try to pick out and describe the differences. Also, a tulip-shaped glasses like a glencairn can accentuate and intensify more subtle aromas.

You can also pull up a few reviews online for one of your pours and try to pick out descriptors that come up regularly. For instance, a lot of people pick up banana from JD. Many comment on Woodford Reserve having a metallic tasting finish. See if you can pick out those elements.

Thirdly, pay attention to the foods and beverages you consume. Think about how they taste. For instance, which flavor elements distinguish a strawberry from a grape? Go through your spice cabinet and sniff each one. Think about what each smells like and what makes it unique.
Try different ones and compare. 
Until you become accustomed to the alcohol level in whiskies, adding a small amount of water will cut it a little, and allow the flavors to come through. 
try tasting with different parts of the mouth. i start upfront only having the whisky near the tip of my tongue to feel for viscosity. Sherry and sweet notes mostly come forward here. then i will let it go farther back in the mouth and other tastes will come forward. for your tongue to pick up/send a taste to the brain etc. will take some time as well. don't rush/gulp. 

for the burning sensation: try to take a sip and then inhale with your mouth right after. it should help a little bit. but experience mostly will make the burn less and like others said the other foods/drinks you've had play a major role in that.
You are getting some good advice in this thread IMHO.

>I'm not very used to strong liquor & so only really taste a burning sensation

Once you get used to the higher ABV% of whisky, the aromas and flavors of the ethanol which are so dominant when you are starting out will probably recede into the background, allowing the more subtle stuff to be more easily noticed. 

This doesn't mean it will be easy to put names to those other flavors, but hopefully you should start noticing them more, even if they remain tantalizingly difficult to describe to somebody else.

Don't take tasting notes too literally. For myself, and I'm guessing a fair number of other folks too, they are intended to be evocative, painting an impressionistic portrait of an inherently subjective experience, not an account of factors which are objectively and reliably present. To quote Edna Mode: ""*Yes, words are useless! Gobble-gobble-gobble-gobble-gobble! Too much of it, darling, too much! That is why I show you*"".

But they are also the only tools we have for discussion, at least until such time as somebody invents a way to pass aromas & flavors over the internet.

Last piece of advice: Given how subjective & personal these experience are, and how relevant the phrase Your Mileage May Vary (YMMV) would seem to be, I'd suggest taking note with a touch of skepticism & restraint opinions re: whisky that you may encounter here or elsewhere which are expressed very forcefully & dogmatically.

Cheer & best of luck to you.
In danger of sounding like an old condescending prick; it's great that you're looking to develop an appreciation at a young age; my advice is just have fun and keep trying new whiskies, bourbons and ryes. 
There are some very generic one-dimentional brands out there; but you'll know a good one with character, when you taste it. 
Also, you're a young'un and your palate will change massively over the next few years.
Keep your eye out for bars or festivals where you can sample a few different brands. Most dedicated whisky bars run tasting sessions as well. As some others have suggested, you wouldn't go far wrong in getting a Glencairn glass, as these do help to capture the nose of the drink and can even help to single out the characteristics of whiskies that may otherwise get lost in a wide rocks glass. Cheers!
I've been drinking whisky for less than a year, and what I think helps is to go out and re-taste and smell the typical flavors found in whisky like vanilla, caramel, maple syrup, different fruits, etc...  I realized I had never really stopped to savor the flavor and scent of things like vanilla like I would when drinking whisky. In essence, to be able to discern a flavor you have to know and remember the flavor first.   Also, really helps with wine which I find to be much more subtle in flavor. 
My thoughts would be, discover how you like to drink whiskey first.

Example, I prefer my whiskey with ginger ale.  like 1/3:2/3 ratio.  Enjoy it.

Now, start trying different whiskey/bourbon/scotch in the same manner.  You will note the differences almost immediately.  I have had plenty of different types that don't taste to me like what they say they should, but I know how they differ from my standby or other favorites.

Don't let people tell you that you must drink this way or that way.  Find what you enjoy, then experiment.
[deleted]
You make it up...
The third one was something I just started doing. While I would research tasting notes, I'd start to realize stuff like ""I kinda forgot what toffee taste like"" hahah. One time when one of the notes was leather, I went to find my belt to take a quick whiff hahahah! 
Amusingly enough I found [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMw9ulsydgs) that gives suggestion of how to pick up different notes. 

The video say's to enter the whisky actively remembering the different notes, otherwise you won't be able to pick it up (as you won't know what to look for) 

Is this an accurate assertion?
Unfortunately as a young chap of twenty (and just started working for the first time as of last week) I haven't gotten the money to create a whisky collection. 

My first ever Whisky that I'm aiming for [is a Highlandpark 12](https://img.thewhiskyexchange.com/900/hlpob.12yov8.jpg) (as it was supposedly a very good Whisky for beginners) 


This is all a long way of saying; 'I don't have the Whisky to compare with'.


Tried it, didn't change anything, probably had way too little water (considering the amount of Whisky.)
> try to take a sip and then inhale with your mouth right after. it should help a little bit.

Yeah actually helped a lot!
Stalking my profile now? Why?
If people did there'd be no point in adding flavours to liquor..
sorry I didn't watch the whole video but if you're doing a blind tasting, it's helpful to remember a whisky's ""signature"" or ""thumbprint"". Some feature in the whiskey which sticks out to you as unique or distinctive. This is generally used by more advanced drinkers though

But like I said above, some whiskies have specific characteristics that most people agree exist in some form. Example: Beam often has a peanut-y funk. Lagavulin has iodine and smoke. Glenlivet has green apple and so on... Most people agree that it's reasonable to interpret these whiskies these ways. So you can try these whiskies and try to find those characteristics. 

Be careful not to read too deeply into reviews though. They're personal. Some reviewer's ""mango"" note could come off as ""papaya"" to me. Tasting notes are a lot less precise than people make them sound in reviews.
I personally think Highland Park sucks. Put it off for another paycheck and get Talisker, Springbank, Benromach or Bruichladdich. 
Nice! Another important thing to know: for me before i have a feeling of 'understanding' and getting to know a certain whisky, may take like half a bottle. Sometimes it takes a while for me to discover what makes a whisky great. 

When it comes to tasting certain tastes: most of them are done by some sort of free association, so take a sip, close your eyes and then just.. taste. what do you taste, what does it taste like.. what comes to mind. 
You‚Äôre lacking in the logic department. What I said supports the practice of adding flavor...
>Be careful not to read too deeply into reviews though. They're personal. Some reviewer's ""mango"" note could come off as ""papaya"" to me. Tasting notes are a lot less precise than people make them sound in reviews.


Yeah I've come to expect it from the videos. When two people can just spurt out different taste notes & disagree whether it's X or Y. It's subjective to a degree. 

But personally, right now, I don't even have a degree of subjectivity. It almost just tastes like alcohol & spices. 

I guess I'll just have to keep trying. Got any recommendations for a beginner? Any beginner Whisk[e]y's? Going to get my own Whisky in a month or two. 
I'm a beginner, I'm also not willing to spend a lot of money for a hobby that I am not even entirely into yet. 


[People have voted Highland Park 12](https://youtu.be/PoeIPrIXUOw?t=283) highly for beginners. It is only 39$ (where I live) and it's not too pricey for a beginning, in my opinion. 

If anything, the 'obvious' notes of Highland Park 12 (the smokey notes) should allow me to pick that up, and know what to look for. 
I used to agree, but got introduced to Magnus and it has now become my ""everyday"" whisky. Great price for a pour after a long day. 
I'm sorry, as I've stated in the OP I've had whisky  (and I am a lightweight)

I interpreted your comment as a person making up a 'note' of (e.g) Vanilla when it is in fact not there. I.E: The one tasting it is just pretending. 


If this interpretation is accurate, that would make the effort of adding flavour pointless, what would be the point of adding flavour if all flavours are 'made up'?



Read all these guides, I wrote them

u/recommendation_bot
I don‚Äôt believe in the whole whisky for beginners thing. Bad whisky is bad whisky, and the current Highland Park 12 is bad. 

I don‚Äôt know whether Highland Park‚Äôs popularity on Reddit is the result of brigading, marketing, nostalgia or a combination, but it sucks now. Unless you can find a bottle of Highland Park 12 that looks like this https://www.thewhiskyvault.com/highland-park-12-year-old-nineties-70cl-bottling-with-tube-3690-p.asp it‚Äôs going to be quite mediocre. The high ratings for Highland Park from Michael Jackson and other critics are based on the 1990s version, which is nothing like the modern HP12. Obviously, they have made numerous sacrifices to increase production and keep the price low. 

Talisker 10 Year Old is $23 more expensive and much better. Springbank 10 is about the same. Don‚Äôt waste your hard earned money on swill. 
Nothing about it is a great price for anything, it‚Äôs expensive sourced whisky created by a consultant (very talented consultant). This kid is not rolling in money, he is trying to get something he will enjoy at a reasonable price.

**General Tips**    
We generally advise novices to sample as much as possible by going to a bar, splitting bottles with friends, attending festivals/tastings or getting minis to ensure you buy bottles you enjoy. It may make more sense for you to focus on sampling rather than buy full bottles at the beginning of your journey.

I think the HP thing is about price, availability and profile (it has a bit of everything). Plus it has very mild, approachable and floral peat. Also, it's a good bottle to ""ease into"" the world of peat since some people seem to get so anxious about peat (they shouldn't)

But in general, I agree, spend $5-10 more and you can find much better bottles with a profile that's in the same neighborhood. I think the hype has carried over from when their bottles were higher quality.
So I bought my first Whisky yesterday. It is a 10 year old Laphroaigh.


In retrospect it's a poor beginners choice. It's very smokey, to the point of nearly hitting you in the face with it. 

But I like it. It brings back some memories that I'm fond of. I think the nose (smell) is better than the taste, but the taste's good still. 



I feel that, I need whiskeys that have very prominent tastes, so that I can later find them in their subtle formats in other Whiskeys. Any examples of Whisky that has strong notes of maybe vanilla? 



Also tried the Whiskey 'on the rocks' (with actual rocks, not ice) and it does tame the Whiskey considerably, and it's still good, but it's a different profile. Pleasant, but for different situations (imo). 

Any input? Advice?



The first time I had Lagavulin (bear in mind that this was back in 2004 and Lagavulin's profile and quality have changed considerably since then), I found it quite unpleasant. However, I had another dram, and another and then my palate (which I acknowledge is actually in my brain) adjusted to the profile enough that I understood what was so good about it. Now, I could taste all sorts of subtle aspects of it that I hadn't before. And I kept buying it again and again, and then there was this one point where Lagavulin changed for the worse and never went back. These ""new"" bottles started hitting the shelves around 2008 or 2009. The bright acidic punch was lost. Now it tasted like a bland miso soup or something. Sad. 

Laphroaig 10 Year Old has also gone through some negative changes. It's very peaty and punchy now, whereas it used to be smooth, sweet, fruity and medicinal. The good news is that you can find the real Laphroaig flavor for a decent price in the Cairdeas and the Lore. They are more expensive, but still under $100. I don't know if the old Lagavulin flavor can still be found for less than $500. 

>Any examples of Whisky that has strong notes of maybe vanilla? 

I'm not big on vanilla bombs myself, but have you considered Glenmorangie 10 years old? It's actually quite good for the price. I'd say it's more of a cereal grain with flowers profile, and it's always been quite consistently appealing. 

Glengoyne has a pleasant ""scotchy"" flavor (that phenolic furniture polish taste that most people associated with blended whiskies) and a decent hit of vanilla. 

Springbank is really interesting for its coconut notes. Talisker has an undeniably peppery profile. I think those are some good unique drams that will give your liquor cabinet some variety. 

If you really want vanilla, you can get a high end blend like Compass Box Asyla or a high end grain blend like Compass Box Hedonism. There are others, but price-wise, Compass Box is quite accessible. 

>Also tried the Whiskey 'on the rocks' (with actual rocks, not ice) and it does tame the Whiskey considerably, and it's still good, but it's a different profile. Pleasant, but for different situations (imo). 

I do this every so often, but mainly when I am forced to drink a whisky that I don't find all that compelling.

[This one?](https://www.systembolaget.se/dryck/sprit/glenmorangie-41701)

> but mainly when I am forced to drink a whisky that I don't find all that compelling. 

Yeah I see the logic in that. Cooling the Whisky down does considerable tame the tastes, so if the Whisky isn't all that pleasant/compelling, calming it down can make it less unpleasant as you don't have to taste all that which makes it unpleasant in the first place. 


Thanks!
Yes, that one. 

Exactly.

Based on the website you linked to, I am assuming you are from Sweden. Beautiful country. I hope I get to visit there again someday. "
The best thing I've done for myself is move to blind tasting,"Incoming long post. I've been an on and off whiskey fan for years and years. I'll go through waves of being super into it, and then swing back to being super into beer or cocktails. As I do with all my hobbies. The point is that I've amassed a reasonable collection, nothing insane, but enough to have a great variety. The problem is that I've never really been great at picking out aroma or tastes in those whiskeys. I'll pour one of my bourbons and just go ""yup, that's a good bourbon"", but never get the nuances everyone else mentions. Same with scotch to a degree. I'll be able to pick out a region based on the overwhelming notes like smoke, peat (or lack thereof), etc, but never anything more. 

A week ago I was making dinner and told my girlfriend to go pick a bottle at random, pour a little, and don't tell me which one she picked. I was curious if I could get close at all. From the first smell it was like being handed a whole new liquor variety. It was sweet, fruity, full and complex. I still couldn't pull out a mile long list of specific scents, but I could pick up on a lot. I guessed it was a scotch, she said yes. So I kept trying it as I was making dinner. I got it down to two in my head, I never spoke a guess out loud until I was down to those two. I figured it was either aberlour a'bunadh, or glenmorangie quinta ruban. Nothing else I own would have that level sweetness or fruit. My gut reaction was the aberlour, but for some reason it wasn't hitting me with the alcohol strength that it had always overwhelmed me with in the past. I then over thought it and said well she's a port fan, she probably grabbed that one. I guessed the glenmorangie. I was wrong, it was the aberlour. 

That whole thing shocked me. I picked out so much more of what was in that whiskey not knowing what it was. I wasn't hunting for what others or even the box said was there, I was just trying to figure it out. 

Last night I asked her to do the same thing. Same experience. Right off the bat the one she picked had this musty odd smell that i'd found before, but can't accurately describe. It clearly wasn't scotch. I guessed something american, she said yes. It had none of the sweetness I usually get from bourbons, so I figured it was Rye. My selection of Rye is small, so that helps. It was that musty note that drove me. I was between Woodford Rye and Flag Hill (local distiller). But that musty note, it reminded me a lot of a smell that I'd found in Woodford's new Malt Whiskey, so I guessed Woodford. Wrong again, it was the Flag Hill. But again I had gotten down to two bottles and one of them was the correct bottle. 

I tried one more blind last night, and this one I did not get close at all. I knew it was bourbon, but I've always struggled with bourbon. I love the stuff, but it all tastes more or less the same to me, with some exceptions. This one, the nose was just brown sugar with something else altering it that I couldn't put my finger on. It stunned me, I couldn't remember ever having one that smelled like that. Taste was sweet and mild and echoed the smell. I really liked it, but I could not for the life of me place it. Turns out it was a bottle I forgot I had owned, Old forester 100, a bottle I had been hugely ambivalent on when I first got it. 


I know this was a long post, but I wanted to share. I figured maybe it could help others who like me read various reviews and just go ""what the hell are they on about?"" Those three blind tastings are the most I've ever been able to dive into a whiskey and really pick it apart. Something about knowing what it is up front points me at what I think it should be, and I hunt for that never finding it. Not knowing before hand really let me stop and actually explore. Give it a try sometime, it might shock you how close or far you get. ","Great post! Now try a few blind together so you can rank them relative to each other. Don‚Äôt do more than 3-4 as your palate gets fatigued beyond that
Blind tasting is awesome. I have so many preconceptions I didn't know I had (brand/age statement, etc) not just about quality but about flavour, too. Strip that away and you're picking out what's actually there and it's ACE! Just needs a bit of admin/a willing person to pour for you... "
"As someone who is new to whisky, but have tried many different bottles this week, there really is no such thing as ""bad"" whisky","So I've tried 21 different whisky's this week. 4 tasting sets and a average price Yamasaki distillers reserve NAS whisky . In the tasting sets I had all sorts raging from daily blends such as monkey shoulder to much more expensive bottles up to ¬£120. 

You read the reviews on websites such as masters of malt and anything under a certain price seems to always be around 3.5 stars with many people leaving 1 star reviews , saying, TERRIBLE. UNDRINKABLE YOUNG WHISKEY. NEVER AGAIN etc. You get the point. 

Now , before I get into the whisky , I used to drink tons of craft beer. I'm training for a marathon though so I have moved to spirits for the reduction in calories. The thing with craft beer is, out of the hundreds and hundreds of different beer I have had , I can count on one hand the number of beers I will never buy again. Yet even those I would still drink if offered to me. 

This goes with the whisky too. All these comments about TERRIBLE..I DONT KNOW WHY I TRIED A BLEND. GROSS. ONLY SINGLE MALTS.... It's just nonsense.

All the whisky I tried was good quality whisky . The price seemed not to reflect what was in the bottle. One of my favourites was laguvlin 16 at ¬£50 a bottle , And monkey shoulder which was like ¬£30. Then I had talisker 18, was my second most expensive one and I like that too.

But the thing is , I liked them all. They were all good. Just like all bacon is good. There was nothing UNDRINKABLE. I came into this thinking some of the cheaper stuff was going to be UNDRINKABLE lighter fluid. It's just not the case. Things don't get this far down the road to the point of being a distellery who's been making a whisky for over a hundred years and then, what, you think they can sell a UNDRINKABLE whisky to the masses? Utter nonsense.

I'm now about to go buy a supermarket finest blend ..(Tesco finest blended scotch) and I can guarentee that I will like it. 

Maybe it's just snobbery in the whisky world I don't know. But yea. ","It makes it interesting when you do find one that you don't like.
[deleted]
The crap isn‚Äôt *undrinkable*, it‚Äôs just crap.
How often do you eat a terrible inedible hamburger? Any restaurant that offered such a thing would not stay in business long. Same with whiskey
Try some American ‚Äúcraft‚Äù whiskey.

Most of Europe has laws and standards that more or less guarantee a drinkable product.  
I have the same problem, I seem to like every single one I taste APART from peaty ones. I love singles, singles that have spent years in sherry casks or the like and also blends.  I haven‚Äôt found an Irish whiskey I like yet though. The only thing I can do is keep trying I suppose.....

Anyone who think single malts are always superior to blends should try anything from mcCleland's and any compass box side by side.

Quality matters.

As for ""no such thing as bad whisky""....i beg to differ...there's plenty of trash out there...(see mccleland...among others).
No, it's just a matter of taste. I'm exactly the other way around. I drink whisky and beer, but I don't like 90% of it. That doesn't mean that I think the drink is bad, it's just not my taste. When it comes to whisky, I almost exclusively enjoy smokey and peaty ones. Too much sherry or bourbon in the flavor? I'll never drink it again. At home I have about 40 bottles of whisky. Most of them I may never empty. Now that I know my taste better, I don't 'mis buy' as often as I used to.  
  
Similar with beer. There are close to no dark beers that I like, same with IPAs. There are simply styles that don't fit my taste, most styles actually. Nothing to do about that and I don't really care either. It's just the way it it.
I agree partly. I also doubt there is such a thing as ""undrinkable"" whisk(e)y. But there definitely is whisky that tastes to me like it wasn't made for sipping but rather mixing into cocktails or coke. Best example to date still is JW Red Label. It has it's moments and I can see why it stands out in a mixed beverage, but I just can't seem to enjoy it straight.

However, this has nothing to do with ""Blend vs Single Malt"". That's nonsense. I do enjoy the JW Black Label, and the Green Label is one of my favorites. There are incredible blended malts out there, even single grains. On the other hand, I've given Single Malts like Auchentoshan 12 multiple chances and it always disappointed me.

Just my two cents. 
Get a Whisky, drink it to the last dram, 95% air, 5% Whisky, leave it for 5 years in the light. Taste it again. Other than that I agree, there is no bad Whisky just some better than others. üëå
I would dislike some whiskies over others. 

The 2 that come to mind were the Chita japanese grain, which was sharp and had a strong alcohol taste to it.
And the other was West Cork bourbon blend. Which was just....weak. Had very little flavour.
Needless to say, I finished both bottles. I would always judge a whisk[e]y when i've been through it entirely and not judge it on a neck pour.
So I agree with you. I don't think there are bad whiskies out there. But some do tend to have a lower quality than others. And some aren't worth the price tag they carry either.

I once bought some Canadian Club 12 year. It was horrid. It wasn't whisky. It was indescribable in flavor. At least for 22 year old me. I gave the bottle to my friend who at the time was more experienced in drinking. He couldn't swallow it. Now I'd been drinking since I was 18, as its my County's legal age, so I don't call this inexperience.

I'm convinced it was a bad batch. I've tried CC12 again recently and it was nothing like what I had ages ago. Maybe it doesn't count, but that was bad whisky.
Have you try Aberlour 12? 
Fireball Whiskey would destroy your statement.
I don't like certain whisky and for me Jack, Jim, Johnnie (red), and Crown must be mixed with something or it is undrinkable. But I agree with you, once out of those, whisky is really good and interesting.
>You read the reviews on websites such as masters of malt

IMHO I wouldn't suggest paying too much attention to the customer-submitted reviews posted on online retailer sites, except for the entertainment value. 

Too many of the reviews are not appropriately contextualized, between the people hating on perfectly well executed whiskies that just don't happen to fit their personal tastes (a problem you've noted) and the opposite problem in which a reviewer gives 5 out of 5 stars to an entry-level whisky saying ""this is the best whisky I've ever tasted"" and then it becomes painfully apparent that they've tried a grand total of 2 whiskies.

Reddit, various whisky blogs, whiskybase have a much higher signal to noise ratio.

IMHO, YMMV, etc.
There are great blends and not great blends.  Great single malts and not great single malts.  

A distiller can absolutely sell garbage as long as it gets you drunk for cheap enough. 

Blends can be far better than single malt.  It's pretty subjective.  I found a $20 blend that I think kicks the crap out of a number of under $50 single malts.  
The first whisky I had where I was happier dumping it down the sink  than drinking it was the Glenlivet Founder's Reserve. Horrid stuff. Before then I'd been relatively happy with just about any single malt Scotch. 
Yea all that white stuff comes out when you fry it?
I scrape that white stuff off and it's still good haha
America has very strict laws governing whisky too.
I'm in a simliar situation. I like almost every whisky, I absolutely _love_ the peaty ones, but I can't for the life of me stand rye.
Hmm funny. To me there‚Äôs nothing better than peated whisky and a nice porter. 

But that‚Äôs just personal taste I guess.  
I thought that was technically a liqueur?

America has a very large amount of types that can be produced, all with individual laws governing them.  Some are very lax and give virtually no guarantee in quality.  
I am not a rye fan so I often serve up rye to people when they come over to get rid of the stuff. So weird because the rye is almost always their favorite. It must be an acquired taste.
Well, figuratively it is shit, but it counts as a ""American Whisky Blend."" I've only ever seen it displayed with other American Whiskys, usually on the lowest shelf near the plastic jugs.

I don't honestly know if it's counted as a liqueur, but I've not seen it in that section at my Liquor stores. I'd have to deffer to a mixologist on that.
I think american beer for the most part is crap. American whiskies can compete on an international level.
There are over 6,300 breweries in America.  To dismiss them all as ""crap"" is one of the more ignorant things you can do.  Also, why did you even bring it up? This is a whiskey discussion.  
never said all. Was contrasting to whisky in America
I still don't understand what point you are trying to make?

There is good and bad whiskey from America.

There is good and bad beer from America. 
"
What is the taste of bananas?,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I was wondering if someone can tell me what the faint and (in my opinion) unpleasant taste of banana is in some whisky. I've noticed that two distillers that get reviewed well and cost around $100 per bottle have it. Starward and Hellyers Road in Australia to be specific. Not Hellyers Road's Pinot Noir finish, that lacks it, or at least it's very subtle and hidden by the green apple freshness that it has. Is that intentional? By the way, Limeburners Infinity absolutely blows my mind if you're after any interesting Australian whisky. Don't get me wrong, Starward and Hellyers Road are great - it's just that banana taste that nags at me.","isoamyl acetate
I've found a lot of bourbon cask finished whiskies have this present. For reference go smell a bottle of Jack or Makers, it smells just like bananas!
Hellyers road uses the barley from the beer industry in Tasmania. From memory it‚Äôs the cascade barley variety. It produces a slightly more buttery mouthfeel but I‚Äôve never got bananas from it.  
Now you‚Äôve got me thinking, I‚Äôve got an excuse to have a Monday arvo bevvy.  

Edit: see other comment 
So I just had a small dram of hellyers road single cask (68.3%abv) and i had a whiff and a sip and then smelled the cavendish bananas in the fruit stand (ripe, with small brown spots, just for reference) and I can see that maybe there is a fruity note of banana skins under there.  
Being a different bottle to yours (unless by some miracle you have cask number 4183.03) ymmv.  
Btw, I get hay and toast on the nose with a peppery finish. Maybe some light clover honey too. 
Great thread. I bloody hate bananas in anything. Disgusting fruit. However, in Brenne whisky, I found that it worked so well!
[deleted]
What's the deal? It tastes bad. Is it supposed to be there or is it the mark of a poor whisky?
> a lot of bourbon cask finished whiskies have this present

What are you calling a bourbon cask ""finished"" whisky?  Most whisky in the rest of the world is aged (full-term) in American ex-bourbon barrels.
> it‚Äôs the cascade barley variety

I know cascade is a hops variety, but it's also a barley variety?
On the nose the banana is most prevalent, but I do feel like it overshadows the better notes that you're talking about. The hay and toast I was thinking of warm dry grass, so we're getting that across their range. I'm drinking the 10yo.

Hellyers Road Pinot Noir offsets this by having this light green apple tartness and it allows all those other flavours to rush forwards, making it a great experience. Thanks for your notes!
[removed]
That‚Äôs green apple
Isoamyl acetate is an ester produced by yeast as a fermentation byproduct. Some strains of yeast produce more than others, and isoamyl acetate production can be further accentuated by fermenting at too high a temperature. A perfect example is Jack Daniels house yeast, which is why all their products have some concentration of isoamyl acetate.
Lots of people like banana...
Whisky contains hundreds of flavor & aroma compounds.  They cannot be controlled individually.  So I just consider whatever you find in a whisky to be the product of the entire process, and you either like a whisky or you don't.

I haven't had those Australian whiskies, so I can't comment on them specifically.  I find banana notes to sometimes be present in spirits I would consider under-aged, but there are several fine U.S. bourbons that can also have banana notes.  Whether you consider them poor is up to you.
I'd say it's a ymmv thing. I personally enjoy tropical and banana notes in my whisky and very much enjoyed the Hellyers Road. Yet I can't stand the strong dark chocolate and coffee notes in heavily sherried whiskies. 
Funny he says this too. I'm a HUGE fan of Starward. 

&#x200B;

The banana is not-so-subtle in their Wine Cask bottle, however the bourbon they released just recently had no Banana from what I could taste. 
I could be mistaken. 
It‚Äôs a shame you are getting such an unbalanced note on your dram. It‚Äôs not the best whiskey in Australia, but it is interesting and worth a try in my opinion. 
[deleted]
That's a fact. A lot of people like anchovy too.
The purple flower that grows at the end of a banana cluster is known as a Banana Blossom or Banana Heart. It is often used in South Asian and Southeast Asian cuisine, either raw or steamed with dips or cooked in soups, curries and fried foods. The flavor resembles that of artichoke. As with artichokes, both the fleshy part of the bracts and the heart are edible.

Two idiot bots in a row. 
Bad bot. 
Obviously the stuff from Sullivan‚Äôs cove is consistently good but fuck me it‚Äôs overpriced. I had the French oak back when it was only 300 a bottle - what a bargain! 
Nant produces good stuff, but if you can find it (it‚Äôs near impossible as far as I can tell) the now defunct cradle mountain sells off the remaining stock on a yearly basis, the last dram I had was from the 17 year old and it was a real treat. It‚Äôs a shame they went out of business, they had some talent and I think the preceded the market by about ten years. If they held on till the international market caught wind of how good Australian whiskeys can be, they‚Äôd be sorted for sure. 
Worst bot."
"Hello and a one of my favs, Tomatin Dualchas","Hello all, new to the group and my first post.  Hope I‚Äôm not breaking any rules!

Thought I would send out a review of one of my favorites for your review and discussion.

**Tomatin Dualchas** single malt is very light and smooth, almost sweet from being aged bourbon and virgin oak casks.  This is an excellent beginners whisky.  But, the best part is the cost!  My local liquor store has it for $22.95 for a 750 ml bottle.  Another store nearby had it on special for $19.99 and I bought 3 bottles.  My wife and I toured the distillery when in Scotland a few years ago, so I‚Äôm familiar with them.  It‚Äôs up near Inverness and a nice small shop.

Note that I am Scot by heritage but my family has been in the US since the mid-1800‚Äôs.  When I found out my heritage I ‚Äúforced‚Äù myself to learn to enjoy Scotch and am glad I learned the secret of adding a little water to open it up and smooth it out.

","I'm honestly a pretty big fan of Tomatin. The quality is quite good for the price imo. I got my buddy hooked on it too as a regular in his collection; he was all over Ardbeg before that. 
I was reading your posts and read this one and I‚Äôm also a huge single malt fan and didn‚Äôt know about adding a few drops of water and what a difference! Much smoother, takes out the harshness, much more enjoyable. Thank you.
I live in New Jersey and buy 1.75 L bottles of Glenn Fiddich 12-year-old for $109. We spend three months in the winter in Florida and last year the same bottle was $80. We‚Äôre heading down to January and I‚Äôll pick up at least a case to take back lol.
Nice one! I'll give it a go! Thanks for the hint!  
I'm a big Balvenie 12 double wood drinker for the same reason, it's the best affordable whisky I could find, it punches well above its price range.
Yes, this is the ""secret"" many are not aware of.  When we visit Scotland I found all the pubs either have a pitcher of water, or an actual water tap available for each patron to add water to their whisky as they please.  I saw some Scots almost filling their glass up to the top with water so this is the norm there.

I'll add more to the islay peated expressions as I prefer to tame that taste down, but the idea is for each to add the amount of water that makes it taste good to them.  Enjoy!
We have a lot in common lol. Also based on one of your post I am now wheeling HAL and USB. I manage eight family accounts about 3.5 million. I‚Äôm doing primarily big tech also a number of recommendations from MarketClub which is an option service. You‚Äôve written that each individual investor needs to do their research, etc. and I value your advice and respect your opinion, if you have a couple of conservative names that you like, and would like to share them I would appreciate that.

Mortlach 19yo 1997 Single Cask bottling by Master of Malt ‚Äî thoughts?,"So I recently found someone selling this bottling for a ridiculously cheap price, and I couldn‚Äôt seem to find any review of this dram except from the Master of Malt website, of which there were tasting notes, and only two customer reviews. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just suspicious of the price or maybe the seller doesn‚Äôt know any better üòÇ anyone here have a taste of that already? How is it? Wouldn‚Äôt want to waste money on something I probably wouldn‚Äôt enjoy.

MoM tasting notes seem fine, but more feedback is more than appreciated. Thanks! 

","Only you know what you like. If you‚Äôre only buying it because you think it‚Äôs a good deal then you probably don‚Äôt really want it. 
While I haven't tasted any of MoM's single cask bottlings, I did try a bottle from their ""Darkness!"" range and really, really enjoyed it. If the Mortlach is indeed ""ridiculously cheap"", I'd give it a shot. My 0.02 ‚Ç¨.
[Whiskybase](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/92545/mortlach-1997-mom) is usually a good indication for price.
There are a handful of distilleries that really shine for me as 20+ year old 100% sherry cask bottlings, and Mortlach is one of them. 

Glen Grant and Longmorn as well. 
I'd get it if the price is well below what is showing at that whiskybase link. The tasting notes sound really good and in my experience the MoM tasting notes are reasonably on point, allowing for a slight amount of marketing fluff; I've never felt terribly misled by them.

Since the OB core range went badly downhill IB is the way to go with Mortlach.
I recently just finished my bottle of Mortlach 17, I say get it. Definitely one of my favourite malty whiskeys.
Well, comparing how other people like it certainly helps in the whole decision-making process I think. But thank anyway. 
Thank you for that heads up! I hope MoM is consistent enough in their bottlings! 

Will definitely report if it‚Äôs good!
Found it! Yep, definitely underpriced! Thanks for the lead!
Yes! Was able to taste the Longmorn 16, though they said the old bottling was way better than the purple box! 
Thanks! That was my worry since this particular bottling was made by them so I was on the fence with trusting the notes MoM gave, maybe some sort of marketing hoopla. 

Definitely getting the bottle before they realize the price point! 
I assume you just followed my link, right? :-)
Haha I actually typed it up in my browser so I had to ‚Äúfind‚Äù it. Saw it from a phone notif lol"
BYOB Tasting what a night!,"Had our first BYOB tasting on the 17th and it went really well. We had a massive selection of whiskies from blends to grains to malts through to hybrid whiskies from Compass Box. 

I supplied bread, cheese, ham and cheese biscuits to give members a break from the booze. 

We started at 19:00 and finished at 23:30 after sampling 14 whiskies. Notes were made and will be added to a database that we're creating for our members to use and expand. 

It was a fabulous way to try whiskies without having to shell out for an over-priced dram, or a whole bottle. Can't wait for the next one. 

If you're in Exeter, England (or close by) and fancy joining us, pop along to exeterwhiskysociety.wordpress.com and have a look at what we're doing. ","I'm nowhere near Exeter, but I approve of what you're doing and wish Nottingham had something like this.

You, sir, have a drinking problem. It's ok though, I'm willing to take the whisky off your hands.

Seriously though that sounds amazing. It's a shame trains in the UK are so slow otherwise I'd join you guys for a dram or two!

Where are you actually based?
Why thank you kind sir. 

I'd asked around the local specialist shops in town but none of them were any help when I was looking for groups, clubs or society's

No worries, I've had the same problems :)
Ah, that would be an epic journey just for a booze up :)"
Tomatin 12,"Am I alone in thinking Tomatin 12 tastes strangely like brandy? Sure, it is finished in sherry, but it is much more than that. I get these musty notes both on the nose and palate that remind me of Armagnacs like Samalens, as well as a soft grape note that smells like a pisco or a grappa.

Don't get me wrong, it is very delicious and interesting. I'm just wondering if anyone else agrees that this very unique whisky is brandy reminiscent. ","Not sure how the modern Tom 12 is, but I bought a bottle of the old label (for $20 even) and downed in a week. Tasted like candy. There was nothing special about it, but it was easy drinking for sure. It definitely had a very sweet, grapey wine character that wasn't typical of your usual sherried variety. I'd assume they used PX at the time. It would make sense, given how fruity the base profile of Tomatin already is. No clue what Tomatin is doing now for their newer bottlings.
Lovely stuff
It can be, but Tomatin also has a number of specifically finished options. Tomatin 12, Oloroso, Manzanilla, Single Malt, Bourbon/Sherry Cask, French White Oak...

I'd say there is a Brandy likeness to it, but it really depends on which specific edition you are looking at.
Sorry, what is PX?
This was the Bourbon/Sherry finished which I understood to be their standard bottling. 
Pedro Ximenez.  The sweetest type of sherry there is.
No, their standard bottling is Tomatin 12. Has a black label with a red band. No special cask finishing.
Gotcha"

May I suggests to add 1Password integration on the login/signup page?
It would help a lot in terms of user experience.
Thanks OP, I'm a novice whisky drinker and a mobile developer myself and I've been looking for a good whisky app. Will give this a try. Hit me up if you need any help with backend or native development. 
You have a typo on your website üòÉ
WISKY MOMENTS
Take a picture to share your Whisky Moment with your friends
Interesting, what makes your app stand out against others such as Whizzky and Distiller?
Gave the app a workout this morning by adding my collection of 25 bottles. I use Distiller but two things I like more about this app (1) I love the barcode scanner. Not sure why Distiller never added this feature and (2) it‚Äôs easier to add purchase info and notes. 

Roughly 1/3 of my bottles were not in your app but I noticed they were quickly updated shortly after I finished. 

It looks like a promising app. Thanks!
Love how it's rated for teens. Haha
Nice work. One feature I'd love to see would be to sort deals by percentage reduction. Would make scanning the top deals much easier.
Sorry. Sadly I do not. 
I can't make an account because I'm not 21, despite being of legal drinking age in my country. Is this a Google Play ToS thing? 
We've updated the Drammer app to v1.8 with a 10x faster timeline loading and new currencies: CHF, DKK, SGD, BGN, NZD, ZAR. More info http://get.drammer.com
It‚Äôs Untappd for whiskey. 

MOSTLY GEARED FOR EUROPE?
Make sure to checkout the ""taste filters"" on the search page. It will definitely help you discover new whiskies :)
Thanks for your suggestion, we'll put it on the suggestion list. 

We have have thought about this when developing the app. The conclusion was that users do not have to login very often. With our limited development resources we chose to focus on features which affected everyday use of the app. Nonetheless it could be a nice addition in the future :)
Good observation :) I've corrected the typo, thanks!
I think user friendly user interface, search by whiskies by taste, a timeline where you can share your friend's activities, 21,000 daily updated prices and 800 whisky deals (although this might be less interesting for non NL / BE / DE / UK citizens).

What we hear from our users is they tried several whisky apps, and decided to stick with Drammer. They liked the features and the found it suitable for beginner as well as expert whisky lovers.
Thanks! you must be Scott on Drammer ;) I saw you adding a lot of missing bourbons so I quickly looked up and cutout the bottle shots  to make them all into the database.

We chose to use a barcode scanner on purpose. We thought about a label scanner but it involved machine learning, image recognition algorithms and lots of time. A barcode works simple once you got them :)

The only downside is bottles which do not have a barcode. However I wonder about the accuracy of a label scanner when it needs to determine the small differences in cask numbers on a label of an independent bottler.
I guess you are referring to the Apple rating? I still think it is weird the age rating is determined by answer some questions and not being able to voluntary increase the minimal age :)
Actually this is already in the app :)

In the top right (as shown in https://yourwhiskyapp.com/public/img/screenshots-android/android-whisky-deals.png) you see an up/down arrow icon. Tap this and the sorting menu shows up where you can sort by discount price, percentage etc. 
It has indeed to do with legal stuff. Whisky is a high percentage alcohol drink therefore the minimal age is 21. For beer and wine the minimal age is 18.
Not at all, but we had to start somewhere. If you have suggestions to make it less ""European"", please let me know :)
I've just added 13 new US whisky events to the calendar :)
I certainly will, thanks again 
I agree, you only login once, or twice, but I think that it also helps in terms of feeling: when I find that a developer thought about the login process and actually implemented 1Password integration, it makes me think good thinks about the app in general.

It‚Äôs like thinking ‚Äúyou took time to implement this detail, it means that your work is of a higher value‚Äù

But true, you need to prioritize resources...
I noticed the barcode scanner requires the bottle to be somewhat generic. Wild Turkey Rare Breed and Bookers are good examples where I have to put ABV or release notes in, well, the notes section :)

Did you notice that sorting my collection by date sorts by date added? I was expecting it to sort by purchase date. 

I don‚Äôt know that it matters this time next year after I‚Äôve replaced most of my collection. 

Looking forward to adding my first badge. 


Ahh I missed that. Thanks.
Do you not think you could implement a country based age restriction? Like how a lot of alcohol websites do? Because if I can walk into a liquor store and buy whisky myself, I should be able to talk about it on an app. 
How about taking into account where the person is from (country) and adjusting the defaults/preferences for the user from that. 

Example: I‚Äôm from USA but when I click on whisky deals it‚Äôs all from Germany. Make it so my deals would be from USA or at least let me chose what country the deals are from.


Just something I thought would help. Not trying to be critical cause I think the app is cool.

Nice job
That's an interesting perspective. When I'm asked whether I want an app or device to remember my password, it tells me the developer probably knows better but feels obliged to cater to people who prioritize convenience over security. After all, security is the point of a password.
It doesn't have to be generic, it depends on the distiller. Some distillers give all editions of a certain whisky one barcode. The thing with some single barrels etc. is that we want to avoid having hundreds of the same expression in our database. When there is a specific cask number we add them separately.

As for the sorting, I agree. I'll put it on our todo list. We currently focus on server speed first. With all the new users, the server needs some optimisation :)
We can for sure, but as a startup we have to choose where to put our development resources. I'll put it on our suggestion list :)
Feedback is always appreciated! In the end it makes the app onlu better :)

In the preferences you can set the countries you wish to see the shops / whisky deals from. Currently we support The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom. Unfortunately we do not have any USA shops listed.
I couldn‚Äôt do without 1Password, with the endless leaks of passwords and personal details, the best practice is using different passwords for each login.
With more than 300 passwords it would be impossible without reusing passwords or resorting to other less secure alternatives... 
Lastpass is a solid alternative
Small update, I just contacted the Dutch authorities. They confirmed I am legally allowed to set the minimal age to 18. This will be updated in the next release.
Yes I saw that.  Hence my comment above. The app looks to be geared towards Europe....

I‚Äôm sure you will make additions and look forward to using the app then. 
I guess I just trust my memory more than I trust a hackable database.
Do you have suggestions of whisky festivals to add or online shops which are common in the US?
I‚Äôm sorry, sadly I do not, "
What's a good whisky to gift to my boyfriend?,"Hello there,

My boyfriend is a learning bartender and recently taste tested a lot of different whisky and scotch at his new job. He has a new appreciation for whisky and I was wondering what a good whisky might be to give to him. 

I don't know anything about whisky, my dad recommended Johnnie Walker Black Label 12 and also mentioned Glenfiddich and Glenlivet? However I've read very mediocre reviews about them on here.

I'm a total noob about this so I'm possibly looking for something that he probably won't hate, and will be good to keep at home. 

Thanks much!","Are you looking to impress him by spending a lot, or introduce him to something new, or ... ? This will be difficult if he's a professional bartender, I'd think. He has access to try all kinds of stuff at work.

If you really want to get him whiskey, it might be good to find out if he prefers Scotch, bourbon, Irish whiskey, or rye. No use spending $250 on a bottle of Scotch if he doesn't like Scotch.

However, you said he's learning to make cocktails, right? So, why not a gift which will help him practice at home?

Does he have a good cocktail-making set? Glasses, a shaker, atomizer, the pouring thing? Just search google for ""barware set"" or ""[cocktail set](http://www.drinkstuff.com/products/cocktail-sets.asp)"".

Does he have all the little ingredients you need to make cocktails like grenadine, ginger liqueur, luxardo, chartreuse, benedictine, cointreau, bitters, etc? You could get several 375mL bottles of different ingredients for his home bar.

There are also numerous books on the history of cocktails, how to make them, etc.
/u/recommendation_bot
Maybe gift him a set of glasses to drink whisky - Look for Glencairn or nosing glasses. Which whisky to gift is not so trivial to answer, since we don't know anything about his tastes or your budget. 

A pretty low price and a good start could be the ""Glenfiddich 12 years"". It's nothing special but it's a balanced Speyside whisky that some consider to be a benchmark to compare other whiskys too.
DYC
If he has a new-found appreciation for whisky I would say to get him something a bit more complex and a bit special. I'd suggest the multi-award winning Talisker 10 Year Old - beautifully balanced with a subtle smokiness. Have a look here for some more suggestions of quality Whisky www.whiskygiftguide.com
As a bourbon drinker I really appreciate the sneaky picks. Old Charter, Very Old Barton, Weller, & Old Grand Dad are all younger, cheaper versions of what can be expensive whiskey. 
Several Questions First:

How much are you wanting to spend?

What whiskies has he tried and liked?

Does he, in general, like sweet, smoky, mild, strong, nutty, or fruity flavors?

Where are you located (it may help by limiting some options not regionally available)?
Glenlivet's sort of mass market and that hurts its reputation a bit.   I think they brew some pretty tasty whiskies but they fall far on the sweet end so if your taste runs towards peppery or smoky Scotch, it is sure to disappoint.   Depending on the part of the world you live in, Glenlivet 12 is likely to be widely available for a reasonable price.   Glenlivet in some areas also markets a gift pack that has samplers of the 12, 15, and 18.   This is a nice little package that lets you see how a distillery can market different flavor profiles under different age statements.   

JW Black, Glenlivet 12, and Glenfiddich 12 are all what I'd characterize as entry level scotches.   If your BF isn't heavy into midrange or higher Scotch, these would all be acceptable bottles that are fairly easy to find.   

Can you provide us with an estimated budget and any whiskies (doesn't matter if its Scotch) you know he likes? 
What is your budget?  JW black, glenlivet, and glenfiddich are good entry level bottles for under $45 a bottle
I'm new to the whisky game still. I like heavy drinks and drink them straight (heavy drinks meanig I like a lot of flavor, and am not afraid of bitter). My favorite by far is 4 roses single barrel. It has a sharp taste, and is almost spicy. I can only have a glass or 2 at a time. Good sipping whisky. I don't think he'd be disappointed. 

If not try knob creek. These are both bourbons and that's what I prefer to drink. 
Consider Cognac as well, if he doesn't have any.  My personal go-to for gifting is Courvoisier VSOP
Thanks so much for the detailed response! It's very helpful.

**General Tips**    
We generally advise novices to sample as much as possible by going to a bar, splitting bottles with friends, attending festivals/tastings or getting minis to ensure you buy bottles you enjoy. It may make more sense for you to focus on sampling rather than buy full bottles at the beginning of your journey.
Bourbon though, whisky is quite different.
OP wants a whisky.
All bourbon is Whiskey, All Whisk(e)y is not bourbon. There are Whiskys much closer to bourbon than Whiskey, and vice-versa. 
Aaaand someone isn‚Äôt clear on the concept. 
Except Maker's Mark.
Although yes, bourbon is in no way similar in taste to whisky. Let's say whisky is non corn based, while bourbon is corn based. Someone who asks for whisky probably wants whisky, while someone who asks for bourbon probably wants bourbon. There is no extra room for misinterpretation then. 

OP listed whisky, not bourbon, common sense would apply that they want whisky and not corn based bourbon whisky
OP specifically named whiskies, you listed bourbons. It's quite simple. 
Whisky is the umbrella term for a distilled grain mash, including corn. Now if you were to say *Irish* Whisky, that‚Äôs a different story. 


As far as etymology is concerned, the E tends to show up in colonies which rebelled against the crown, but this is in no way consistent.


You can‚Äôt say bourbon is in no way similar to Whisky, because it IS Whisky. 
Bourbon IS whisk(e)y. It is simple. 
If I said I want Coca Cola, would you recommend me Lemonade because technically they are both soft drinks? If someone wanted bourbon whisky, they would ask for bourbon. Anyway all good, I understand how you could have not read OP and just recommended your fav style of drink.

And sorry, but corn whisky is whisky, but it's called bourbon because it's corn based and tastes so different.
Look I could go deeper into your weird rabbit hole, but OP listed SCOTTISH whisky. You then recommend BOURBON whisky which is completely different in taste. 

Nice chatting with you.
And so does grain and barley. Dude I work at a place that serves ~210 varieties of whiskey from 7 countries. Even the IBA (International Bartender‚Äôs Association) uses Whisky/ey as the umbrella term.


I understand you associate the term with a specific mashbill/brand, but that‚Äôs inaccurate as far as 99% of beverage alcohol professionals are concerned. 
Op said her boyfriend tasted ‚Äúwhisky and scotch.‚Äù  That implies two different things. Reread the original post. 
I agree totally with you, OP listed Single Malt Scotch Whisky and Blended Scotch Whisky as examples, you then list American Whiskey. I mean umbrella term this and IBA that and you serve whisky - who cares, literally common sense would have dictated you either ask if they would consider bourbon, or you list scotch whisky. I am not arguing in any way that bourbon is not whisky, rather the preferred name that normal people call it when they might ask for some at a bar, or want to buy some online or at a store, they will ask for american whisky or bourbon, not just say ""i want some whisky please""
So why didn't you reply with Irish whisky? Also OP listed ""Johnnie Walker Black Label 12 and also mentioned Glenfiddich and Glenlivet? However I've read very mediocre reviews about them on here.""
And I as a long timer in the industry I refute your claim. And to use your analogy, you‚Äôre telling me Pepsi isn‚Äôt a cola. 

Ok, this will be my last reply. 


I made a recommendation for several whiskys (again, cola. You‚Äôre not the king of what‚Äôs Whisky.)  I picked several quality whiskys (again, everyone else but you.)  I think each of those would be enjoyed by most whisky lovers... that aren‚Äôt pedantic. 
Pepsi is a cola, but like I inferred, it tastes quite different!"
This is the most insane review of a Whisky I've ever read.,"So I live in Tampa and recently had the pleasure of trying a Compass Box Scotch created for Bern's which is a local restaurant with a heavy wine list.   I purchased a bottle after trying it, and i wanted to find a little more info so off to google I go.

""Compass Box Bern‚Äôs Steak House Limited Edition Blended Grain Whisky:

To say what I‚Äôd like to say about the compelling nose of this blend of five different 41 year-old casks of grain whisky from two different distilleries, I am reminded of the words used by the Masai when referring to Mt. Kilimanjaro: ‚ÄúNg√†je Ng√†i,‚Äù the House of God.  For there are oat scones used as hockey pucks on a sapphire rink.  Then I find fecund raisins begetting whole rows of vineyard grapes in a remarkable usurpation of pollen, bees, and the natural order of things.  Sure, there‚Äôs a brief lemon rind bitter note, like the one sung by a soprano jilted by her lover, the conductor.  But then the chorus surrounds her in deep, round, citric encouragement.  ‚ÄúWe got you, girl,‚Äù the growing crescendo seems to say, and the conductor‚Äôs arms, sweeping and assured at first, tighten into a contortion of contrition.  I shudder at the thought of bringing it to my lips.  Do I dare?

Our dear readers know very well that I do dare.  My report is this: the mouth is incredible.  Imagine the one day each year that Starburst executives take the controls from the manufacturers, and complete a day‚Äôs product run with a year‚Äôs worth of flavor crammed into the candies.  Willy Wonka himself would not have been able to tolerate the intensity of this.  There‚Äôs an orange-mango nectar that steps off the tram onto the platform three stops before ambrosia. Then a peppermint ragtime octet starts up a jaunty tune and the soundstage is well distributed with anise notes.  The tram leaves; the licorice fades to black; and I am made to consider what I shall call henceforth the ‚Äúbroducken‚Äù: a goldfish, swallowed through a beer bong funnel by a guy in a phone booth, who is himself surrounded by other guys until no more can be wedged in, and then the phone booth is crammed inside of a car filled with more bro-filled phone booths, and the whole, mess of young men is left like the strangest matryoshka doll on the university president‚Äôs lawn.  Such are the thoughts inside of thoughts that this whisky, with its tastes inside of tastes, inspires.

At first the finish is a little faster than expected.  But it redounds in wave like echoes in a strange geological formation.  It‚Äôs the hand-drawn work of a failed humanities professor who, in the dark night of the soul of her tenure review, turned her attention to the publication of topographical maps of fictional planets.  Valleys and peaks, buttes and marshes, drumlins and eskers‚Äîevery detail so lovingly rendered you feel that you could read it with your fingertips.  Willy Wonka‚Äôs retinue is perfectly dissipated; Willy himself is practically in repose; everyone is getting a golden ticket today.

I mean, it's a great whisky but...  ","Translation (I think):

Nose: oats, lots o' raisins, lemon peel.

Palate:  Candy sweetness, orange, and mango up front. Turns to mint and ainise. Young and hot (like so many sweaty guys in phone booths).

Finish: Short, kind of earthy

Overall: Great whisky. It made a strong impression on me, and I would certainly try again if given the opportunity.
So ridiculous I'm not even sure what it would taste like.  Not every flavor is a metaphorical scene.

"Looking for a memorable drink to share with friends and family, possibly for the last time.","To make a long story short, I will be going around to see friends and family and saying goodbye to them, possibly for the last time.  I want to make it memorable with a shared drink and I thought that whisky would be a great choice to do so.

The only problem is, I have very little experience with whisky outside of the (very) occasional Glenlivet 12 or Jameson.  Can anyone recommend a brand or bottle that would be memorable in a meaningful way?  My price point is $700 and below and I was initially thinking Glenmorangie Grand Vintage 1990 due to the flavor note description on it.

I personally find the Glenlivet 12 to be a bit strong in terms of how much it tastes like alcohol once it hits my mouth and don't know if higher end scotch will do that as well. 

Any and all advice and recommendations will be very appreciated, thanks for your time!

**Edit: I do not intend in any way to end my life and am not contemplating suicide.  For those that may be and need help here are two numbers for someone to talk with:

Do you like sweet or smoky? 
As long as the company is great, any drink would be suitable I find. Sorry for your situation, hope the best! 
Proof66.com

Maybe this will help
Honestly the difference between the top end whisky and the 100-200 bottles will be minimal for those who don't really drink whisky regularly. You mention Glenlivet 12 was rather Smokey- in reality it's very mild on a peat front. I reccomend an 18 yr old Highland Park. Neutral flavours but smooth as you like - also save you some $$. I also would second all the notes that suggest you speak to someone if it's in your control, but recognise it maybe medical and you don't want to share the personal details with the world. 
Since taste is such a subjective thing, it is quite difficult to make recommendations with not much to go on, but there are hints in what you've said that would lead me to recommend something with quite a low ABV (less than 46%) matured for a long time (18+ years?) either entirely or partly in sherry casks. But there are many of those and I don't know what might be available to you for up to $700. Do you have a specialist shop where you could ask the staff?

To narrow it down and possibly make it more special, you might try looking for something distilled in a year that had particular importance to you (birth year, when you started work or some other significant event?). For all I know, the Glenmorangie 1990 might fit that for you and would be a perfectly good choice.
It doesn‚Äôt have to be that extraordinarily extravagant. When my best friend knew that his fight with cancer took a turn to the inevitable he had me get a bottle of Woodford Reserve Maple Wood Finish. Under $100 but unique enough to be fitting for the occasion.   Honestly we could have drank regular Jim Beam and it would have been the best drink of my life.

I just picked up a Balvenie 14 year Caribbean Cask that is fantastic, under $100 USD, and unique enough for a special occasion.
Macallan 25 Years Old seems like an obvious choice. 
Couldn't really do wrong with Johnnie Walker Blue Label, and $700 will get you a couple of bottles.

But my other picks are: 
Scotch: Macallan Oscuro; Balvenie 30 yr old; Talisker 30 yr old
Bourbon: Pappy 12 year (gonna have to go after market), william larue weller
Japanese: Yamazaki 18 year
It is jumping to conclusions but I do appreciate you reaching out regardless and have put those numbers in my post.  As the top post in this thread I ask that you also please contribute recommendations if you have any
personally more sweet but as I said my only real experience is with glenlivet and jameson.  I am assuming the glen 12 is pretty smoky and I would rather go a more mild direction
maybe my use of smokey was incorrect, I was referring to the alcohol taste that happens right after it coats your tongue.  Is this an all whiskey/scotch phenomenon or is that unique to 12 since it has younger kegs mixed in?
Good luck finding macallan 25 for $700 or less...
unfortunately at 1500 that's a bit out of my price range, any second runner ups you can think of?
Is it only recently that Japan got big into the scene?  I know that Jim and Makers were bought by Japanese companies but maybe it's just because I'm starting research now

I know whisky tastes are completely personal.. However recently at a whisky festival on Falkirk I tried a bottling of a 1989 Highland Park. I know it's not a popular choice ""normally"" but it's a Murray McDavid bottling from bourbon barrel and finished in desert wine cask. It's the most amazing thing Ive tasted and very unique. 
Lovely and sweet

I haven't even looked at it in 10+ years, but I suppose you are correct. 
Springbank 25 seems to be going for about $700. It doesn't have the cache of Macallan, but it's reputation and collectability are comparable. I've tasted so many old Springbanks that it is almost boring in a way because they are so reliably delicious. I haven't tried the new one, but I can vouch for the distillery's dedication to quality throughout the range. 
In a similar vein the Macallan Rare Cask was an excellent tasting at this years London Whisky Show, its a sherried whisky however.
Yeah. Jim Murray (a giant douche) decided that Japanese whisky is the best and prices went insane a few years back. Blanton's is also owned by a japanese company. 
May be fairly recent, but they make a high quality whiskey.
Seconded. Life has a lot to offer, but sometimes it's hidden in a mess of shit. If you're lost in that mess, talking to someone can clear a path. Just give it a try, please.

The 18 year is a great value at about $175
Makes me curious if the same is going to happen for American Rye, because that seems to be his new schtick...
> The 18 year is a great value at about $175

huh?
I‚Äôm not referring to The Macallan. Springbank 18 year is usually a little over $175, more in the $190-$200 range.  So yes, the 18 year is a good value if you enjoy Springbank, especially if you consider the price jump for the 25 year.
Thanks for the clarification. I still think using the phrase great value with a $200 bottle of whisky is strange. "
Trader Joe's 16 years single malt Fettercairm. Quite good.,,"Where the hell is Fettercairm? I mean, I know Fettercairn well enough... I can see it says the same in the photo so not bitching at op, but seriously... And that bottler isn't exactly well known in Scotland, I'm guessing they mainly do for export?

EDIT: From their site - ""Imagine if you will, being on the windswept beaches of Islay and turning your collar to the cool ocean breeze blowing off the North Sea."" The North sea is East of Scotland, Islay is off the West coast...
Thanks for sharing the photo and details!

Only 6,000 bottles?  I better rush.

I haven't had this one, but I'm generally not a fan of Alexander Murray bottles.  At least the price isn't bad.  Peanuts in scotch sounds horrible to me.

Recommend me Whisky - ideally japanese,"o/  
Straight up sorry for the terribly uncoordinated text.  
My experience with notable whisky is rather little, but I'd love to find some more.  
As of now, I've tried Glenmorangie original which I fairly liked, Hibiki Japanese Harmony which I absolutely loved and Laphroaig Select which makes me wish I could refund because it's terrible - smells like cheesy alcohol and tastes like water.  
After trying Hibiki, I really want to try some more japanese whisky but I don't know which to choose from - I'm thinking about Hibiki Harmony Master's Select and adding a 30-40‚Ç¨ bottle, but wouldn't know which one.  
Of course I don't mind going with something else than the Hibiki, so I'm open to suggestions. The Nikka whiskys have loads of good reviews, but I don't exactly like their bottle design.","/u/recommendation_bot

Nikka From the Barrel, and Nikka Miyagikyo are my current favourite Japanese whiskies. I think they are both great value for money.

**General Tips**    
We generally advise novices to sample as much as possible by going to a bar, splitting bottles with friends, attending festivals/tastings or getting minis to ensure you buy bottles you enjoy. It may make more sense for you to focus on sampling rather than buy full bottles at the beginning of your journey.

What can I do with my overly woody whisky?,"A friend of mine bought me a bottle of Hudson Baby Bourbon sometime last year.  It turned out to be the worst whiskey I've had by a mile.  It was overly woody and just tasted of sour, burnt food.  Reasonable chance I had a bad batch as I've not seen anyone's tasting notes on this whiskey mirror any of my own.  

I still have a half the bottle left and I was wondering what I could do with the remains?  I'd rather not just pour it down the drain.  What could I mix with something insanely woody for a good cocktail?

Cheers!","For my tastes, it's not just woody, it's also young.  So it's ruined at both ends of the spectrum.

You could mix it with good bourbon to ruin the good bourbon only a little.
[deleted]
cook with, give away, bin.
My go to with Whiskey I don't like is to make cordial. Add a bunch if fruit to it in a mason jar. Let it sit 3 months. Pour it into a bowl with a bit of honey to taste. Mash it with a potato masher. Pour back in jar and let sit another month. Sieve it through a coffee filter back into the bottle. Serve in small amounts as a dessert.
Hold onto it for when your fatuous friend comes over.
Ginger beer or soda is the best call. Ginger is a natural palate cleanser and will take a lot of the burn out when the Whiskey travels down the esophagus‚Äã. Or you could find a friend that enjoys bourbon straight and ask them to trade you for a bottle of something more suitable to your preferences. 
> Reasonable chance I had a bad batch as I've not seen anyone's tasting notes on this whiskey mirror any of my own

i don't think you've been reading the same reviews i have. sounds par for the course to me. it's one of the most consistently hated whiskeys on /r/bourbon.
wait 4 hours, then consult a doctor. 
Gambler's fallacy, man. Just cut your losses and drain pour it. Go get something drinkable like Russell's Reserve Single Barrel.
A nice mint julep can rescue a substandard bourbon I find
Dump it and pick yourself up a WHEATER
If it stays overly woody for more than four hours you should consult a doctor.
run it through a britta filter a bunch of times and turn it into vodka.
Whiskey lemonade. Great in summer
I'm sure you can figure it out on your own.
Nice ginger-y ginger ale will make it palatable.

Try Mojitos with whiskey as the main.   

Shoot, any mixed drink.
This sounds like a cool idea, thank you!
Ah, I've only looked at reviews for this off of reddit actually
Drink two shots, and call you in the morning?

What's the big deal about Yamazaki 12?,"I read about the Yamazaki 12 being a great whisky to drink. Overall highly positive reviews left, right and centre. So I decided to buy a bottle, as well as a few tiny 50ml ones while I was in Japan. I opened a small one up and all I got from the nose was strong ethanol. It stung my nose. I waited about 10 minutes after pouring it into my glencairn and it was still so strong. I was sharing with my friend and he agreed. The taste was unspectacular and incredibly spicy. I had tasted the regular Yamazaki and it was OK, but this... the 12 was so strong it was almost horrible. I bought them from an alcohol store, so it couldn't have been bootleg. Am I missing something here?","Whiskyaboos will come out in full force to explain you had and off bottle, or, your palate isn't refined or mature enough.  You have to drink it at the right time of day, with the correct sunlight, and facing Japan, otherwise of course it's going to taste like run of the mill, middle to low end scotch that costs 33% more than it's UK counterparts.

I'm no whiskyaboo.

Japanese whisky is (by and large) incredibly unremarkable.  Yawnazaki included.  You are paying a premium for Scotch Jr. or Scotch Light.  Everything from Japan has a cheaper and better Scottish counterpart.

It's popular because it's rare and 'exotic.'  It is very approachable as well flavor-wise, so it's popular with newer whisky drinkers.

Of the 30 or so offerings I have had from Japan, none are worth recommending for the effort or cost to get.

No one needs to tell me 'how great J-Whisky used to be 30 years ago.'  I don't care. It doesn't exist so it doesn't matter.  The modern shelves are littered with forgettableness.  


youre not missing anything.  maybe I should summon /u/rustypipes  and /u/t8ke 
I'm going to offer a different perspective here. When Yamazaki 12 was 6000 yen a bottle, it was a go-to for me. I love it for a number of reasons but now since the massive price jump two years ago (over 9000 yen a bottle), I don't touch it. 

Yamazaki has a lovely characteristic. It's very engineered to be that way, as most Japanese whiskies are. But the lovely vanilla oak and spice are, in my opinion, quite excellent. Is it worth nearly the $100 price tag? Nope, not at all. The boom in whiskies and Japanese whiskies in particular has made Yamazaki a must try for a lot of people for better or worse and there's no question that Suntory are trying to capitalize on the the boom as much as possible. So there's a lot of hype to wade through. As usual, it comes down to the drinker and the profile they enjoy. 

I love Yamazaki 12... I just don't like the price tag. 
It has good marketing. 
I enjoyed it 10 years ago, but as I have learned, blends change over time. If there is a huge increase in demand for a certain blend, then it will almost always change for the worst. 
The best comparison I've come up with for Japanese whiskey is Olympic diving. When you watch Japanese divers in the Olympics, they are technically perfect but so refined they are boring to watch. Most Japanese whiskies feel the same way to me--technically perfect but boring.

I've tried ~30 Japanese whiskies, including various single barrels and cask strength offerings, and I haven't been highly impressed by any of them for the price. Yamazaki 12 wasn't worth it when it was $60/bottle, and the current prices are obscene. And I always preferred the 12 to the 18 (though in Scotch, I usually prefer the older expressions).

My all time favorite Japanese whiskey (for value) was the Hibiki 12 when it was $40-$50 a bottle just 3 years ago. At the time, it was one of my go to whiskeys -- light and easy sipping with a beautiful honeysuckle finish, and the best beautiful bottle and high approachability made it the best gift whiskey on the market. Now, at $150 a bottle, I'll never own a bottle again.

I believe Japan has the potential to do what Ireland is doing, entering a new wave of whiskey with more experimentation and more interest, but I haven't seen it yet. If people know of any counter-examples of great stuff coming out of Japan, I'd love to know about them. I'm willing to give it another chance.
> Overall highly positive reviews left, right and centre.

As others have said, those reviews don't reflect my opinion.
This might be a generalization, but Japanese whisky seems specifically blended to round off any edges and make sure that no one single aspect dominates. So if you're the type of person looking for a ""smooth"" whisky, it might be your thing. I personally prefer Scotch because the rough edges and specific flavor profiles give the whisky more character. The one thing I do like about Japanese whisky is how picky they are about cask selection...something that certain distilleries in Scotland might learn from.
Coming from a 28 year old's tongue / palate, the first time I tried Yamazaki 12 two years ago, I thought that it was amazing on how they can make a 12 year whisky taste much more mature than it was. It was very smooth and dangerously easy to drink, especially on a single rock. I didn't get any alcohol harshness or burn. I haven't tried everything, and I also now know that older =/= better, but with me beginning my whisky journey, it appeared that way to me.
> The modern shelves are littered with forgettableness.

This is true of all whisky, not just asian whisky. 
Thanks for the insight into Japanese whisky in general. Could you explain some possible reasons why yamazaki normal is fine, but the 12 is so acrid? 
""and facing Japan"" This killed me XD
This is still funny 4 years later
He replied so I didn't have to. All hail /u/rustypipes 
+1. For 6000 yen a bottle, I'd go for a bottle of Suntory Royal or the Hibiki Harmony.
#WHISKEY BIBLE CIRCLE JERK
Usually it's easiest to blame something eaten or smoked prior to sampling.  Or those notes I can sometimes get drinking whiskey first, and not warming up with 3-4 oz of vodka on the rocks.

This is more of a long shot, 50ml are more susceptible to environmental changes I'm sure, but I don't have much info to support that.  You said you bought a couple? Have you tried the other one?
Suntory royal should only cost you about 2000 yen unless I'm mistaken so you could pick up a few of those for one yamazaki. And I guess that's kind of the point. Yama-Chan is just over priced. 
Pretty much."
George Dickel Barrel Select was a pleasant surprise.,"I picked up a bottle for $40 on a whim. I haven't particularly liked other George Dickel branded whiskies, so I was surprised by how much I've enjoyed [this one](http://www.drinkspirits.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_8476.jpg).

I'm not great at tasting notes, but even at 86 proof it drinks smooth, with flavors of apple, vanilla, caramel and a bit of tobacco to give it balance. No smoke. It's a touch sweet, but doesn't have a syrupy mouth feel the way some bourbons can have. It's not very complex, but it is very pleasant.

I think it's a new favorite for the price. I like it as much as Woodford.","there are 9 year old and 14 year old variants of these that come in at 103 proof. i've really enjoyed some of those.

you'll get more discussion about dickel over on /r/bourbon which is for all american whiskeys.

https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/search?q=dickel+review&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all
Have you tried Dickel No. 12?
Not yet. You recommend it though?
Just got a bottle of the Dickel No. 12. 

It's fine for a $20 whiskey, but is not nearly as good as the Barrel Select, which should probably be expected since it's half the price.

The Barrel Select is smoother and has far more flavor.

I don't think the No. 12 will surplant Old Grand Dad Bonded as my go-to $20 bottle. Thanks for the recommendation though!
I prefer the No. 12 slightly, but it depends on what you like about Dickel.  

No. 12 is definitely younger but not as over-oaked as Barrel Select can be, IMO.
I disagree that price and ""goodness"" are always correlated, but taste is subjective.

Glad you tried it.  At least you have your opinion about it now.  Cheers!
> I disagree that price and ""goodness"" are always correlated

That's not what I'm trying to say. They're not *always* correlated. I've definitely had some 35-40 buck whiskeys I like less than the No. 12, especially because I value flavor more than smoothness. Just frequently there is a big difference in quality that goes along with price, especially when you're comparing whiskeys made by the same company.
Price is set by marketing and, to some extent, age.  Yes, Barrel Select is older and comes in a fancier bottle.  You could say the age justifies the increase in price, but I still find Barrel Select to be over-oaked (for *my* tastes).

> but is not nearly as good as the Barrel Select, which should probably be expected since it's half the price.

I'm just saying that I wouldn't necessarily ""expect"" price to indicate quality, which is what you said.

> Just frequently there is a big difference in quality that goes along with price, especially when you're comparing whiskeys made by the same company.

Until you go past the point of peak quality, at which point the correlation of price to quality falls apart, even within the same company.  There are numerous examples of this.  Another would be Redbreast 15yr.  (Again, only accounting for *my* subjective tastes).

It's driven more by marketing and product differentiation than anything else."
Toronto Whisky Society launched by group of redditors from the GTA - check it out and join us!,"hey everybody, 

a group of us from the GTA decided to create an online presence apart from Reddit, putting our reviews and events on a website, plus twitter/instagram etc. It then ballooned into a decision to create a full on whisky group that would run events and interact with the larger whisky community. We're looking to get a few more members from the GTA to join us. Currently we have 14 members and are looking to max out at 24 to keep events at a manageable size. 

Please [check out our website](http://www.torontowhiskysociety.ca) to which we are currently moving all of the content our charter members have created here on Reddit, [engage with us on our twitter](https://twitter.com/TorontoWhisky), our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/torontowhiskysociety/), and follow us on [our Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/torontowhisky/). 

If you're interested in joining, there will be a nominal $10 membership fee for 2017 which helps us cover the costs of the website, domain and other start-up costs. The benefits of membership will be invitations to exclusive events, of which we hope to have 6 next year and which will include: 

* Private distillery tours and tastings to Canadian distilleries, big and small. [Here's a link to a past event we had with Toronto Distillery Co](https://torontowhiskysociety.wordpress.com/2016/10/27/toronto-whisky-society-visits-the-toronto-distillery-co/) and another where [Devoz visited the Wiser's facility in Windsor and got to taste Union 52](https://torontowhiskysociety.wordpress.com/2016/11/14/toronto-whisky-society-wisers-distillery-tour-union-52-review/)

* Private tastings with brand ambassadors from scotch and world whisky distilleries (we have a few of these in the works already)

* private in-home tastings [like the one we had last month](https://torontowhiskysociety.wordpress.com/2016/11/07/toronto-whisky-society-drinks-whisky-gets-drunk/) or the [high proof bourbon night we had in march](https://torontowhiskysociety.wordpress.com/2016/03/05/toronto-whisky-society-high-proof-bourbon-tasting-night/)

* Feather's and other whisky pub nights with custom flights, [like the one we did a couple years ago](https://torontowhiskysociety.wordpress.com/2015/02/28/toronto-whisky-societys-inaugural-feathers-night/)

We're very excited about this group and hope you'll message us through our website form to join us!

"Introducing myself and my whisky reviews, photos, videos, etc.","Hi everyone, I wanted to introduce myself and my collection of whisky related content. I've been appreciating whisky for about the last 10 years and recently decided to chronicle the stuff I get to taste. I put together a bunch of social profiles under the brand name FlaskFriday, including an Instagram profile for my /r/whiskyporn shots, a YouTube channel for tastings and reviews we shoot in my office, and Twitter and Facebook accounts for, honestly I'm not sure why, other than to cover the social spectrum and open up interaction and sharing options. 

&nbsp;

I'm personally a big fan of Japanese and traditional scotch whiskies and often get into interesting bottles of other stuff. I plan to use this Reddit account primarily to contribute to and communicate with the many existing whisky subs and I may post some of our original content if its good enough and isn't spammy. 

&nbsp;

To be fully transparent, we aren't currently sponsored by or affiliated with any whisky or alcohol brands. However, if that changes I will definitely post about it because that would be awesome. 

&nbsp;

I'm open to suggestions about pretty much anything‚Äîimproving our videos, what to review, being a good Reddit citizen, etc.

&nbsp;

Thank you & Sl√°inte!","> we aren't currently sponsored by or affiliated with any whisky or alcohol brands. However, if that changes I will definitely post about it because that would be awesome.

Who is ""we""?

Sorry, but the fact that you're already actively seeking industry sponsorship makes your opinions suspect.
One other unrelated thing, I can help with any CSS work if any of the whisky subs need help. I'm guessing there probably enough front-end devs on Reddit but that's my day job and I'm happy to help if anyone needs it.
We is, there are actually a few people who are contributing content to FlaskFriday. A friend of mine who now lives in SF also does videos with his friends that we're going to try and get on to the YouTube channel. There is another friend I work with who writes for a whisky blog who is really knowledgable. And another guy I work with who is big on learning about bourbon now who is contributing a bit of knowledge to the group. 

The only thing I can say about having suspect opinions is hopefully my actual contributions will disprove any bias. Thank you for the heads up though. I didn't realize anyone would be skeptical so quickly. 
Thanks for your response!  I'll try to check it out sometime.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of bloggers who get into this just for the free samples and industry access, and there are plenty of marketing companies willing to take advantage of that situation.

These days, the question you should ask yourself is what do you provide that other whisky bloggers don't already.  Perhaps it's just for your own enjoyment, which is fine, but see here for a great discussion about it, including the issue of industry sponsorship:

http://myannoyingopinions.com/2013/10/23/annoying-whisky-bloggers/
Just so you know before you proceed, the Whisky Network does not allow video reviews or offsite blog reviews. If you intend to review anything, make sure your reviews are posted in full on reddit and not simply a link to your offsite blog or YouTube channel. Check out how /u/thewhiskeyjug formats their posts when they post here.
I'll totally check out the link. Thank you. Mainly I think documenting my experience and engaging with other passionate drinkers will enrich my personal experience. I.e., personal enjoyment. 
Just got through the article and honestly about halfway through my eyes are glazed over. I don't know who these people are or what an industry insider is. I'm a guy who likes whisky and posts videos of my friends and I drinking it at my office. I feel like I should be honored to be confused with a proper whisky blogger except that based on that article, whisky bloggers sound like biased douchebags - which I don't feel like I am. 

&nbsp;

I'm super curious if you have any thoughts about our videos (aside from the poor audio quality and the rambling...)
I noticed how others were doing it and wondered about the format so thank you for making it clear!
The point of the article is that if you would accept free samples, one-on-one interaction with a master distiller, and/or a free trip to Kentucky or Scotland, there's the possibility that your opinion could be bought.  So as soon as the marketers decide you have a large enough audience worth buying, they may approach you.  And if your stated goal is that you would love them to sponsor you, then you already might be avoiding publishing honest opinions that may offend any of your potential future sponsors (since there are only about 10 liquor companies in the world).

I'm not saying that's true, but it raises the question.

Yeah, I couldn't get much out of your videos.  I watched the Col. Taylor one, couldn't hear much, one of your friends called it ""smooth"" (a meaningless word that you'll see many dislike), and I turned it off when you started discussing your co-workers.  Seems like you're having fun, but I'm not sure why it was being videotaped.

All the best luck in your adventures!  Perhaps we'll interact on Reddit.  I'm a bit advanced for your videos, but I hope others will enjoy!
I get your point about sponsorship and completely agree that it could be a cause for suspicion. I don't feel like having that aspiration currently affects my choice of what to drink and recommend. In fact if I ever did have any kind of affiliation I feel like it would have to allow me to still post whatever content and recommendations I wanted. 

Also, thank you for the feedback on the video. My idea was just to put something out there rather than try and make it perfect first. Not totally sure there's a point to the videos yet other than to hopefully figure out an interesting format. We did get a better mic so the ones after the bourbon should be better. In any case I'm wide open to more suggestions. Also open to having anyone in NYC come drink with me and chat!
Cool, well it's all about having fun, so enjoy!  Even if no one watches, it can be educational to put your thoughts into words.
Thank you!"
Wheat Toast w/ Jam! : the results.,"a big howdy to the WhiskyNetwork, Texacer here with a small project 4 months in the making.

1. [1 month in, Wheat Toast needs some Jam](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/3qgh5q/1_month_in_wheat_toast/)

tl;dr- I blended Weller 107 and Laphroaig 10 cask strength, then added some DrySack Sherry 15 to created a vatted blend.  I originally thought the wheated profile would match the Laphroaig nicely but it really didn't.  So then the experiment switched to see if you could just add sherry to a whisky to make something good, instead of maturing in ex-sherry or seasoned sherry barrels.  Results were decent in the end, it tastes drinkable and not the worst thing I've ever had in my mouth. 

---

After that month, I just kind of left it.  I did an experiment with Glenmorangie Original where I added some sherry directly to the bottle and I think turned out better than La Santa.  I added too much sherry to the wheat toast I think but it did take the edge off the crappy dirty taste and smoke, so mission was accomplished.  

What to do next?  I waited a while and then enlisted 3 reviewers from /r/sampleswap hoping enough time had passed that they wouldn't remember my project.  All I said was the whisky was rare, which it is!  The ONLY bottle in the world like it.

all three, while super created and fun to read did an excellent job reviewing my sample.  I am very pleased with the results.  It got decent scores.  I couldn't just post with my word only.  I invite these three to offer any finishing remarks below.  

I now have a bottle of Port that I'm going to experiment with, but I believe I was successful in proving what I wanted in the end.  You can add sherry to your whisky for a decent result and yes it does feel like cheating.  Just don't add too much and blends may vary but also change over time.  Adding a little sherry to a shit whisky might save it, just like people like to add small staves.  

I hope you enjoyed this little experiment.  

cheers","What were the final ratios?
I added some PX sherry to Bruichladdich X4+1 just for the hell of it - it turned out surprisingly drinkable, but I think you are right about ""Just don't add too much""!

I have enjoyed reading about your more elaborate experiment.
So what you're saying is that this is literally the rarest alcohol in the world, rarer than pappy 23 and stagg put together?

Will you accept $5000 for it?
Interesting - I have 3 blends that have been sitting for 5 months and a couple weeks, am planning to check up on them in a week or two!
What's the deal with /r/sampleswap anyway? I hear it's a good subreddit, but requires a number of perverse and humiliating hazing rituals to get in. 
How long do you think blends need to be vatted for them to marry?
I don't know about /u/Ethanized or /u/Dramonaut, however my feeling was that it needed more Laphroaig and less sherry.

I'd stick to no more than 1% Sherry, and maybe less for stronger ones. 
Those blends people throw together are funny. 

I had an infinity bourbon blend that I gave up on but had a whole slew of random shit thrown into from bottom shelf to Stagg. Some of my girlfriends friends had a go at it because I left it out on the counter before hand as I was moving some bottles.

They all said it was amazing. I was like whu? Granted, they weren't connoisseurs like us but that stuff wasn't just watered down 80 proof noob juice. It just had been sitting pretty for a year and half is all, completely forgotten.

Funny how those blends work. 
probably 75% weller, 15% Laphroaig and 15% sherry.  I know thats over 100 but I drank out of it before adding sherry.  
That's... that's hardcore. Isn't X4+1 hard to get? And if not, can you hook me up?
cash only!
what blends?
have you seen Caligula? 
month is probably best. 
I have just started tasting sherries on their own. Wondering if PX vs. Oloroso vs. Fino would need variations on the sherry ratio. PX seems the strongest to me so far.
Yeah, I'd definitely not exceed 5%, but if working with Cask strength whiskeys I think going up to that may be reasonable. All depends on how potent the Sherry is, really!
I obviously have lower standards than you and /u/Ethanized as I scored it highest. I could use more frog in it. And I would agree that I'd stay with under 5%. Most of what I read was that it should be in or below that range. But now having read /u/texacer historical threads, I think he did a great job on recovering the lost bottle. 
Hmm... either that was a good sherry or the blend actually worked well - this was FAR more drinkable than Dark Batch - which tastes like cough syrup to me.
I got mine in an auction - when I saw [it said ""Deliverance"" on the label](https://www.whisky-onlineauctions.com/bruichladdich-x4-lot-id-606.html), I couldn't resist...
Local pick up only.
- 50/50 Maker's and Alberta Rye Dark Batch

- 75/25 Knob Creek Small Batch and JW Black

- 25/25/25/25 SAOS 10yr, Eagle Rare, Makers 46, OGD BiB

Mostly for shits and giggles and done in *very* small batches
My dog's name is Caligula!
I've only had an Oloroso with Tapas, and it was strong as well. I have a Port or Sherry taster pack waiting for me to crack into.. some day.
I would've loved to taste the iterations (time and blend based)...
it was a good sherry.  15 year old. 
And you poured sherry into the bottle?
any reasoning behind those specific combos or was it more of a ""hell let's throw these together and see what happens!""?
I'd liken it more to Saw...
So. Much. To. Taste. 
What's the cost for that bottle?
No, I'm not that reckless! I only mixed enough for a large glassful. (Though a little of the X4+1 came in handy when I wanted to disinfect a cut on my ankle...)
The first two were somewhat calculated, makers was bland and Alberta was too fruity so I thought they'd blend well, same with the astringency of the Knob and the light smoke of the JW but the last was a yolo fuck it blend

"texacer's sample of mystery, or how I went to poison control, review","Pulled a lot of muscles in my stomach the other day. Then baked three different things, sat down with this dram, and manned it out.

Cause I'm manly as fuck. Or at least that's what my mom says.

Awhile ago /u/texacer asked for some people to try a liquid. Being the trusting sort that I was, and in the mood for something vaguely alcoholic and from someone I've never met yet trusted to put things in my body before (we'll always have Paris [Ontario] /u/texacer), I ponied up to punch myself in the face.

This is that dram. He asked that it be reviewed here at /r/whisky. I'm the third and last person to review it. You're all caught up now.

So let's see how this tastes, shall we?

* * *

[Image cause you like pictures](http://i.imgur.com/GebyCFM.jpg)

**Price:** No idea.

**Region:** I have no clue

**Abv:** I think there's alcohol in there, yes

**Colour:** 2.5YR 2/8

**Nose:** Brown sugar, cranberry, cherry, grapefruit, oak, pastry, cloves, smoke

Both my wife and I tried this, and we both thought we had it before. But it had a different smell than /u/texacer's semen, so we ruled that out.

There's a little bit of smoke at the end that reminds me of something. Also quite fruity. I'd guess this was sherried. Or is sherry. Or the antidote is sherry. One of the above.

**Taste:** Cherry, butter, salt, pepper, raisin, mint, stewed sweet potato, toast

The body is all over the place, like a suicide bomber right as he figures out that 72 figs was not worth it. I'm doubling down on the sherry part, it's very evident.

Also some aspects of a virgin cask. I don't like the earthier/sweet parts at the end. Throws it off a little too much. It's lighter than I'd prefer.

**Finish:** Cherry, currant, maple, orange rind, pepper, grape

Maybe too much sherry. Maybe. Just a tad. It's taking over. This could be sherry for all I know. I've had maybe 2 other Sherries. I knew a girl named Sherrie. That doesn't help in this case.

There's grape, is what I'm saying. Not as bad as the Grape Ape, but grape is the main thing. I want more whisky. If this is whisky. Or maybe I just feel like whisky. Or assume this is whisky because we're on /r/whisky.

**Conclusion:** So I think I figured out what this was, however I'll leave that to the guess section. My wife helped, what with her spit opening up the whisky, as she does with all booze I drink.

There's something going on here that's an odd, fun combination of things. That said, they need to be balanced more. The nose sells us on a mixture of flavours that should meld together to make cherry pie (the good kind, not that time of the month kind).

The taste then kinda delivers, though the amount of earth and red fruit/sherry elements turn down for what, I don't know.

The finish is dominated by the sherry, and that's where you lose me. Needs more cowbell, or at least, something whisky-esque in it.

So, while I enjoy the nose, have mixed feeling about the taste, and generally feel bamboozled by the finish, I could still drink this.

**79/100**

**My Guess:** This is /u/texacer's mixture of Laphroaig, Weller, and Sherry.","Needs further vatting?
thanks to tvraisedme for spoiling it in the last thread!

but yeah, it was my vatted :)

for those that don't know, 79/100 from TOModera is actually a decent score from him, so I'm pleased.  

I'll do my writeup now and xpost my thoughts to the network
Given the reveal, ""the antidote is sherry"" seems very perceptive indeed!
Maybe? Or less sherry? I know Alberta Premium does only .5% of sherry, so that could be the issue, as I believe Tex did 20%
Cool, good to know.

In all honesty, I didn't see /u/tvraisedme's comment. I just guessed this.
oh. sorry bro. was just guessing. 
wanna buy the rest off me?  $10,000 for the only bottle in existence. 
just goofin, it turned out exactly how I wanted in the end.  
Nah. While I liked it, I feel that it needs less Sherry and more Laphroaig. 
good!
Jim Murray gave it a 11/10
That low from Jimbo? Hope you don't take it personally
at least you rated this blend higher than Crown Royal Rye"
Your mom was giving me the best Texacer last night. #RandomWhisky Review,"\#RandomWhisky arrives. An address posted, unfamiliar name. No letter, no private message on reddit. Had the Whisky Fairy deemed the favors forever in my odds. 

Who am I to turn down free whisky? Wait, is it even whisky? 

/me removes tape, untwist cap. Deeply inhale.

Smells like aged rum. Quick! Did you drunken_self order sober_self a gift...again? Maybe but sober_self never complained before. I cap the sample and set it on the desk. Got plans tonight, checking out the new hype bar with the boys. Will have to return to this mystery later.

One evening later in the not so distant future, a [wild message](http://imgur.com/8xeJ9DE) appears. 

Drunk_me has failed me yet again. But /u/texacer delivers. 

Do you know what a Texacer is? [You're welcome.](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Texacer)





I do not usually add a color entry into my reviews. E150a (caramel) [coloring is added for consistency] (https://www.masterofmalt.com/blog/post/can-you-taste-caramel-%28e150a%29-in-whisky.aspx) and does not affect the taste. 

Today's pour is of a tawny shade. That's dark copper for your homosexuals. 

The legs, I usually just split em down the middle. *ahem* But today I watch them. Second round of legs are thick and slow from the rim. 

Upon first receiving this random and unbeknownst dram, it smelled like a rum and whisky blend. Having let it settle from its long cross-continental and oceanic voyage, its ready to give more; **saunternes, marzipan, demerara sugar, tobacco leaves, lavender flowers, stewed apples, dried apricots.**

It's definitely a sherried scotch but with perhaps a wine cask finish. Bordering on too sweet and winey. Guessing its not cask strength; it's hitting above 40% but below 50%. I'm aiming at a 43%-46%. I could be wrong. 

Delving into the dragon's den reveals: **toffee, fig, smoke, coffee grounds*. All that fruit takes a backseat to a heavy char influence. *Oily, smokey, coastal influence; sea-shell, dried shellfish.** 

The giant sleeps but tucks himself away with: **leather, almonds, orange peel, white pepper, cocoa.**


The more I drink it, the more I like it. I discriminated against it because well, it wasn't a cask strength. But it's full of flavor. 

My guess? Highland/Speyside with a maderia/olorosso cask finish. Excuse my inexperience but the closest I've had would be a Abundah. 

Score: **88.5**/100

> 95-100 A classic! All components are balanced appropriately, with the complexity and character expected in a classic.

> 90-94 Outstanding! One of the best for its style. Distinctive.

> 80-89 Good to very good. Plenty of character and no identifiable flaws. Worth seeking out.

> 70-79 Average. No unique qualities. Flaws possible.

> 60-69 Below average. Major flaws. Avoid.","this was entertaining :)

I put that entry into urbandictionary 
those other people need to hurry up so we can see what this is.
Well written, much gusto, very sherry.

Can't say I picked out much shellfish or any sea-side notes on first look, but I agree with the old sherried Highlands guess.
It sounds like ole Tex has been experimenting with a Dark Horse style blend of whisky and wine.

**Mystery Review ‚Äì Well Insulated Mystery Sample from /u/texacer**,"*First and foremost, thank you to /u/texacer for posting a request for a couple of guinea pigs‚Ä¶ err, I mean reviewers for the tasting of a mystery dram. Also, thanks to /u/dustlesswalnut for pointing tex in my direction ‚Äì I have a feeling I‚Äôm going to owe you both one, so be prepared to drink some Hirsch20.*

*With that nonsense out of the way, let‚Äôs get this review started. Tex mentioned the pour was a sweeter one, so I‚Äôm going in a little skeptical. I‚Äôve found that a sweet palate and dry finish is what hits the spot for me, so hopefully this one doesn‚Äôt disappoint. It‚Äôs been a busy day, so I‚Äôm looking forward to winding down with a nice pour of whiskey.*

&nbsp;

* **Setup:** 1oz in Glencairn, rested 20 min.
* **Color:** [Mahogany. Thin, slow-moving legs and an outline that hangs around the glass like it was glued on.](http://i.imgur.com/uHLkdHa.jpg)
* **Nose:** First impression was scotch: a highland if I had to guess. After some time, a bit more character comes through. Second impression is it‚Äôs a sherried dram. There‚Äôs no heat on the nose, even if I stick my whole schnozz into the glencairn. I‚Äôm not picking up any peat, just a nutty kind of fruit profile: some pralines, stewed apples, and candied fruits
* **Palate:** Wow ‚Äì this thing is a mouthful. Instead of getting hit with proof, you get lambasted with a ton of oily heft, like low-sweetness maple syrup. There‚Äôs a shit-ton of flavor here, candied raisins, figs, vanilla. It‚Äôs very sweet, but more of a front-palate-tip-of-the-tongue sweetness than a cloying back of the throat sweetness. Like a well-aged port.
* **Finish:** Just a tiny touch of warmth lingers, but the rich fruity sweetness and fruit flavors hang on for some time. I would peg this as an older port or madeira instead of a scotch if I didn‚Äôt know any better.
* **Score:** 86/100 
* **Value:** ???

&nbsp;

So I think Tex got drunk and bottled some 30yr Taylor Fladgate instead of a whiskey‚Ä¶ this thing drinks like a port more than any whiskey I think I‚Äôve tasted to date. It does remind me a bit of the Black Art (3, I think) I had a few months ago. There are tons and tons of fruit flavors, a very heavy body, and not a hint of proof burn. So what‚Äôs the problem? Well, there‚Äôs no oak (or other hearty flavors) to balance out the sweetness. The dram ends up being a very good digestif or dessert replacement; it doesn‚Äôt lack complexity, but it does lack balance. If it‚Äôs readily available, I‚Äôd grab a bottle, but I wouldn‚Äôt camp out for it. Anyway, thanks for reading, and most importantly thanks to Tex and Dustless for giving me a chance at this review!

Advent Whisky Calendar Tastings (x-post from /r/whiskey),"I previously posted a picture of the whisky calendar I got for Christmas and a few users expressed interest in sharing impressions and tasting notes. So if you have the calendar or have tried the bottle before feel free to share your feedback!

Day 1 Glenfarclas 25y single malt, Speyside

 

APPEARANCE Pale gold, like honey Not much legs to it surprisingly, low viscosity

 

NOSE Sweet and spicy

 

PALATE A bit of sweetness and cereal, tangy citrus, finishes mellow and sweet like honey. A few drops of water opened up notes of oak and pepper.

 

IMPRESSIONS Nice sipping whisky, I didn't find it overly complex. Very smooth and not at all smoky or peaty. A good choice if you love Irish whiskey.
",This would get more love at /r/Scotch.
Sample Reviews vs Bottle Reviews,"I have seen quite a few blind sample reviews recently.  I really like the idea of reviewing something without knowing what it is.  I think it is a more ""intellectually honest"" way of going about evaluating a whiskey.  

The only problem I have is that Most of the tasting notes that I have done involve taking handwritten notes in a small notebook over the course of many drams from a bottle. Near the end of the bottle I sit down and go through all of those notes to compile my final tasting notes/review of the whiskey. In doing this I often find some is inconsistent notes from one review to another. In fact, there are even times where one whole page of notes from the specific dram seems completely different from the others. When that happens I typically removed that many review from any contribution to my final tasting note. I tend to think maybe I had even something that affected my palate was possibly sick and perhaps some aroma in the air or something just happened to make that tasting be off.

So while I like these point reviews and want to get involved in this somehow myself I sort of wonder how useful they actually are when you think about it being only one ""kick at the cat"" as compared to the multiple kicks you get from reviewing an entire bottle.

I Thought I'd throw it out there for others' thoughts and opinions on the topic.","There's no perfect way to review. It's messy. Blind reviews have their advantages because it removes some pre-conceived biases but, as you said, you're only reviewing one glass.

I have a sliding scale for review trust. Probably the most suspect review is the first pour off of a hyped bottle. I'll usually dismiss those entirely - way too much emotion going on there.
I use blind reviews to help improve my analytical abilities.  The score and the opinions just help me decide whether I would actually want a bottle.  It's possible that I'm too harsh on a pour or that the sample was tainted but I'm always willing to re-evaluate in the future.  Since my whisky dollars are limited I don't feel like I need to be charitable.  Impress me up front or move along.
This is something I struggle with myself and prefer to have a few sessions with a bottle before reviewing but that opportunity just doesn't always present itself. I want to review whiskey that isn't available for a number of reasons and therefore really plan out the circumstances of the tasting. I don't eat any spicy, oniony, or garlicy foods prior which is tough b/c I love all of those things. I make sure I'm in a good place mentally and distraction free. Then I just chill out on the couch and spend about an hour getting to know the juice in my glencairn. 

The flip side of this is sometimes I'll let a bottle get to far down to the bottom and worry about oxidation. Where is the sweet spot in a bottle - midway? I certainly don't review a bottle off the first dram and usually prefer to the give some time to breathe. 

Damned if you do and damned if you don't.
I generally review samples (blind or otherwise) without a score and only to get my impression and whether I would want to buy a bottle. 

I feel as though I can't properly assess a dram until I have had a few over the course of multiple nights.
I read that it had been suggested to one well-respected reviewer to write about how the Whiskey makes him feel rather than rely on numbers and sensory experience. I thought that would make for a hilarious guide: ""Sad, whimsical with a touch of envy""
I think of reviews as snapshot impressions, useful by themselves for capturing a specific experience with a pour and useful in aggregate to get a feel for how well liked the whisky is in general. I typically review a whisky based on only one or two ounces of it, but that's usually enough to give me a firm impression. 

While a review that combines numerous tastings over the lifetime of the bottle might provide a more accurate and well established opinion, it's still only the opinion of one person. 
As Vince Lombardi said, ""perfection is unattainable but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence.""

That's sort of what I'm looking for here. I totally agree with you about first pours of hyped bottles. There's that temptation to give it a stellar review because of the hype and to justify your investment in the bottle. And I suppose some very cynical people might say to increase the secondary market value.


so I suppose the best review would be of a blind bottle haha. Really inconvenient"
1 month in: Wheat Toast,"about a month ago I started a home blend of Old Weller Antique and Laphroaig Cask Strength.  

I love those two whiskies and very unscientifically mixed some together in an old Rock Hill Farms decanter.  80% Weller to 20% Laphroaig, give or take an error margin of -+20%....

It sounded good.  It didn't taste good.  In fact as last noted it turned rather dirty and reminded me of Bowmore.  yuck.

1 month in, what I've named Wheat Toast, felt like a failure.

So what do?!

I decided to do this - http://imgur.com/cBiOpvk.jpg

I got to thinking, what really is the difference between using a sherry seasoned cask and just dumping some sherry into a barrel with whisky?

So I bought this Dry Sack, Oloroso Sherry, from Jerez Spain made with Pedro Ximenez grapes.  

This stuff smells and tastes like Macallan Cask Strength, because it is what Macallan had been using actually.  Or so the label says. 

So now I've created Sherried Wheat Toast. 

And so far, it aint bad.  The sherry has tamed the smoke and it doesnt taste dirty anymore.  I'll probably add a little more and wait another month.

In the mean time, I may make some other Sherried Whiskies since I have a big bottle of it anyway!  It is a fortified wine at 20% abv, so it'll last a bit.  Hmmm, what should I sherry next?","> I got to thinking, what really is the difference between using a sherry seasoned cask and just dumping some sherry into a barrel with whisky?

It's what the Canadians do all the time...
Just curious, how much have you added? 
So, wasn't the last one called Wheat Toast because:

OWA=Wheat

Laphroaig=Toast(ed your wheat)

So does this have anything peated in it? Or is it just the Rock Hill that is your wheat/bread? So this is basically Bread & Jelly? Bread & Jam?


Awesome idea!  I added some PX sherry to a mac 12 and put the mix into a mini barrel, didn't work out too well.  Sick home bar!
I assume its a law thing, why they don't just do it in Scotland.  We'll see how well they meld together.  btw I sent off your parkers yesterday. 
about a tenth of volume.  
It's the same blend but with sherry now.
> I assume its a law thing, why they don't just do it in Scotland.

Yeah.  Canadians are allowed up to 9.09% of something else (including wine).  I believe scotch isn't allowed any ""added"" wine, but is allowed a carryover of 1-2%--essentially just whatever remains in a wine barrel before filling it with distillate.
So Rock Hill Farms for is just there to pat the sherry on the back and let it know everything will be okay? 

So I'm curious, did you make a new blend or just add the sherry to the already vatted blend? Guessing the latter. How long has the sherry been in? day or two?

Also, was this like doubling down on the original idea or just Hail Mary way to save the whisky from being a drain pour?

If it works out I'm hoping the name can be something like Wheat Toast & Jam.
Only on exported products. Stuff intended for canadian consumption can be 99% something else if it follows the 3yr age and has the right character. Our whisky laws are stupid.
zero actual rock hills in the blend.  I just used the empty bottle to blend.  This is the exact same blend as before, I just dumped sherry into it now.  been about 5 days so far and I'll let it sit for a while.  

Hail Mary!"
"Day Four: Wellerphroaig, Laphreller. William Phroaig.","You tell me what to name my fun blend. .

I took advice from my last post, I didn't do a 50:50

instead I took [this much](http://i.imgur.com/NwWx6gX.jpg) Weller

and then filled the [rest](http://i.imgur.com/hGWWV1N.jpg) with Laphroaig CS 10

I decided to use a couple of my single barrel Wellers, since I have 7 of them, why not. 

Something I've noticed about single barrel wellers compared to the regular, is that they can have a touch of harshness.  Any harshness though, after 4 days of melding has fallen away.   

The Laphroaig's smokey vanilla is already working some magic, and you guys were right that smoke would have way overpowered any weller.  even at this mixture, Laphroaig powers through.  Though now, its a bit rounder in flavor.  The weller gets in there and compliments nicely.  I can picture this after day 30 being its own nice sipper.  

My assumption at this point is that the Laphroaig smoke will mellow out.  I used a brand new bottle, just opened.  

I'm not doing a formal review of notes, rather just some things I'm noticing along the way.

It was also a great excuse to reuse the Rock Hill Farms ""decanter"".

Someone last post said it doesn't matter what Bourbon Mashbill was matured in the cask that Laphroaig uses, it wouldn't have any effect.  I don't think that is true, wont there still be residual juice in the wood? Won't that affect the maturing of Laphroaig?  I'm not 100% on this, but its another reason I wanted to use a wheated bourbon for this blend, because Laphroaig is matured in ex-makers barrels.  Weller just seemed like a good fit. 

cheers","meh
It should be called Old Weller because it needs to be taken out back and shot with a 12 gauge to the face like the rabid dog to the senses that it is.  
The reason I said that I didn't think the bourbon mashbill matters is that it would be such a trace amount of bourbon remaining in the cask, and rye recipe bourbons don't taste as different from wheat recipe bourbons as a lot of people seem to think they do. I think other factors are more important than mash bill in the flavor of a bourbon.

Regardless, this is a cool experiment and I can't wait to read about your results.
Blownin' my mind! I'll wait patiently for 30-days for the real Texacer review, can't wait.
Single barrel Weller...??

Nice decanter - never even heard of Rock Hills. Does anyone else have a bottle they like to reuse for their own blends? 
I'm curious to hear the results.  Next time add some SAOS Cask Strength Rye to the mix. 
I'm not sure that using the Hollywood approach to mashing names together is what you want for this blend. I like the way High West approached it and used a creative metaphor, Camp Fire. I mean you are getting creative with the blend so don't cop out with the name.

loisg cruithneachd = Scotch Gaelic for ""Burned Wheat"" from my shitty googling. I mean you have a Wheater and some smokey Scotch. It was a start. Loisg Cruithneachd might be a mouth full and it takes forever to type. What about a slightly American approach and shorten that shit down to it's essence? Burned Wheat = Toast. Gaelic for toast is who-the-fuck-knows so let's spell it Douphisd which as everyone knows is pronounced TOAST. 

TLDR; Your blend is Douphisd.
How about you stop wasting glorious Laphroaig 10 CS on that Weller garbage?
What kind of weller?
some fanatic. 
why are you wasting time reading about my Peated experiment when you should be hitting up gonewildrequests for booze pics???
thanks for the clarification.  have you ever seen the Corazon Tequila stuff?  :   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pn5ViODJRI
I like the 4r single barrel bottles for blending, personally.
yeah single barrel 107s
we'll see how much the Laphroaig mellows. 
i like Toast.  how bout WheatFire?
I love both!
107 single barrels
You make a good point about the origins of bourbon barrels. You would think that a wheated mashbill, such as makers, would result in a drastically different barrel than, say, a barrel from Four Roses (high-rye). The difference is probably comparable to Oloroso and PX sherry.
This guy's voice and his constant ""Pappy"" comments grate but his ability to review live (assuming his notes weren't written) is pretty damn good.
If I do something like this, it's going in a Signatory Cask Strength bottle, since I've got like 4 now. 
WheatFire, the new expansion pack for Battlefield 5. Wait, wrong sub.
Amen Brother, amen.
yeah thats what I figure.  I assume in both instances the barrels are taken apart, shipped and reassembled at the distillery.  Its not like they refire, wash, or sand down the barrels after first use. 
This makes a ton of sense for shipping purposes, but would they really pull the staves apart? I imagine used staves would start warping after you take the hoops off, like taking braces off of a kid's teeth too early? Though I really am out of my depth here.
yup its true, they dismantle the barrels completely and a cooper puts them back together at the distillery. 
Fascinating! Now I really wanna see this in action...
*Only* for bourbon casks. Sherry casks are so expensive that they are shipped whole to best preserve them.

Bushmill's Black Bush-half a bottle later,"Like my username implies, I am completely new to whiskey (just turned 21, first drink at all was on my 21st birthday) so if you have any recommendations please feel free to submit them to me. I picked up some Bushmill's Black Bush after work today and I am going to try to review it.
First impression: the bottling is very fancy for lack of a better word, I could tell the manufacturer was not some fly-by-night whiskey but a premium brand.""
Taste: (warning I am new to drinking so I am not quite up to date on the lingo) the whiskey was very smooth, almost fruity on my tongue with a sweet aftertaste. There was almost zero throat burn, which for someone who is used to bourbon, the 80 proof mark surprised me. 
When I bought it, I intended to review it so after drinking about half a bottle I think I have a decent general feel for the whisky, which is, I believe it is a great whisky to begin with, it is very smooth and inviting in it's smell and taste. But beware, you can easily consume more than you think you have purely based on how smooth it is and its fruity light flavor","If you like the Irish stuff, /r/worldwhisky is a great resource. 

Smooth generally, especially in this context, is mostly about abv and not a great thing to judge a whisky on. As you grow in this you'll find a difference between harsh/fiery/young and smooth due to water. I like Bushmills, though, good start... if you ever get a chance to try Bushmills 21, run don't walk. 
Another note, I used a whiskey wedge glass for the review, which after thinking about it the chilling might have attributed to the smoothness of the whisky
If you're enjoying the Black Bush then I recommend you try getting your hands on Teeling Small Batch. I've been drinking it a lot lately and it is one of my favorite whiskeys to drink.
so after drinking it again tonight I have a few more thoughts about it, it is a whisky with almostg zero burn with a very sweet taste at the back of the tongue I can't describe as anything other than welcoming, I really like this whiskey. It has, for lack of a better term, a lasting finish of fruit. Overall I cannot thank the lady behind the counter at my local liquor store for recommending this 
>the bottling is very fancy for lack of a better word, I could tell the manufacturer was not some fly-by-night whiskey but a premium brand

Don't judge based off of the bottles and labels.
IMO, the best Irish whiskey is the Bushmills Three Woods (but the 21yo is said to be nice too). If you like Irish whiskeys, however, you'll have a hard time finding a scotch which fits your taste as well.

You might enjoy the Suntory Hibiki.
I had a presentation in my university on whisk(e)y and the professor who supported me on ""technical details"" was joking I have to bring a whisk(e)y for tasting after the presentation. So I did, it was a [Bushmills ""original""](http://www.amathusdrinks.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/w/iwob_1_4.jpg). His description was ""it's a women's whiskey"" -smooth and not burning at all. (He told me a few days later he also bought a bottle). It is a blend like the Black Bush.

Bushmills claims to be the oldest destillery in the world. A very good start. If you want to move to single malt - Bushmills 10 years is also a decent and not so expensive whiskey (well at least here in Europe).

Bushmills was also one of my very first whiskeys I drank without coke.

I started with Bushmills, and here i am, drinking ardberg and loving it. 
The smoothness help to start."
Which Balvenie ? hesitating ...,"Hello guys ! :)

First time on reddit cause I actually figured out this community was maybe the best way to get a large panel of opinions rather than trusting a single dude's review. I'm only 20 but have been a real whisky-fan for about 2-3 years already. Forgive me if my English isn't flawless, as it isn't my mother language ;)

So, let's get started : after having tasted a ""bit of everything"" the last 2 years, I thought Balvenie was something that pleased me a lot among the - let's say - honeyd ones. 12 DW is just one of the best entry-level speysider for anyone and a great bang for your buck, and 14 Carribean Cask was a really nice experience as well. But now I'm considering buying in the next level of Balvenie's family, and I have 3 choices in front of me :

- Tun 1509, Batch 1, for 242‚Ç¨
- Portwood 21 yo 47,6  for 141‚Ç¨
- Single Barrel Sherry 15 yo   for 84‚Ç¨

I've read very elogious reviews on all three, but some less enthusiastic reviews as well. All three seem flawed in a way : 

- Nearly everyone keeps saying 1509 batch 1 is just a mere imitation of 1401, and nothing close to it in term of quality ... but isn't it just a hype from people missing the old tun 1401 days and convincing themselves nothing's ever gonna be any better ? Both Dave Broom and Serge Valentin already scored it above certain 1401 batches, and only a point or two below the most famous ones (3 and 9 e.g.), and many people still describe it as exceptionnal : Drinkhacker gave it an A+, which is nothing common.

- Despite its growth in ABV, going from 40 to 47,6, people still complain about the 21 being ""weakish"" and kind of neutral, watery, ephemeral. Still, I can't help but imagine that Balv distillery's profile should go along terrificly well with port's fruitiness and nuttiness.

- Last but not least, Sherry SB 15 seems much appreciated on reddit and is much more affoardable, but I fear it to be too different from the distillery's inital profil : hasn't a full maturation in sherry butt kind of erased the subtlety of the distillate ? Given I can find Glendronach 15, which I already own and enjoy a lot, for half the price, has this Balvenie really anything ""unique"" to bring on the table but intense sherriness ?

Many thanks to you all for your opinions on these three whiskies. If you could even reply by ranking them from best to worst, that would make my day :)","PW21 is the only one I'd consider. But even then... Eh.
I would consider the Single Barrel sherry. It's good but a little overpriced at usually around $100-110. The PW21 is good, but way too pricey for what you actually get in my mind. The TUN 1509 is not bad, but not worth that price at all. I ended up selling mine at cost after reviewing a sample of it, as it just wasn't worth the price tag compared to the old TUN 1401s.

In short, if I was going to buy one of the 3, I'd buy the Single Barrel Sherry as you get the most bang for your buck.
The times of Tun 1401 have passed us by and with it the days of anything worth buying from Balvenie.
Thanks ! 
Don't agree with all of that. While I wouldn't buy the 1509, I think they still make decent stuff.
Obviously people like different things but in my mind balvenie is one of the weakest Speyside brands right next to Glenmorangie.  That's personal taste obviously and the pricing is pretty awful on top of that.
> Obviously people like different things

NO! Actually the pricing around here is pretty great. Was in a store the other day that had the 12 first fill for like 45$. I was blown away. That's a decent whisky for that price. 

Let's face it, The Balvenie is delicate. Even it's single barrel offerings are 47.6% (or whatever) so they're not really flavor bombs, but they do a good job of not packaging under-aged sclock, if you ask me. With the exception of the 15 Sherry. That shit is a damned dissapointment and a shame.
The 12 SiB is probably the best of the bunch.  I did get my hands on some nonsherried 15 SiB but haven't opened it yet.  DWs are all disappointing, CC is too.  Yep, very delicate as you say.  Great scotches to start with but once the price goes beyond a certain point it seems like they're trying to sell themselves the same as Macallan which isn't really the level their juice is at.
i think the big issue is their obvious branding of flavor. And i get where they are coming from. You want to be recognizable, no matter the expression, but many of them, rather than being crazy taste experiment, end up being The Balvenie plus a flavor. Like the caribbean cask (which, I really enjoy) is The Balvenie plus extra vanilla."
"SUNTORY‚ÄôS HIBIKI 17 YEAR OLD WHISKY - one of the finest whiskies in the world. (Review originally appeared on my site, but thought I'd post it here for you guys as well.)","If you‚Äôve checked out Methods Unsound over the last couple of months, it will have become clear that we have [a pretty big boner for Japan] (http://www.methodsunsound.com/methods-unsound-vs-japan-a-wayward-travel-guide/), from its [bizarre pop culture icons] (http://www.methodsunsound.com/best-and-weirdest-japanese-music/),  to its [sublime beers and delicate buns] (http://www.methodsunsound.com/review-beer-buns-japanese-izakaya-london/), and its confusing acceptance of all things hyper-cute in even the most straight-laced corners of its central metropolis, we are confirmed Japanophiles.

Yet perhaps one of the most surprising things we‚Äôve learned about Japan in recent years is its deeply sophisticated taste for quality whisky. Last year, Suntory beat all Scottish competition for the first time ever with its Yamazaki Single Malt Sherry Cask 2013 being named as Best Whisky in the World, awarded 97.5 marks out of 100 in the 2015 World Whisky Bible and described as a drink of ‚Äúnear incredible genius‚Äù by the hiccuping and mildly slurring powers that be.

Well our fledgling site can‚Äôt come anywhere near sourcing (or affording) that incredibly rare single malt, so we‚Äôll be doing the next best thing and sampling one of Suntory‚Äôs other premium whiskeys‚Ä¶ the Hibiki 17 year old blend. For complete transparency: I got some for my birthday, and I was really good that year and didn‚Äôt ask for any other presents at all.

**hibiki 17 year old whisky**

**Scent**: like burnt oak mixed with buttered candy. Looking at that phrase objectively, that sounds like a horrible combination, but the actual physical effect of this smell makes me want to go to a park, smear a tree with some melted Werther‚Äôs Originals, set fire to it and watch it burn to the fucking ground as it billows its weird sticky sweet smoke all over my naked body. Oh yeah, by the way I‚Äôm naked in this scenario.

**Taste**: incredibly subtle and smooth, in fact for the first few seconds you‚Äôre barely aware you‚Äôre drinking whiskey, but then this coating of warmth blankets your mouth and leaves you with a delicate concoction of nuttiness, spice and an almost umami sense of sweet yet salty sourness. In a way it‚Äôs a perfect entry-level whiskey, delivering absolutely no harshness and hiding its strength through gentle layers of honey and damson.

But then in another way, it‚Äôs for grown-ups only and shouldn‚Äôt be wasted on the non-experienced, which is what I say loudly to any visitors to my flat who see the fancy looking icosikaitetragon shaped bottle (yeah I counted how many sides it has and then looked it up on Wikipedia, what‚Äôs it to ya?) and say ‚Äúoooh that looks fancy and expensive, can I have some?‚Äù

Perhaps whisky snobbery dictates that blends shouldn‚Äôt be held up to the same kind of scrutiny as single malts, because they just can‚Äôt compete in the purity stakes, but Hibiki 17 is by far one of the best whiskies on the planet, single malt or no, and frankly it should be for its ¬£100 price tag. Which is again something I say to people visiting my flat who aren‚Äôt allowed to drink my whisky.

Nobody visits us anymore.

Anyway, I have about half a centimetre of the bottle left now, so whoever leaves a positive comment below can have a lick of the stopper.

There it is.

From what you say, I wouldn't even notice it was there - accurate though that may be - I think I'll pass.

Fuck you and your stopper. I have 4 full bottles at home and I enjoy my nightly ounce.
Hibiki is great, I will definitely have to pick up a bottle of the 21 year no matter the cost next time I'm there.

Also, Mars Maltage 3 plus 25 is amazing
Well, i can't tell from your review if i would like it or not but it's quite elegantly said. 
Enough to make me want to try it! (especially the part where i'm naked and stuff)
Well I'm not the writer, but I'd be wary of taking anything we post at face value ;)
Ah OK, cool thanks, I'll make sure to do that from now on. 
The phrase ""I enjoy my nightly ounce"" has given me the giggles and I fully Intend to use it at every opportunity.
The problem is that I can't tell whether this is serious or not. If it's satire it's not obvious.
It's not satire, it's just general snarkyness - you should see the music reviews. I do wonder if it's a tone barrier thing - Brit vs US you know? Some small things do get lost in translation. Essentially it's an honest review but it's a bit self-mocking.
Maybe? Honestly, without somebody reading it out loud it really is impossible to tell what they're trying to get at for me. Maybe if I knew this person's other writings it'd be obvious, but isolated like this I just don't have the context for this to make very much sense to me.
So was the writer being sarcastic about how good Japanese whisky is AND about how he/she doesn't serve people whisky at the writer's home?

To be honest I think it's either 'you get the tone or you don't', it... may not be a website for everyone (and I'm saying that as someone who wrote 1000 words on 'why Jawas are arseholes' for it a while back). That's not meant to be dickish sorry, but, well it is what it is you know - we write about what we want, how we want :) 
That said - it is VERY good whisky. I can't speak for him but I think he's saying ""this is so amazing I want the whole bottle to myself"".
Ok, I mean, I get it.  You can say whatever you like and post whatever you like.  As a community you won't find a lot of acceptance to snobbery around here so being clear in your tone might help get you greater acceptance.  

The Japanese drams I've had have been underwhelming.  Perhaps I will find one one day that changes my mind.  Smoothness is almost entirely irrelevant to me though so we may be looking in two different directions.
Cool, yeah I agree - honestlyi know the writer and snobbishness doesn't come into it at all. 
That's all I needed to hear.  Thanks for the content!
It is not all I need to hear. From what I gather this is a post, in the wrong sub, by someone other than the author of the words posted, who doesn't identify the discrepancy between poster and author until later in comments, in a post with links to original site of publication? I don't want to hit the links as this sounds like traffic phishing. Am I off?
Don't get me wrong my down vote is staying for those reasons.  As long as the snobbishness is a joke it offends me less so I can live with the other stuff.  I looked at their review of SAOS 7 what a joke.  Definitely not worth going to their site unless you just want laughs."
"Hunting for extreme sherry taste, not just colour.","Hi guys! What is your most heavily tasting of sherry whiskys youve ever encountered?

Let me start by saying I am in no way an expert however for the past six years running myself and friends have attended at least one major London (UK) whisky show plus get together with our own collections 4-6 times a year sampling 6-9 whiskys a night (and we frequently bring back good bottles we bought to previous nights).

Ive experienced at least 200 whiskys in that time however there is one thing which eludes me, those amazingly sherry tasting whiskys where the sherry taste has leached **so much** into the whisky its almost like a sherry liqueur, but not being all sweet and low alcohol like real sherry, still being a whisky of course but tasting heavily sherried.

When I look down the lists of ""heavily sherried"" its a nightmare, obviously anything that strongly tainted will spend its whole life in sherry casks and looking at them many so called sherry monsters arent even that, its been in oak or something and maybe finished in sherry, or the other way..but then even brands such as Glendronach, known for their sherry really dont actually taste fully of sherry.  I still have the remnants of a bottle of Gd 18yo, a friend had the 15, I tried every Glendronach in the range from their table 2 whisky shows (years) ago, its nice, its dry on the palate, sherry-ish but not real sherry. Same with other sherry traditionalists such as Tomatin. Very nice, the 30 is amazing but still, not what I call a full on sherry taste.

I know it exists. For a recent celebration we had a ¬£400 bottle of Longmorn 1964 50yo, damn!! Now THAT is sherried. At one of the shows I had a Glen Grant '58, MMMMMMM, but >1000 a bottle ouch! Also we had a cask strength bottle early on the name of which nobody can remember, not Caol but something like it, again very sherry but so harsh on the strength side (but with a bit of water it just tasted like...good whisky watered down with water as it always does to me).

So there appears to be a gulf, is steeping for 40+ years the only way to get a real sherry taste? The one we cant remember wasnt that old, it was just too strong, where are others like this one? There must be some but going through them blindly based on reviews or hoping to stumble on one at a show doesnt seem to be working.

So fellow Whisky drinkers...what is the most Sherry-Like whisky you have ever encountered? We band of merry men are off to secure our next half dozen glass tubes of amber glory on saturday and I would like to hear your opinions!

Thanks a lot!

","The best example of this I've run across is the Kavalan Soloist Sherry Cask bottled for La Maison Du Whiskey (Cask # S060904027). I've had a lot of huge, old sherry bombs, but nothing has come close to this in terms of almost tasting more like a sherry than a Scotch. A close second is the K&L 24 year Glenfarclas 1990 - a true sherry bomb.

edit: the Kavalan I mentioned was so good - I had to track down a bottle on the secondary after I tried a sample, and I almost never buy anything on secondary.
Glendronach Single Casks PX or Kavalan sherry casks are my sherry heavyweights. 
If you're into sweeter stuff, you might look into port finishes. Amrut Portonova is one of them.
You might want to take a look at Aberlour a'Bunadh, cask strength. By far the most sherried whisky I've tried. 
I have had a couple of Benrinnes IB's that have been heavily sherried. Very rich and sweet. This would probably be the easiest way to get the sherry taste without spending too much. Others may have particular bottlings that are best.
Have you ever added some sherry to some whisky or vatted it for some time?
Can only find the main range at our local emporium.

https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-18121.aspx

That Kavalan looks great but for one thing, the 57.8.  The trouble with the levels of alcohol in the cask strengths is that they tend to burn the knobs off our palates and need respect while consuming so while we do have one or two higher alc. at each tasting evening they arent common, theyre kept for later when our palate is on the way out already and come with a warning at pour. (We learned that from doing a really nice glenfarclas 60% special edition port finish as the second bottle of a meeting, lovely drop but having fried our tongues we were not able to enjoy much of anything for some time after)

So thanks for brining my attention to the Kavlan, I absolutely will grab a taste of that if/when I see it at show. Would really like something more guzzleable about a 40-48 however.
Thanks for the reply, I dont think ive tracked down a PX yet, I see theyve been popular but nothing currently on the whisky exchange shelf (our local mule stop for hooch). Saying that they had a nice 21yo whos name I forgot last year, not mind blowing but was above the standard 21.
Hi! Thanks. The abunadh is lovely, I have about half a bottle of cask #44 left. Not the best cask apparently but a full bodied 60%, could be heavier on the sherry taste however.
Hmm I think capping the ABV that low is going to be hard to find anything great that isn't 35-40+ years old, thus ruling out most affordable (read: under $500) sherry bombs.
Similar vein is the Penderyn sherrywood:

https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-8980.aspx

The master distiller at Penderyn is the same as guy at kavalan. 
Yes, this I see as the main problem and is why there seems to be this gulf. Im just hoping to find out where the boundaries lay, middle ground etc. find some standouts perhaps, if nothing else improve my knowledge on sherried varieties (im wondering for instance what kind of sherry would be best to impart a stronger flavour and which type of barrel wood would be say, more porus to pass that on).

Checking the Glenfarclas they have 1990/25 as the closest (S15 sherry) available but its a 48, great! Its starting to get pricey however its the kinda thing wed look for in our club in single bottle evenings. Noted and thanks.

Good news, Kavalan is already listed as an Exhibitor for this years show so will definitely be following up on that.
I think we had this one last year, I do visit the Penderyn stall each year (ok so the girls pretty) and irrc it was the best on their table but its still too young to be terribly flavoursome.
I mean, when you get to connoisseur levels of age/price, it's gonna be CS. You can't take the water out of the bottle, but you can add it.

Seems like a pretty dumb requirement. 

Just add water.
It never tastes the same, its a long running issue I have with watering whisky. Some do it, Im not keen.

I tried an experiment, worked out the amount of water needed to take one particular cask strength to a normal 43, used speyside water (from glass not plastic) and it still tasted like it was watered down whisky. It just doesnt work out.

Sure I hear all the 'a bit of water opens it up' and a couple of my friends do it on some whiskys but for me its never come out in a good way.

I know its all just water and I dont know why but its never like pouring a 43 straight from the bottle.
You could try adding some water a while before you are going to drink it and it might be a bit more well incorporated - but you'd have to probably pour from the larger bottle into a sample sized bottle and give it a few weeks.  Maybe I'm just a proof whore but it seems I read a lot more comments about people wanting cask strength for full flavor and if you drink higher abv stuff you do adjust to it where it doesn't completely wreck your palate, though I suppose for a tasting of six bottles at a time you might not want them all to be cask strength
Exactly, Our last session the first man out was after the 7th pour, of those one was a CS (we had two more available but not selected that night). We arent afraid of them, many pass our lips but in a social tasting situation we just find they hammer us way too quick to go heavy on them so thats what im looking for, a really nice sub 50 abv full on sherry that doesnt explode cost wise, something we can go a bit heavy on and not worry so much.

Apparently, according to one of the whisky science websites, the water in all but a few hand crafted brands is both filtered and de-ionised so my current thinking is any flavour pollution may be from that.  Otherwise I did think perhaps using a professional centrifuge (or at least perhaps running a sample through the ultrasonic cleaner as I dont have a cf) would help properly mix it and see if thats the cuprit."
Any whiskey advice?,"I really want to try scotch/whiskey, after research It seems that Glenfiddich 12 is a really good scotch to try for a first scotch.  I have tried whisky before but it was Canada House, a really cheap whisky, and I absolutely hated it, I couldn't stomach one swallow. I was looking for reviews on Canada House to see if its common to dislike it, if other whisky connoisseurs liked it or disliked it, and to see if it is a good representation on what most whisky tastes like.  and couldn't find any.  I guess my question to the reddit public is ""Does Canada House Blend Whisky represent Whisky well, or no?""  
 Building off of that, Is Glenfiddich 12 a good starter scotch whisky?,  What are some good Whiskys/scotch to try for a newb? What does whisky taste like? Thank you all!

TL;DR: Is Canada House a good whisky to start on, or is there better?","Gross on that house blend shit. Go with Glenfiddich 12 for sure. If you don't like that then try something smoky perhaps.
What country are you in?  Are you more interested in scotch or other whiskey?  What's your price range?
Since you are looking for a ""Starter Whisky"" and you dont know so far what your taste is like,  
It's hard to give a good advice here...
""Glengoyne 10"", ""Aberlour 15"" and ""Highland Park 12"" are the ones almost everyone of my friends like - they're not too ""heavy"" or ""peaty"".  
Personally I LOVE Whiskies like ""Lagavulin"", ""Laphroaig"" or ""Caol Ila""
I don't know what whiskies you can get in Canada. But if you can, try any of these: 
AnCnoc 12
Auchentoshan 12 (I don't recommend Three Wood)
Any Bruichladdich
Hazelburn (by Springbank)
Glenmorangie 

If you have the opportunity to buy or try a bottle of an independent bottler: don't hesitate 

If you're not used to peated whiskies, start smoothly with Springbank 10. 

Don't try a whisky at cask strength (60 abv) in the beginning. 

Use an appropriate glass. Glencairn or port glass. 

But above all: try and find your own taste. 

Slainte 
Tim
It may be the rye in added to many Canadian whiskies that is turning you off. I'm not sure about the blends on offer though. Glenfiddich is definitely a good starter but if you don't like the taste don't give up. You could try an American Bourbon or perhaps an Islay scotch to see what other flavours might appeal to you.
Canadian, I guess? Try Canadian Club Chairman's select 100% rye. Good and real cheap (at least here, in Montr√©al). If you have some budget, Try Glenmorangie Lasanta. If you have big budget, try Ardberg Uigeadail, but be warned, drink slowly and appreciate every drop of it. If you live in Qu√©bec, it would be a pleasure to share such a precious thing with you!
Alright, glenfiddich 12 was my go-to supermarket whisky for a long time, before I started getting interested in going to whisky shows and experiencing truly great whiskys with my friends.

In the UK here we have a common set of brands in our grocery superstores and this is one of them and as far as 12yo scotch goes its still very acceptable (there is one in my cabinet still, albeit at the back behind other more prestigious but still, its there). Its not really a beginners whisky but its a mans beginner whisky. It has a distinct character, not terribly smooth but likeable and certainly as a mainstream brand you can buy into its ubiquitous reliable nature if you want a dram at a bar say and you want to know what to expect, but as a single experience across a broad range of whisky there are better.

Absolutely one to try however. Its required sampling :)


Like a lot of other stuff in this world, the bigger the production, the lower the quality of the product. Glenfiddich 12yo is an on-the-rocks whisky, imo, and really doesn't taste like much at all. Glenlivet 12 is smoother, but they really don't have a lot of character. 

If you want a true introduction to single malts, pick up a Bowmore 12, Cragganmore 12, Talisker 10, Springbank 10, or Bruichladdich 10. If you are feeling more daring, try a Laphroaig 10 or Lagavulin 16. 

There should be at least one premium bar nearby that will allow you to sample any of these. Don't buy the cow if you can get the milk for free. You should figure out what strikes your fancy. And trust me, it will change over time. 
Alright, glad to hear I'm not the only one who doesn't like Canada House lol The local here has glenfiddich 10, and 12, and Johnny Walker red and blue. 

I am in america, I don't have a preference on what type of whisky, I just have heard good things about scotch, and I'm not looking to spend more than $100 on my first bottle, but I plan to go to the pub to try some first, so no more than $20 for a dram. 
Quick question - I'm only starting to get into whiskeys and have added a Highland Park to my small collection.  To me the smoke from the Highland Park was huge - almost overpowering at times.

Would you say HP is not very smokey?  What other whiskeys would you say would be more smokey or peaty?

Thanks.

It's not all canadian whisky. I've only tried one called canada house, and it's literally $8 for a 5th and comes in a plastic bottle.
Glenfiddich 10? Not sure such a thing exists.  Forget JW Red and Blue.  Red is gross, blue is too expensive by far.
Are you sure it's JW Blue and not Black? In their standard lineup, Red is the lowest while Blue is the highest - just seems strange to skip over the five in between. If it's Black - that's another option to try, otherwise go for either Glenlivet/Glenfiddich.

If you find a bar with some bourbons, Weller 12yr, Elmer T Lee, Buffalo Trace, and Knob Creek are all good ones to try. Any of those bottles should be under $40 if you want to just go for it.
Some easy drams to try at a bar: Glenfiddich or Glenlivet 12, Laphroaig 10(peat), Lagavulin 16(peat and sherry), Macallan 12(sherry)
That's a decent price range.  I would suggest something high quality but in the middle, flavor-wise.  I would recommend Balvenie 12yr Doublewood for scotch (~$50).

Scotch and bourbon are very different from each other.  Since scotch is an imported luxury good priced in British Pounds and Euros, you'll always get a better value in the U.S. drinking domestic bourbon.  I would recommend Maker's Mark as a good start (~$27).

Do you drink any spirits currently?  If you're not used to drinking spirits neat or on the rocks, you might want to mix either of the above with soda water or ginger ale.

EDIT: Glenfiddich is OK, but I don't like it.  It's also not necessarily representative of better single malts (in my opinion).
I recommend Lagavulin 16 as well. If you want heavy smoke Laphroaig is the shit, don't get the 10 year though. The quarter cask is awesome. 
Which America?
Highland Park is nowhere near as smoky as the Hebridean scotches, like Talisker or Lagavulin or Kilchoman. To me I think the sherry barrel is the main flavor in Highland Park, then the peat.
I said ""not too peaty"" ;)  
Compared to some Islay Whiskies like Ardbeg or Laphroaig... Yes, I would say HP is not very ""smokey""  
Of course you are right a glass of HP sends a good amount of smoke right in your face, but it's not too much - I like that
And for someone like OP and his position Black would be just right.
Sorry,  they might have said glenmorangie 10, and between the glenfiddich and JW the glenfiddich sounded better. They might have ment JW black, but the bartender said blue, but she also said it was a $10 dram, so black would make more since.
Yeah I'm positive she said blue, but she probably ment black because she also said it was a $10 dram.  I'll try all of those! Thanks for the list. Of course I'll try them first. There's an Irish pub downtown that has a wide variety so I'm sure they'll have it, the more I try the more I may find I like. I wouldn't mind getting a collection started. I'm already starting a good wine collection.
Thank you, I'll try them all! The more I like the better.
I have heard good things about belvenie, and yeah I know scotch is a little more expensive due to import, but ive heard such good things about it, I'm not against trying some burbon though either, I just turned 21 a short while ago, so I have a better freedom now to dabble and experiment.  My first spirit Is rum, and I do drink that neat alot unless I mix it with coke. Haven't been much of a fan of gin though, and there are only a few vodkas I like. 

Do you have any better ideas for some food single malt scotch for a first timer? Like I said the only whisky I've tried was canada house, and it was a blend of what tasted like gasoline and turpentine lol. I'm looking for something a little smoother, doesn't have to be like water, but good taste and isn't gonna kick my ass on the burn lol.
Tastes differ, of course, but I much prefer the Laphroaig 10 - the Quarter Cask is too woody for me and I've always found Lagavulin 16 a bit disappointing, especially considering the price these days.
The [fuck yeah!](http://youtu.be/MGQaH3-LK54) one!
North
THE America.  
Thanks I'll look out for those and compare. 
I thought about saying black was ok just in case.  
Glenmo 10 is also a good one to start with.
Yeah, you didn't pick the best possible first experience with whiskey, but that's ok. At 21, your palate is still developing, anyway. Hell, at 40, my palate is still developing. I only really started to get into whiskey and whisky more in the last few years. First over rocks or mixed, now I very happily drink it neat.

You've gotten great recommendations for scotch and bourbon. I know bourbon a little better than scotch, and Knob Creek and Maker's Mark are a couple of reasonably low priced, decent quality bourbons that are easy drinkers and good starting points to get into bourbon.

You might also consider Irish whiskey as another avenue starting out; that's what got me going on whiskey in the first place. Something like Jameson over ice is pretty easy to drink (and even easier to find). I was given a bottle of Redbreast 12 that was incredibly enjoyable, though I know it's a bit expensive.

Also, don't discount other varieties of American whiskey. We're experiencing a renaissance, and there are some great rye whiskeys and even American single malts out there.

All in all, you're on the right track. Pick some different things to try. There can be a world of difference between two different scotch whiskys or two different bourbons, almost as big a difference as that between a heavily peated scotch and a sweeter wheated bourbon.  Don't get discouraged if you don't care for the first things you try. Keep looking, enjoy the experience of trying different things by being social with it, and find the whiskey or whisky that you enjoy most. Even if you find that your favorite is largely considered swill, the most important thing is that it's what you like to drink.
Thanks for the additional info.  I stick by my recommendations as being good for a beginner, and others here also have some good recommendations.  If the burn is too much, you can always add a little ice or water as well, but most of the ones recommended shouldn't burn too much if you're already drinking spirits.

Have fun!
True, they are different in flavor, I just find the 10 one a bit rough. The travel exclusives are smoother as well as the quarter. 
I live in Norway, so the difference in price between a good and a bad whisky is not that big due to insane alcohol taxes :-/
So in other words, what they said XD *bald eagle flies over head and fireworks in the distance*
Honestly Black is a great product when one considers its content as compared to price. There are a lot of good scotches that go into JW blends, yes its unfortunate that they also put in some very low grade ones too, but overall JW Black is a easy sipping get your feet wet kind of Dram that will gently get you in the door and then trap you in a sea of so many other choices from there! 
I also agree with the Redbreast recommendation!
Thanks for the in-depth, yeah, I think there's a good variety of suggestions on here, I will experiment more based off of which of these I like. My main thing is at $10-$20 a dram, I didn't want to buy something I absolutely hated because I haven't built up the palate for it, then get scared of trying any others.
It's funny you should say that, but I actually find the 10 goes down easier for me - I think it may be because the oak in the QC threatens to trigger my gag reflex! Not nearly as badly as Macallan or GlenDronach, where I can't even finish a glass in comfort, but I think it may be a similar problem for me...
I like to value scotch blends by their end results and not necessarily the malts they are comprised of but you aren't wrong.  It's pretty easy to drink but Monkey Shoulder or Compass Box artisans Blend might be better. Probably not available at the bar though.
Nor in Canada! I hate what prohibition has done to our country.
Time for a political movement if you ask me. Canadian whisky industry groups have stiff competition these days.
Ya stiff as in they are all Up Tight DICKS!
One day Canada will be forced to open up the markets and Canada Club, Alberta and others will be left in the dust.  Sad times."
George Dickel's Rye Whisky recipe was used to make a beer,"I don't know how r/Whisky feels about whiskey themed beers, and many probably think that this would be better suited for r/Beer. However, after trying this brew I didn't want to tell another beer lover, I wanted to find the opinion of a whiskey drinker!  

I was shipped an early regional access to the Thump Keg's Rye IPA in collaboration with George Dickel. At first I thought it was going to be another beer aged in a whisky barrel with some big name distillery's name on the bottle as a hook. To my surprise, it really had a unique taste that seemed to be a reflection of genuine rye whisky.  

George Dickel Tennessee distillery allowed Thump Keg Brewing Co. to use the exact same grain bill and processes used to create George Dickel's Rye Whisky recipe. They also used the same charcoal filtration that gives George Dickel is smoky and mellow taste.  

Spicy rye, sweet brown sugar notes, mellow vanilla tones from the barrel and a distinct earthy and smoky taste from the charcoal. It was everything I knew to love about whiskey, dissected, broken down, and reassembled into a beer package. 

Anyway, I was just curious if any whisky lovers had tried this, and what their opinions are. I've been learning to appreciate (self-teaching) whisky and detect subtleties for a few years now and this beer broke it down to everything I knew to look for. 


tl;dr: The ingrediants and processes used to make George Dickel Rye Whiskey was used to make a beer. I thought it highlited everything good about beer. 


Here is the website:  www.thumpkeg.com

Here is my review: http://www.factorytwofour.com/thump-keg-rye-ipa-beer-review/","My gosh!  Ima gonna run out and get me some of this right quick.  Nice advertisement.  
I mean, it's not the same ingredients since Dickel isn't hopped and this beer is an IPA. 

Also, I don't believe charcoal filtration adds a smoky flavor. 
I take ""same process"" with a huge grain of salt, but same mashbill is plausible, and I would like to try a 95% rye beer.
Since George Dickel buys their Rye whiskey from MGPi in Indiana, already distilled, what exactly would their involvement be in this?  I am really straining to follow how exactly this could even be true.  Dickel does not produce rye mash, nor would they any involvement in the fermentation, yeast strains, or any other part of the process prior to aging the new make, correct?
Haha, it's always hard to tell if someone's being sarcastic in text. If genuine, I recommend you try it as a single, some people (beer drinkers) I've talked to have been turned off by the flavor and wouldn't want you to get stuck with more than you would like. I think it's a good gateway for beer and whisky enthusiasts to cross paths. Cheers!
With the exception of the hops added (a manditory ingrediant for it to be beer) the mash bill is identicle. Supposedly even similar yeast strains were used. As far as the charcoal goes, I admittedly  still have a lot to learn about whisky. I'll look more into it, thank you for the feedback! 
I think by that they mean, similar fermentation conditions, similar ingrediants and boil process, then the charcoal mellow. so everything but the distillation and barrel. Well... ya know with hops too lol
From my understanding of the process (all information given to me by Diageo, owner of both companies) the same ingrediants (minus the hops, which have to be in there for it to be legally classified as beer) used to make http://www.georgedickel.com/whiskies.aspx#!rye  were taken and used in the traditional beer making process. They then took it and used the same charcoal mellowing process used by George Dickel. This was suppose to make the flavors of the whisky transfer into the beer format. Was this helpful? I've found I have a hard time explaining this concept lol  
Glad you like it, but seems like a gimmick to me. 
Haha you might be right, but at the end of the day if a gimmick tastes good, I'll drink it lol, cheers!"
Buying whisky advice needed (lots of letters),"Hi all,
[short version]
is there some whiskey taste and smell database where could I filter to get narrow number of whiskeys to choose.

[long version]
I've tried writing down whisky names(very few i found) in local shop and reading about them later - results were really bad, as most of brands even Google couldn't find.

Went to specialised shop, was shocked by quantity - scrapped the intention to write down.

Tried watching whisky reviewers (like Ralfy), he is probably good at what hi dies, but to watch all those 500+ videos I should drop my job, also I should build my own database(more time to spent) to compare all his tasting notes.

Tried asking some friends - they either didn't like whisky at all (or drink it with cola) or didn't like the one i'm asking about (bushmills 10)

Went to a local bar.. good thing - big selection, bad thing - my taste and barista(?) tastes are far from similar. Spent too much money on whisky I don't like, but atleast i know what whisky I won't buy ever.

As I see it is very difficult to choose whisky by taste or smell I like, without tasting and smelling it :)

how do You buy Your Whisky? As for now - I don't.. but this is another story

[another story]
two weeks ago, I saw a good deal at local shop (30% price off all whisky), as whisky selection was almost poor (some no name malts and lots of blends) I chose 3 blends which had at least signs of peaty smoke (as I thought) Teachers (highland cream?), Black Grouse and Black Bottle.
Tasted(smelled) all them later... Teachers had the weakest signs of smoke and Grouse - strongest.. i'm not pro, it was my nose talk. as for Black Bottle... wife said shy likes the bottle (flat and black) and we both agreed on that.

I decided to start from weakest (Teachers), as it was also funny to declare myself a teacher for those evenings.
It took me about two  weeks to finish a bottle, I was not in a hurry... I almost enjoyed it.. not the taste.. the smell, that smoke.. while it was somehow week - I enjoyed. 
After two weeks, I was happy as a kid at christmas morning, also I was legally classified as teacher (as I drank whole teachers bottle:)
I was ready for more smoke (I know those blends are not even worth to compare to ardbeg, but I have what I have).
I opened Black Grouse and started to enjoy the smoke smell.. except there was nothing to enjoy.. no smoke... opened Black Bottle... 
also, no smoke.. also wife immediately took away the bottle (as she liked it before).
It seems after two weeks, those blends lost their aromas (if smoke could be called so) and now I have to almost full bottles of whisky which are worse that Johnny Walker red label.

Is this suppose to happen? I didn't notice the mark on bottle label which stated to consume per some days after opening.
The milk I buy can stay up to 5(or more) days opened.. and that was whisky and closed.","staahhhp
Get a Laphroaig 10 or Ardbeg 10.
I'm writing my blog exactly for people like you! Check out my page on whisky at [abvblog.com/whisky](http://www.abvblog.com/whisky). Each review has visual tasting notes, unless I was lazy in which case I should go back and fix that!

To answer your last question: yes. The more aromatic alcohols (scotch, mezcal) can lose a lot of their smell over the course of a month. It's why many big fans have either neutral gas spray or variously sized bottles they can transfer things into, to avoid as much contact with oxygen as possible.

You seem to specifically want smoky scotch, so let me suggest [Laphroaig](http://www.abvblog.com/blog/laphroaig-10-cask-strength) and [Kilchoman](http://www.abvblog.com/blog/kilchoman-machir-bay-islay-single-malt-scotch-whisky-nas) or [Talisker](http://www.abvblog.com/blog/talisker-storm-skye-single-malt-scotch-whisky) but also [High West](http://www.abvblog.com/blog/high-west-campfire-blend-scotch-bourbon-whisky-whiskey).

There are cheaper single malts like Bowmore and Speyburn, which I've yet to put on my site but will soon. Speyburn's got no smoke, but Bowmore does -- albeit accompanied by lots of other weird tastes that you might be able to put aside. [Monkey Shoulder](http://www.abvblog.com/blog/grant-monkey-shoulder-blended-malt-scotch-whisky) is a great affordable 100% malt blend, but is made by Grant which isn't exactly known for their smoke. It's salty and malty, but not smoky.

Teachers, black bottle, black grouse and other blends will have very tenuous amounts of smoke because there's a lot of rectified spirit in there, which will have no smoky quality at all. If you wanna rub your face in a campfire, they just won't do it.

EDIT: McClelland's Islay is great too (it's a Bowmore actually) and at a good price.
After a week or two of being open, smokey whisky will lose a lot of its oomph. The aromas and flavors of smokey whisky are the byproduct of incomplete/inefficient combustion, which makes them especially volatile. 

If you want to prevent this overoxidation you can buy a can of wine-preserving inert gas and spray it in the bottle after each pour.
I want to sit you down in my house and feed you different whiskys and teach you. Sadly I guess you live miles away.
I kind of thought this as well. 
I'm planing, just looking for better deals than paying 60+ euros.
Also hoping its smell would last more than a week.
I saw in local shop few bottles of Speyburn, would be nice to see reviewed. Also I'm not binding my self to smoked ones. I'm looking for smoked one to drink on special occasions... and some lighter(or even sweet like Jameson or Bushmills 10) ones for (almost)everyday sipping.
I guess that single malts are more stable than blends...
as I have Bushmills 10 bottle which is opened about a month ago and smell like freshly opened.
You have years, not weeks. 

I frequently compare new bottles to older ones and there is rarely a lack of oomph in the older bottles. My ~08 Ardbeg oogie, Laphroaig red stripe, and Port Ellen 8th have all been open since 2008 and are still awesome (especially the oogie vs new oogies). Same with Octomore Orpheus and '10 Supernova--they haven't lost any power. 

Cask strength seems to help. I've had a JW Gold open for 7 years @ 40% and all I can taste is the Cardhu and water.
I'd say kilometers, so probably far away :)
but thanks for offer
It's like Rorschach before he went completely bonkers. 

>Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains.
Where in Europe are you? There are several online stores in Europe that sell those for less than 40 euros.

Speyburn 10 is certainly sweet and 43% which is good. For the price, it's pretty much unbeatable. I have a bottle of it, I just haven't gotten the review up yet.

If you wanna see a review of that, let me turn you over to the master, Ralfy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRJowj18Lq0
Bushmills is barely peated though. 
Depends on the climate and temperature where you live. Peated whiskies can fall flat very quickly in warmer/drier climates. 
Nae bother, I'll just keep drinking my whisky.
Lithuania - sending here from other countries costs +25eur till 12 bottles... buying one is not worth, buying more - is more I can handle..
gonna browse shops, as lots of discounts already started.
I know, but I had to buy something my wife can enjoy too.

I'm saying that the effects would be minimal on that bottle because there is so little smoke to begin with and thus a bad bottle to use as evidence that not all bottles lose their flavor, not judging the peatiness of the whisky ;)
if I got it right, as for smoked whiskys,
 either drink fast, either store unopened
unless there is some fancy vine saving tools"
It's that Birthday Dram time of year [Really important post],"So, as is my now yearly tradition, my birthday is coming up (December), and this year I'm planning on hitting [The Feather's Pub](http://thefeatherspub.ca/Menus/TheFeathersSingleMalts/tabid/8483/Default.aspx), who are always nice to me, for some drinks. And some food. And generally to have a nice time.

Yes, this entire post is self-serving, bragging, and all that other stuff, however I like to get input and I typically try to be selfless (at times), so bare with me.

The question that I always have each year is this: Assuming you were in my position, what would you order? Let's pretend like someone else is buying (they are) and there's no real budget (there may end up being one). Which 5 drams would you choose? Which ones would you have as a backup.

Feel free to add anything I didn't list if you think I missed a really nice dram.

I take requests seriously (assuming I haven't reviewed the dram before) and this year I have two trips to try out drams. I always end up posting the reviews in about a week after I try them.

I typically try to review one per region. Also my wife typically picks a Speyside for me to try, and my Dad does as well, so they may veto me for a surprise mystery dram.

**Lowland:**

* Auchentoshan 25 year 1978 (I think this is a Douglas Laing Old Malt Cask, done in Oak Casks, 50% Abv)
* Bladnoch 1987 Signatory (43%, 11 years old)
* Glenkinchie 1978 CS Signatory (21 or 22 years old, 60.8% or 54.6%)
* Linlithgow 1982 Signatory (43%, my birth year, distiller is St. Magdalene)
* Littlemill 21yr Dun Bheagan (46%, Sherry Finish)
* Littlemill 34yr Old Malt Cask Douglas Laing (49.3%)
* Rosebank 10 year Signatory (43%)

I do enjoy Lowland's quite a bit, so it's always nice to try different ones.

I'm leaning towards the Littlemill 21 year, since I was told that the Sherry finish on a Littlemill is not to be passed up. That being said, should I go for a Cask Strength Lowland instead?

**Highland:**

* Ballblair 2001
* Ballblair 15 year 1990/2005 (62.9%, Sherry casks)
* Ben Nevis 1990 Signatory (43%, 8, 9 , or 10 years old, May be sherried)
* Clynelish 10 year old 1989/1999  (50%, Douglas Laing Old Malt Cask)
* Clynelish 1989/2002 Gordon & MacPhail Cask Series (57.1%, Refill Sherry, 13 years)
* Dalmore 1987 Cadenheads (59.8%+, Bourbon cask or hogshead)
* Glenmorangie 21 yo 1981/2002 Sauternes Finish (46%)
* Teaninich 12 yr

Highland is that region I'm always kicking myself to enjoy more and then kicking back because I still don't like it too much.

Kinda want to try the Ballblair 2001. Also should try to get nothing but amazing drams. 

However I also really enjoy a sherried Clynelish or a Bourbon Cask Strength Dalmore, so I'm torn. Not to mention the bloody Glenmorangie 21 Sauternes finish

**Speyside:**

Feel free to recommend a Speyside you would love to try or see reviewed or whatnot, however I'm pretty sure that my wife or Dad will end up picking on for me, so I'm not going to put a list.

**Islay:**

* Ardbeg Lord of the Isles (25 years old, 46%)
* Caol Ila 15 yr 1984 Sig
* Caol Ila 18
* Caol Ila 25 year (53.7%, Hogshead)
* Port Ellen 22 year (1979)
* Port Ellen 20 yr CS (60.9%, 1978 Rare Malts Selection)

Not going to lie: Kinda want to try the Lord of the Isles. Yet there's so much good...

**Island:**

* Arran Sauternes Cask (56.1%, 13 years old)
* Jura 14 year Dun Bheagan (45%)
* Scapa 25 year Douglas Laing OMC (50%, don't know which one specifically)
* Talisker 11 yo 1988/1999 (50%, Douglas Laing Old Malt Cask)

Note I actually like Jura. Though Arran is wonderful too. Though that Scapa is... interesting.


**Campbeltown:**

* Glen Scotia 8 year
* Glen Scotia 1990 Gordon and MacPhail

I've done quite a few of them, so I think I'll pass this year, however that one Glen Scotia from G&M is kinda calling my name.


*Addendum:* The list was last updated in June, so some of these may be out.

*Edit:* So my wife just informed me that during the time when she brings me out, she's picking all of them, all willy nilly and random. I love her. So it's just one trip, making this more of a Sophie's Choice (Well, without the Nazi's... and having to choose a daughter)","If you asked me to choose, I'd get these:

- Port Ellen 20 Rare Malts (tried it, excellent)

- Ardbeg Lord of the Isles

- Littlemill 34 OMC

- Clynelish G&M

- Scapa 25 OMC
[deleted]
My 2 cents, which is probably worth less than that:

Lowland:  The birth year angle is very compelling on the Linlithgow, though you may be right that you should go Littlemill.  I would be very tempted by the 34 year over the 21 year to try something a wee bit older than me (something to look forward)
 
Highland: ""the bloody Glenmorangie 21 Sauternes finish""  Yes.  I wouldn't be able to get past that.

Islay:  I would be sorely tempted by the CS Port Ellen, though I dont have a price list here.  This section looks like all winners.

Island:  If you didn't get the Highland Sauternes earlier, maybe go for the Arran here.  
 
Campbeltown:  (if you don't pass on Cambeltown) G&M.

I would be in so deep over my head here, this looks like you will have a great time.  Happy Birthday in advance, looks like a lot of fun, cheers!
LORD OF THE ISLES!!
Lowland: Glenkinchie '78 CS Signatory

Highland: Dalmore '87 CS Cadenheads

Islay: PE '78 CS Rare Malts

Island: Arran Sauternes





I haven't had any of these, but I would love seeing your reviews on them:

* Lowland: Auchentoshan 25 year 1978
* Highland: Ben Nevis 1990 Signatory
* Islay: Port Ellen 20 yr CS - though Lord of the Isles sounds cool too
* Island: Talisker 11
* Campbeltown: Springbank 15 CS even though it's not on your list.
As far as Highlands go, Oban distiller's edition (I believe based off of the 14) is one of my favorites. Really really tasty.
Sorry for the late comment but I'd really go for the Lord of the Isles if I were you. 

Yummy. Im going to Canada sometime early May. I may go to Feather's Pub if I can. 
Happy early birthday! 

My votes: 

- Caol Ila 25
- Port Ellen 20 CS
- Rosebank 10
- Bladnoch 1987
- Glen Scotia 1990 G&M


Oddly enough, I've heard better about the younger Littlemill, partially due to the sherry cask. Would that change your impression of the older one?
Go right ahead! If you're looking for something more West Side, there's also the Caledonian. A little more expensive, though has some rare malts as well.
So the question is: Given that you're stealing me idea, I think it's fair to ask: Which ones would you pick up? And why?
Thanks, really appreciate the comment.

The Littlemill Sherry cask though... I've had a 47 year, so the whole ""older than me"" angle has lessened a tad.

The CS Port Ellens are about ~27-32 each.
Have you had it or are you the same as me, giggling like a child at the name?
Yeah, the Dalmore Bourbon Cask one is really being a draw on me.

Now, quick question: Why the Glenkinchie?
Thanks for the reply! Really appreciate it.

I've had Oban DE, and while I'll say that it's slightly tastier than the 14, I'm still quite biased against Oban, and oddly enough, the sherry only helped it a little.
Dunno. OMC makes good shit generally. Plus, CS or bust. 
Lord of the Isles is the best whisky I have ever tried 
[deleted]
No and yes. I've not had it, but I want to, and it's probably the funniest non-Benriach name. 
The CS 20y Glenkinchie I've had was really delicious. The standard bottlings are kind of garbage but with lots of age and unfiltered/diluted, it really shines. 
Will get back to you on the group, have to see how often things happen and on what days.
Yeah, I keep ""putting it off"". Last time it was the Ardbeg 1977 that I tried.
That's a good point. It's back in the running.
Good? I've got an IB 21 year old sample coming...
It was tasty as heck.
Glenmorangie 21 Sauternes finish. Do it. 
It is winning out.
maybe if you skip cambeltown you can double down on islay with LOTI and the CS PE...
I could... That may be a good idea... Maybe.. So tempting."
Is Jim Murray way too nice with his reviews & marks ?,"It's been a few months in the whisky world and as im tasting and buying bottles, comparing his reviews with others', im starting to think that jim murray is √† bit too nice in his marks. I agree with many of his marks but at least half of them seem √† bit overrated...

edit: for instance, Glenmorangie's Nectar d'Or ---> 94 ??? WTF. 
","I think people can hold him in too high regard sometimes, after all it is simply just someone else's opinion even if he has a wealth of experience go back that up. But overall I prefer Serge from Whiskyfun over Jim, but they're both worth listening to, just don't follow blindly
Disregard Jim's scores of Glenmorangie and Ardbeg completely, he owns a significant amount of shares in LVMH. 

He's also a bourbon fanboy, so those scores are inflated. Jim Beam White getting 88 and shit like that... 
A lot of it comes down to personal tastes. I think he does score some too high e.g. all Ardbeg, but I think there are a lot that he scores way too low e.g. anytime he detects the slightest hint of sulphur in a sherried whisky. 
I like his notes. His scores... Whatever.
A reviewer is never 100% objective. Nor will, or should his/her reviews be equal to every bodies taste.

Imagine a film critic, They might be good, they might be world renowned, but you don't always agree with their choices as it might be a completely different style that you like. Therefore you only follow someone's suggestions that you know and trust and if not, know when to take it with a pinch of salt.

When you're trying to list a 1000 whiskies, its going to be impossible to be 100% subjective otherwise it will be a meaningless list.

I think he is a great reviewer, some of his favourites are not my favourites, but it would be unfair to force an opinion on all readers that the more complex or niche stuff are the best options, even if I do prefer something a bit off the beaten track.

I have never seen him rate a fantastic whisky poorly, I have also never seen something that is utter shit be rated too high. What he does do well is make it approachable and open peoples eyes that certain over aged Spey's are not really as good as advertisements would like you to believe.



I've often disagreed with Jim Murray's picks. I much prefer John Hansell, Lew Bryson and Paul Pacult. I know the three of them and all three call it like they see it (and have all been inspirational in my writing career)
Jim Murray:

- Ardbeg 10: Well oh well if this isn't the elixir of the godz??1 Score: 101/100.

Easy to rate LVMH whiskies in the stratosphere when you're a shareholder in them... 
Yeah, Serge seems more demanding....
How did he become famous anyways?
>Disregard Jim's scores of Glenmorangie and Ardbeg completely, he owns a significant amount of shares in LVMH.

Really? Where did you hear this?
It's just about personal taste. The only way to ever get annoyed by someone else's score, is if you misconstrue it as something aspiring to objectivity, which I don't think any reviewer does.

p.s. I also hare sulphur notes in sherried whisky.
His PC6 notes are hilarious. 
I've just found a nice article over at Dramming that's worth a read on the subject.

I assume simply persistance and after Michael Jackson passed away he was the logical choice for a good buyers guide. I know he used to write for The Telegraph newspaper here in the UK which might he helped him get his name out there.
I think he's said it publicly. I'll give it a Google when I get home. 
What the hell http://www.bruichladdich.com/article/orgasmic-whisky-pc6-single-malt
mmmmmmmmmm
Fully agreed, excellent article!
I'm pretty sure he refutes that he's on anyone's payroll but his own. He has consulted for some distilleries though, leading more to *allegations* of partiality. For some he's rather too friendly towards certain distilleries but he does work in the industry, not in a bubble outside it. Love him or loathe him you can't knock his level of experience, but his scores aren't the only truth."
"Rmill3r's top whiskies by score, and what is next?","I reached 100 (scotch) reviews not too long ago and ended up taking a little break as I was feeling a little burnt out. I'm warming up to it again and I remembered that I wanted to take a look back at all of my reviews and order them to see what it looked like.

Looking back, my scores definitely had a rhyme and reason to them, but there were times when it was a bit arbitrary. This list isn't *entirely* representative of what I like/dislike and what order I like/dislike them in, but at the same time, those were my first impressions, so they're pretty true to my tastes.

Anyway, the whole point of this is I want something new. I'm looking for that next wow-factor bottle. Even if it doesn't necessarily ""wow"" me, I'm just looking for something different and unique. Based on the list below, what would you say I should aim for next?

What does your top whiskies list look like right now? Cheers!","Pappy Van Winkle 23, Laphroaig 40 year old, Highland Park 50, Mellow Corn.

I'm helping
I think its ridiculous that you gave the Portwood 100/100...

Anyhoo, looks like you need to check out Amrut. 
You might be looking for more of a Scotch suggestion, but what jumped out to me was that you definitely have some Rye whiskey rated highly, and yet there is more room to explore Rye.  High West Rendezvous?  Colonel EH Taylor Rye?  Maybe Whistlepig?
I bet you'd love Caol Ila independent bottlings
red label wasn't last!
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aH_HhqFiMNLtsT3kKlSO3gkUgvpBBd1WsiJcUtMuCDU/edit?usp=sharing

Here's my list of reviews, seeing as though you asked nicely! 
I'd like to see them separated by scotch and american! Apples to oranges imo. 

Awesome list though, I'm jealous.
One of these things is not like the other...
I was thinking more Japanese if I go the world whisky route, but yeah, Amrut is definitely at the top of the list, too. What would you start with?
Any favorites?
92 for a single barrel Buffalo Trace? I *have* to agree...I think I gave regular old Buffalo Trace a mid-80s score. I definitely enjoy it and there's this one bar that pours it neat for like $5 and it's definitely my go-to if I'm out and about but I'm not crazy about the stuff. Then I found a big local shop that had their own hand-picked single barrel version of the stuff and it was much, much more interesting. 
yea, I hear Pappy is way over rated.........
I haven't had any but I bought a bottle of the Single Malt CS and Portnova but I think the Fusion is the most accessible.
Cask strength is great, and even the 46% version is quite good. The intermediate sherry is enjoyable but kinda adds a sherry finish to a whisky that's plenty good without it. I want to try the Portonova next. 
Regarding Japanese whisky...I'd recommend trying a flight at a bar if you can. I tried 1oz pours of Hakushu 12 Nikka Taketsuru 12, and Nikka Yoichi 15 and that satisfied my curiosity for now. They're very refined, but not particularly interesting. Try before you buy. 
Gordon & McPhail 10yr 46% is great, and I've heard wonderful things about G&M and Signatory cask strength offerings [(for instance)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aBZ_UMLIiA)
Gotta agree with you there, regular BT is good, just not 90+ good. They must really have some crumby barrels that pull down the quality that the single barrels show. 
Amrut CS is lovely. I just got my bottle yesterday. "
how to do a good whisky tasting,"I would like to organize a whisky tasting for myself and a couple of whisky-loving-friends. I would like to do this in a bit of an organized fashion; meaning that we would like write down tasting notes for comparison and to inspire future purchases ;-)

What would be the best variables to rate them on? (look, nose, taste, finish, etc)
and should i use a set of predefined flavours or let everyone just write down whatever they like?

love to hear your input!","A couple of tips:

1. Glasses.  Make sure you get appropriate glasses for this.  I would recommend: http://www.whiskyglass.com/

2. Set-up.  When setting up a whiskey tasting you can go about it in a number of ways.  The two that I find the most enjoyable are: Completely different whiskies (ie, 1 rye, 1 scotch, 1 bourbon, 1 irish etc).  This allows everyone to really see the differences in the regional expressions.
The other is to stay within 1 expression.  All Bourbon, all rye etc.  When it comes to scotch you can get even more specific and do specific regions (ie lowland, highland, Speyside etc)

3. Water.  If you really want to get fancy you should have a couple of eye droppers with distilled water.  This allows people to control how much water they put into their glass.  Even a couple of drops can make a remarkable difference.

As for the actual tasting... I will let someone else answer that.
What I'd suggest is that you keep the notes hidden to begin with. The power of suggestion is super powerful, so if you give people tasting notes, that is literally all they'll be able to detect. 

Ask people what they thought of the whisky after they've tasted it - some people won't have an opinion, but others will. Some won't say anything unless asked.

At the end, have a vote on your favourites of the day. 

The rest is largely up to you.
* Glencairns are a must in my opinion; it just makes it easier for people to get more out of the nose, especially those who aren't used to it.
* Pick a theme and stick with it, especially for the first few.  It could be all bourbons, or all Single Malt Scotch from Islay, or one of each (Islay, Highland, Island, Speyside, Campbeltown, Lowland) or one of each type (Bourbon, World, Scotch, Japanese or something along those lines)
* I think the sweet spot is 4-5 whiskies. More than that and it can start to get too much for a palate to handle.
* Don't give out notes ahead of time, and if possible, do them ""blind"" so that people aren't prejudiced by names or packaging. 
* Have fun.  Don't make it more serious and rigorous than you have too; remember, this is to have fun and enjoy whisky.
I see most people recommend the GlenCairn glass. They are great, but in my opinion the ""Spiegelau Whisky Snifter"" is the most perfect glass. It is a lot bigger than traditional scotch glasses, which gives the most perfect nose.

Adding water will be relevant for whiskies at cask strength. The most common whiskies contain about 40% or 46% alcohol because the Destiller already added plenty of water.

If you choose a scotch whisky theme, you can easily combine the regions. But keep in mind, that the ""weakest"" or the sweetest whisky should be starter, and the heaviest or most peated should be the last. If not, you risk messing up the taste of the other whiskies.

Finally, never tell anobody what to taste. Let the fantasy flow freely. I have heard people describing a taste like ""wet pencil"" or ""burned rubber"".

Have fun!
I went on a tasting session at the weekend.

Things to take into account are

1.Water and a pipette - ideally speyside water but w/e.  Just not tap water.
2. Proper glasses
3. One thing I never knew is that, ideally, you want to leave the whisky in your mouth the same amount of seconds as years of age of the whisky.  So, in example, the Ben Riach 17 year I bought (LOVELY) should really be kept in your mouth 17 seconds - I've never made it that far though.

Most of all have fun.
Thanks for the reply, but what about people lacking a decent vocabulairy to describe the flavours they are tasting. Wouldnt it help to give them some suggestions regarding commonly found flavours in whisky while tasting?
Also, providing an overview of terminology for tasting would make comparing notes much easier...

what are your oppinions on this?
The tap water thing depends where you live and what access you have to quality water. In Australia for instance tap water is some of the purest and cleanest in the world. 
It depends on your expectations. Do you want to be a bad ass scotch guru(or at least in the making), or do you enjoy just the social aspect of the tasting?

Actually, a few hours ago I wrote about a ""tool"" called Nez du Vin. It helps people specify exactly what they smell in the whisky. Is it pineapple, peach, apple or so on. 54 different nuances. Stuff like that is great if you want to be an expert yourself.

If your primary goal is to enjoy whisky with friends, I find it a lot more exiting to discuss the nose/taste. If it is fruity, what fruit does it taste like? What spices do you taste? ...and so on. Make it a conversation. You can learn a lot from that only.

I have been at a lot of tastings, and I have to say that a great part of the exitement disappears, when I am told how the stuff tastes.

Finally, everybody have different ways of smelling, tasting and feeling the whisky. That's why there is no actual facit of what a whisky tastes like.
when i hosted my tasting, i printed off the nosing/tasting chart from the sidebar. my friends found it helpful for putting names to the tastes they experienced, without it being specific to that dram. 

it was a ton of fun.. here's a link to my write-up in case you're looking for other ideas: http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/20heq5/muaddib99s_first_scotch_tasting_party_5_guys_6/ "
Whisky Review Archive suggestion,"Would anyone else like to see the addition of a ""notes"" category in the Whisky Review Archive?  It should be an easy addition to the Archive's submission form, and it would be nice to be able to add a small bit of additional information to certain types of reviews.

For instance:

* Batch information (for Bookers, etc.)
* Year (Evan Williams SB, BTAC)
* Type of barrel (sherry, bourbon, etc) for Scotch.

And I'm sure others can think of many other uses for it.

I don't think the notes column would need to be standardized or sortable in any way, just a short place to add a relevant note to your review.

Thoughts?","I don't think it's a bad idea, but Google Sheets chugs along with the archive as it is. The archive needs to be moved to one of the new Google Sheets forms, then it could probably accommodate it. I just keep a separate sheet with all of my reviews, notes, etc.

I have a more comprehensive list as well, but I think the benefit would be when you're deciding on something new.  Knowing what batch, year, or finish it was that other people had and loved or hated.
I have just started one for myself, it's a very good idea! "
Recommend a bottle to us - not to buy,"Kilbeggan Irish whisky is the worst crappy shitsky I've ever had and I wanted to spit it out. Worse scored than Johnnie Red, Ron Burg Blend, or even Scotch in a Can. 

[I recommend staying away](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhiskeyReviews/comments/18qkzy/kilbeggan_blend/)

what about you?  And keep it to things that are just bad, not personal tastes like someone who hates peat ie STAY AWAY FROM LAPHROAIG! etc. 

in other words: of the side of whisky you prefer, tell us the worst bottle you've had that we should avoid buying at all costs. ","Bakers Bourbon. I'm fairly sensitive to the Jim Beam ""yeast funk"", and the bottle of Bakers I had was so yeasty it almost made me sick just to smell it. Never again. 
I ordered Auchentoshan Classic at a bar expecting it to be OK at best, but wow was it a chore to get through 2 ounces of it. 

The kicker is that I liked Auchentoshan Three Wood a lot the first few times I tried it, but when I bought a bottle and cracked it after having suffered through the classic, the off-note that they both share (though it is faint in the Three Wood and overwhelming in the Classic) was suddenly more noticeable and tempered my enjoyment of it. 

TL;DR- Auchentoshan Classic was so bad that it made me like a different Auchentoshan bottling less. 
Johnnie red is simply disgusting.
I love bourbons, and high rye bourbons in particular, but for some reason I hate Very Old Barton and 1792 Ridgemont Reserve (also Barton).  Tastes like cough syrup.  Cloying.

I don't plan on buying it again, but other people seem to not be bothered by those notes, so eh, who am I to tell you not to drink it.
Crown Royal Maple.

I appreciate my Secret Santa sending me some, as I wondered about it.

Now, I've tried flavoured whisky before. I like Seagram's 7 Honey. I've enjoyed Heaven Hills Maple flavoured syrup. And if I can't drink them, I can mix them.

And If I can't mix them, I can heat it up and pour them on pancakes (seriously).

Never have I found a whisky that I just can't use. Couldn't drink it, couldn't mix it, and couldn't use it on pancakes. Just no balance on the flavour at all.

**TL;DR**: Buy other flavoured whiskies, if you must.
Corsair's Quinoa Whiskey. Fuck that awful shit.  
Lexington Bourbon. The worst of all the sourced bourbons. 
Bowmore Legend. I somehow rated it in the 70's....I was young(er) and dumb(er)
It's no comes-in-a-gasoline-can-for-$5 moonshine, but I would recommend people stay away from Hancock's President's Reserve bourbon. I can't drink it ‚Äî gave my bottle away for use as a mixer ‚Äî and for a retail price of $40 to $50 I don't know how it's still around
Wasmunds single malt. Fuck everything about that whiskey.
ISAWA 25 1983 FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T BUY IT I KNOW IT'S CHEAP FOR A 25 YEAR OLD JAPANESE WHISKY BUT JESUS CHRIST IT'S CHEAP FOR A REASON.
Tobermory 10 and Ledaig 10. Just not good.
Worst Irish Whiskey: Powers Gold entry level - bland and gross.  

Bourbon:  
Anything less than 86 proof.  

Canadian:  90% of Canadian whiskeys should be avoided...
New Holland has something called Walleye Rye that I picked up on a whim while on a beer run a week ago.  Don't know why I grabbed it, but I did.  It's aged in little wood barrels and tastes odd.  Tastes like new wood.  It tastes like you're sucking on a freshly cut oak board that's been soaked in a middling rye.  Oh, the things I could have done with that $23. 

  
Corner Creek Bourbon. There was some real off note, no thanks to this forever & ever
Glen Morven Single Malt 12. It was a ‚Ç¨20 bottle, I should've known better.
Ardbeg Blasda seems like a no no
Islay - Bowmore. Pretty much any offering I've had has been bad. Never thought I'd find an Islay I dislike.
Definitely the optimum spirits eco refill [pack] ( http://i.imgur.com/TDebtrph.jpg

http://reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1ff0ks/review_3_optimum_spirits_blended_whisky_shudder/) just awful 
Avoid Silver Seal Muirhead.  Their younger stuff didn't even taste like Scotch.  The older stuff was very forgettable.  I mean it wasn't repulsive but I would avoid anything by them.
Koval Bourbon, smells like a barn or something. Not what I look for in a whiskey 
Cleveland whiskey is my horse. 
Jefferson's Small batch is pretty bad...  the only ""chore"" bourbon I own.
Jack Daniels. Jack Daniels Gentleman Jack.
I think we all knew this. 
Why so sensitive?? 

I'm assuming you aren't a KCSB or Booker's fan.  

Agreed, avoid Baker's. I didn't think my bottle was gross, it was just bland and didn't have much character. This stuff is incredibly overpriced. Booker's is way better and comes with only a small bump in price.
You're not the first one I've heard say they dislike the JB ""yeast funk.""
I found Baker's to not be too bad, Knob Creek is the JB Yeast-fest that I stay away from. 
I had a full bottle of Classic.  ugh
> Crown Royal Maple.

I was at a tasting and the person across the table from me ordered a glass of this stuff. I could smell it before the waitress got it to the table: a wave of sickly-sweet syrup overwhelming the entire space. I had to wait until the glass was gone before I was able to smell my dram at all
It makes good cookies.  Crown put out a recipe last summer.
> Corsair's Quinoa Whiskey


that just sounds gross.  especially the Cosair part. 


I tried a dram of this at a bar and it was baaaaaaaad. 
Hunh. I thought it was drinkable.
There's alot of bad (or overpriced) sourced bourbons out there.  

That is definitely a buyer beware market.  
Agree. Bowmore Legend is a waste of money, even though it's cheap.
It is one the worst whiskies I have ever tasted by a very wide margin - there's a select group all around the same level of hatefulness. For some perverse reason I really want a bottle.
which is why I didnt do the community cask, big gamble for the price on a distillery I mostly dont care for.  The 15 is great stuff but costs way too much. 
Powers Gold Label was the first Irish I ever bought, and I agree in saying that it's bland.  I don't think it's so gross, but I've still got my mostly full bottle that I'll probably never drink (unless I'm bombed already and decide to start pouring whisky, then I'll grab it).  Tastes like lightly flavored water.  Pour it into your nalgene and take it to the gym.  
I quite like both of those, actually. Bakers was just over the top yeast for me, where in Booker's and KCSB I can't even detect the yeast. 
Interesting how tastes differ! Enjoy your Bakers :]
It's not even strong enough to be practical as lighter fluid. 

And I sure wouldn't wanna cook with it. 
Ever had a friend that's a weekend wannabe-Michelin-rated chef that tried to convince you that their quinoa salad was the bees knees, only to taste it and realize it's just as gross as any other quinoa salad you've had?

Yeah this is that, but with whiskey. Terrible, it ruined my palate and was the only thing I could taste for the rest of the World of Whiskies night.
It's bad enough that I was surprised they released it at all. Just terrible.
In my experience, most cheap scotch whiskies are wastes of money. I don't think I've had anything (aside from Great Odin's Raven oddly enough) That was enjoyable below $35-$40.  
Definitely find one of the young sherry monster Ledaigs if you can - they're nothing like the painfully remembered NAS version. The sherry seems to hide some of the evil...
nalgene?  what's that..? 


Ok Baker's is on my to - do list.... 

I think all Beam products should be bottled at a higher proof.. 
I only bought a nip of it, It's about $50 around me and I can't stomach that price for a full bottle of it! 
that sucks.  at least you learned your lesson
>Terrible, it ruined my palate and was the only thing I could taste for the rest of the World of Whiskies night.

Reminds me when I tried some [Wenjun](http://www.lvmh.com/the-group/lvmh-companies-and-brands/wines-spirits/wenjun) at a festival.  Took forever to clean out my tasting glass with various vodkas to remove the odour and taste.  Tasting notes I read online, afterwards were ""Somewhere in between a Kirsch and Amaretto but with a feral dimension that‚Äôs difficult to pin down"".  Feral all right -- if ""Feral"" means ""wild skunk"".
There's a bar near my place that has almost entirely unaged spirits (lots of moonshine) and the two I've tried there are Buffalo Trace Wheated Mashbill White Dog and High West Silver Oat...and I didn't like either of them. I'll stick to aged whiskey from now on. 

Outside of their two unaged offerings, which High West whiskeys have you had?

Edit: this was supposed to be a reply to [this comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/248223/review_8_high_west_rendezvous_rye/ch561sp)
This is generally an unpopular opinion in this subreddit, but I don't mind Tomatin 12. I think it's a good deal for the price and have used it successfully to turn other people on to scotch. It's probably the least complex/flavorful bottle I keep around, but serves a purpose.
[This.](http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/09-nalgene.jpg)
yea, I've always felt Booker's needed a higher ABV...but back in reality, I think they don't care if we like high proof stuff, they're selling to a larger market who is used to 40% & cool with it (and given how popular under 40% ABV whiskey-based flavored alcohol drink, we know it's just the lawman keeping straight bourbon at 40+%).


Naturally, you already know this, and you return their uncaring attitude
Luckily it was towards the end.
Rendezvous, APR, Son of Bourye, 16, 21, Campfire. All fantastic. (I really liked the Silver Oat, though.) 
gotcha.... so you drink irish at the gym and scotch in the library? 


Hhaaha... yeah I should have excluded KCSB and Booker's from that list of ""need to be bottled at a higher proof"" Thank you for pointing out my stupidity. :)  

I feel the Beam corp has two personalities.  One is the cheap 40% BEAM lineup which they are recently branching out with the single barrel edition and the signature collection.  So going higher end at the same time of increasing the flavor whiskey profile of course so low end.  

The other would be their small batch collection.   This has remain pretty consistent over the years.  With the exception of the flavored Knob Creek 
I DO give Beam credit for keeping their whiskey flavored at 80 proof.  Most to all bottle their flavored whiskeys less than 80 proof.  Fireball and JD flavored are under 80 proof.  

If they wanted MORE money it be less then 80 
I'm pretty cool with most grains, but quinoa is not my thing.  and a whiskey made with it?  naw.  
Whoops, I switched threads. Thought this was in reply to you saying you didn't like High West's unaged rye. >_<
and bourbon/rye on my way from the gym to the library.
I was just having fun, I knew you meant the Beam branded stuff. It's a common biz structure, was reminded in that thing I posted that Sazerac does the same, just they don't have the wide brand recognition of a Beam to use that name to push flavored or more mass directed products. But they produce & sell lotsa stuff we don't wanna even sniff (which is fine, so long as they keep torturing me with Stagg hunts, my life will have purpose & adventure)
No worries, my answer stands :)
haha.. i like your style...  
We all need a little fun!  I agree we (the whiskey community) tittle our thumbs in perperation of the Fall hunting season..... Is it Sept yet? 

Sazerac definitely makes some questionable whiskey but out of their Barton distillery it seems.  
I love how Buffalo Trace is proud that they don't make any flavored whiskey but their parent corporation has the best selling flavored whiskey on the market.  
people follow you around to downvote you? I've noticed
Is that good or bad... I don't really follow the upvote or downvote scene.  "
Request for feedback: My reviews,"So, I've noticed a trend recently where I'm not getting a lot of comments to my reviews. So I started wondering if there was something wrong with my format, style or content. I want your opinions, folks!

Do you read my reviews? Have you ever read my reviews? 

* **Yes?** Great, tell me what you think! 

* **No?** Yes you do, liar. Tell me what you think.

Here are some ideas I had about what I might be doing wrong, or not doing right enough. Which sound like the best to focus on? Do you have any others that you think would improve my content? Let me know.

- Wrote betterer, like TOModera or rmill3r? I've tried to keep my reviews somewhat clean, yet descriptive. They're filled with my opinions, rather than trying to be totally objective. I guess I could swing more either way. I know my early reviews leaned more on colourful language than on detailed notes - maybe people would prefer more colour? I don't know! You tell me.

- Reviewed more easily available whiskies? Apart from that pesky bit where I've already reviewed most of the entry level whiskies. I guess I could review blends, but that's quite a lot of suffering for my craft...

- Wrote more about the distilleries themselves? I've always tried to keep my preambles somewhat brief while still saying something about the distillery and my experiences with them. 

- Did more blind tastings? This is totally doable, because I have a girlfriend who could pick and pour a sample for me without me knowing what it was. 

- Dropped the catchphrase? Honestly, at this point I've just pasted it into my template for shits and giggles. It's not particularly serious, and it mostly just cracks me up. But do you like it? Let's find out! 

- Did more extensive vertical/horizontal/diagonal review roundups? I've got enough samples that some of this is probably quite doable. I could also hold off on posting reviews until I have samples that form a somewhat coherent theme. 

- Did more re-reviews? What do I think of Talisker 10 after 150 whiskies? Actually, [I already did that one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1w85ei/reviews_135136_laphroaig_quarter_cask_talisker_10/cezjoqi). But I could do more.

- Try even more weirder stuff? This one's a bit harder to do, but I could try. I'm currently still in the midst of trying to check off every distillery in Scotland. But I'm willing. The wallet may not be, though...

- Focused more on alternatives to what I'm reviewing? Generally, I try to suggest a few similar malts in my reviews, but I could break it off into a section of ""Most Like"". Would that be useful? 

Anyway, I like writing reviews, and I like being useful to you guys. Right now I know I'm doing the former, but I don't know if I'm doing the latter as well as I could. I'd be perfectly fine spending some more time writing and polishing if it helped you. 

Help me spend my money to help you more. Thanks!

","I quite like your reviews, actually. I like seeing more comments and thoughts than notes, as it gives me more insight into how much you actually enjoyed something. I'm trying to get more commentary like that in my reviews. I think I mentioned you in a conversation somewhere as a good reviewer yesterday...
I don't see anything wrong with your reviews. Most of them are just not as known to majority of the network I guess. I didn't even know there was an IB called ""The Ultimate"". 

It could also be that people are just busier? I haven't been able go around and see a lot of the reviews lately coz I'm busier than usual.
I'll give you a review of your reviews in a second, however first I'd like to review the idea of reviewing your reviews based on comments (Dawg). Because I'd like to note that comments don't really mean... anything.

Let's look at recent reviews you did where you had a lot of comments: Angel's Envy Cask Strength, BenRiach 16 Sauternes Finish, and Maker's Mark.

Were these reviews in any way different, more fun, or more accurate than your review, let's say, of Laphroaig QA Cask? or Ardmore Traditional Cask? No.

In the case of AECS and MM, each of these are more accessible drams that most people have had. Which means that your average reader of reviews will be able to make a comment.  In addition, you said you didn't like Maker's Mark, so that just amped up the Bourbon angst that much more.

So why did BenRiach 16 Sauternes get so many comments? Well you talked about Sauternes finishes, Glenmorangie Nectar D'Or 15, and BenRiach. All of these are things people can relate to, and comment on.

Also it could be the time of day that you posted, which means that it's at the mercy of finding those people it will connect with through their front page. If someone has one of the top subreddits, then a lot of the whisky network posts will be lost in them.

And it's not just you, either. Look at my reviews. The most comments go to Caol Ila Cask Strength (37), Balvenie 30 (20), Ardbeg Corryvreckan (30), and Ardbeg 32 (21). Note that Caol Ila Cask Strength has more comments than a 32 year old, pre-takeover, IB, Cask Strength Ardbeg!

And it gets more ridiculous from there: I posted a 6 part review for BenRiach and had 7 comments. I've done so many IBs that only have 1 review, I've just come upon it.

So basically, comments don't mean jack.

That all said, I'd say if you're not happy with your reviewing format, and want to do something different, do it. Upvotes don't really matter in the end, we're having fun, and most of us really do enjoy the IB reviews you do. I personally find your reviews really easy and nice to read. They're super clean, you get to the point, and I understand why you thought the way you did.

If you want to evoke more comments, make more comparisons to what people know about, talk up the processes that went into each one, talk about deals/finishes, etc. May get more commentary coming in, and it may not.
maybe you smell

[Dworgi reviews by date](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?hl=en_US&hl=en_US&key=0AsnkEzAVwhUVdF91M3R1NFdvQWYwY1JEeHNpNnZCbVE&type=view&gid=0&f=true&colid0=1&filterstr0=Dworgi&sortcolid=4&sortasc=false&rowsperpage=10000)
Your reviews are fine in my opinion. Unusual/IB reviews just don't get a lot of interest. My theory is that if people can't relate to the expression you are reviewing, they have no interest in commenting/upvoting. It happens to me all the time. 
I think your reviews are solid, man.  I think /u/thatguy142 makes a valid observation about the relative obscurity of some of your reviews, which only means that some people may feel like they can't offer much in the way of comments or critiques.  I don't think it's true that you can't comment on a whisky you've never heard of, but I get that it could be intimidating for some folks.  

Let me run through some of your bullet points (in no particular order):

* You do write well, and I think after 150+ reviews you've settled on a style that's yours.  Doesn't mean you can't update/add/subtract from your template, but if you aren't naturally using colorful language it's going to feel forced if you start.  Your style and personality do come through in your reviews, much like with someone like /u/TOModera.  He has a style different from yours, and his reviews work because they feel genuine.  Much like yours.  

* Keep the catchphrase, you've earned it.  

* Should you review more easily available whiskies?  Only if they really interest you.  Even if it's strictly for science, if it doesn't interest you don't review it.  

* Yeah, I think re-reviewing things can be great, and you've got the credentials to make it interesting.

* I think a Most Like list could be really interesting, fun, and useful.

* Vertical/horizontal/diagonal review roundups are also fun, and I love seeing folks putting these together.  Talk about a great way to thoroughly introduce someone to a distillery and/or style.  Also cool in my book: personal review recaps, just like /u/texacer has done.  I like these kinds of recaps because they're a fun way to spend time talking about a particular distillery and your experiences with them (if you've done this kind of thing, sorry!).

This is where I stop babbling.  In short, some of your reviews are rarefied, sure, but that doesn't make them less interesting!  Keep up the good work.
Seriously mate, who cares if you get comments? Just keep doing what you're doing.
I saw it (thanks to the miracles of gold!), might have contributed to thinking about how I would improve.
Well, sure, I've noticed the accessibility aspect a lot as well. 

I've also noticed that a guaranteed way to generate a lot of discussion is to: a) review something cheap and common, b) completely slate it. The sheer number of angry comments amuses me every time.

I'm sure that people do actually read the reviews, but since there isn't a view counter (which would be awful), comments and upvotes are all you have to go on to judge if people thought your review was helpful or not.

Sure, I could change my review format arbitrarily, but I'm using the magic of the internet to ask people if there's anything in particular they think I'm missing. Not because I'm upset people don't comment or upvote, but because I'm genuinely curious about whether people see any potential for improvement.

I'm pretty happy with my review format, personally, but if there's something that people would like to see then I'm all for doing it.

I'll probably try adding a ""Most Like"" field to summarize the comparisons I inevitably make. Seems easy enough to do, and it would perhaps help someone out. I already added ""Buy Again?"" field, even though it seems to be filled with ""No."" most of the time...
That's not even all. 

I'm really lazy about archiving, I'm probably a week behind. Generally do a batch of them at work when there's some downtime.
Exactly! It's hard to say much about an expression of an IB of never heard of distilled by a distillery I've never heard of that generates a high 70/low 80 score. I typically comment on reviews that are of a whisky that I have strong opinions about or want to try. 
Personal review recaps? Not sure I've seen those by tex, or at least not noticed them.
I dont really see a problem with them.  I get all sorts of different numbers of comments as well. 

only thing I'd say is maybe try and condense your notes a bit to be concise:

---

**Auchentoshan 12**  
*Lowland, 40% ABV, E150, CF, 50ml mini*

**Nose**: Fruity. Dry apple cider and fermented apples. Red apple. Minerallic and metallic. Citrus, lime. Caramel and malt. Orange melon.

I actually can't get past how cider-y this nose is, it's like an unfiltered apple cider without the yeastiness. Shame, since I don't like cider. Lowlands metallic thing also in evidence. 

**Taste**: Thin, but somewhat oily. Red apple peel and apple cider. Sour lemon. Toffee and sweet malt. Metallic. Lightly bitter and biting. 

I dunno, not enjoying this but I can't say why. There's this light biting sourness that I'm not enjoying, along with a mineralic, bitter tinge. Anyway, it's different, but it's not great.

**Finish**: Medium length, but mild. Metallic. Red apple. Sour malt. Light bitterness, like uncoated tablets.

Odd, not great. I want to say medicinal, but not in the band-aid sense, more in the uncoated tablet type of sense. 

**Summary**: Yeah, not a fan of this. It's thin, it's biting, it's got a bunch off-flavours. I'm really finding it hard to finish this, because it's just too sour and metallic and off.

It does remind me a lot of the Valinch, but I've had that bottle for nearly a year and have yet to finish it, so that's not really high praise. Perhaps (young?) Auchentoshan just isn't my thing.

**Score**: 65/100  
*Bad.*

**Buy Again?** No.

just a suggestion but your little summaries per section of nose/taste etc can all be moved to the end summary pretty easily and nothing is lost.  you repeat yourself a bit and it can be condensed for easier digestion.  


Here's his [Ardbeg recap](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/16k4t8/personal_review_recap_2_ardbegs/).
I like this. Good advice.
I guess that's true, but I kind of like interspersing the tasting notes and the thoughts. 

Each little commentary section is meant to be a summary of what I think of the nose/taste/finish. I may repeat myself a bit too much, but that's more laziness of writing than the format. 

I dunno, will think about it.
Cool. Over a year ago, which is why I probably don't remember it.
did you try any numbers yet?
With the exact same content I like the 2nd formatting better-- it's something I gravitated toward after about a year of being around here. I think it's more a problem of context-switching while reading that can make reading it more difficult. (Not just regarding your reviews, but reviews that have more than one summary in general.)

I've actually noticed that your posts aren't commented on a ton recently too, and I think it boils down to what everyone else is saying-- the unwashed masses don't know what to say about an IB expression from a distillery they've never heard of. There were 21 comments on my HP25 review and 3 comments on my Glenkinchie 20 year CS LE, which I was hoping would generate more discussion.

With those two reviews in mind, I posted them within a few minutes of each other. I think that people will see/comment on one review from one person and kind of feel like they've already messaged that person enough. I generally try to comment on at least one of your reviews as they come in but the volume/timing may be an issue. Also maybe your time zone?

I know that if I post between 4 and 6 Central time, **nobody** comments. People are commuting or eating dinner, and by the time they're back on reddit my post is too old to get any traction. 

yeah, instead now I just list on the bottom of my reviews all the similar malts.  [example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1usvor/laphroaig_25_year_old_cask_strength_2011_edition/)
I did not. Tonight is community reviews. 

I'll start at 1, Saturday at the earliest.
I could have commented on your Glenkinchie review, but I've only had the 12 and wasn't impressed. 

Time zone is a very possible reason. There aren't a whole lot Euro redditors, so non-US timezone stuff will tend to get buried. I'm one of the few people (I'd guess), who mainly looks at the entire whisky network's new posts every day.
I tried to do that for a while, but I had to dig through the archive too many times.
cool!  I'll just say they are all Scotch. 
I've found that the best time to post is Friday between noon and 4 GMT -5.

I had the same reaction to the 12, but the 20 is surprisingly good. Who would have thought that CS, NCF, and uncolored 20yo whisky is better, right? I've got like 10 swap PMs that I've been ignoring due to work constraints, yours being one of them. I'll send you a sample when I finally get to it.
Helps, thanks.
No worries, I've not got much going on."
How'd you get started drinking whisk(e)y?,"I'm working from home today, watching the snow dump on our fair city like it's going out of style.  It's a fine thing to be inside your home on a day like today, especially if your home is full of whisky.  I fee like chatting with folks and learning about how you all got into the water of life, so let's do this.

Me?  Back in December of '12 I was at a friends house for dinner and drinks.  They had a bottle of Templeton Rye sitting out, and I tried it over ice.  Prior to this my whisk(e)y experience had been massive pulls from l.75s of Jim or Jack in college ('cause I'm fuckin' awesome is why).  I've been a craft beer drinker for over 10 years, but had this feeling like I wanted to branch out and try other things.  Wine I tried, and it was OK.  Gin I tried, but I discovered I don't like having things on hand for cocktails (it requires forethought).  Bourbon and Scotch seemed intriguing, but I was intimidated and didn't know where to start.  Which brings us back to my friend's party and the Templeton.  I tried it and liked it.  It wasn't harsh or too strong (thanks, ice!), and I totally got pulled into the marketing department story around that particular rye.  I was *interested*. 

The next day I bought a bottle and enjoyed it over the next month.  First with ice, but then soon after I could drink it neat.  After that I tried another rye, then after that bottle I tried Wild Turkey thinking that I should try some bourbon on for size.  I played around with bourbon for a few months before I discovered /r/bourbon. . .and that about did it for me.  I was hooked.   /r/Scotch soon followed, and after carefully reviewing recommendations I picked up a bottle of Glenfiddich 12.  And the rest is history.  I moved pretty quickly into Islay territory, and that's where my preferences lie today.  I don't drink American whiskey much these days, though I wish I liked that stuff more because it's so much cheaper.  The flavor profiles just aren't to my tastes right now.  Various world whiskies are on my radar starting this year (Amrut!), and of course more scotch offerings!   

It's funny to think back and remember when I used to just buy ONE bottle and wait until it was finished (or nearly so) before picking up another.  Back when I had money in my wallet.  

Part of what has fueled my interest in whisky has been the birth of my children, which sounds funny to say.  I don't mean that they drive me to drink, but whisky is something I can easily enjoy at home in my spare time.  I just don't have the desire to think about beer in the same kind of way that I like to with whisky, so it's way more of a hobby/serious interest.  Beer's what I drink when I'm fixing shit around the house.  Basically, I'm more of a homebody now, and my interest in whisky fits well in my new lifestyle.  

So, that's it.  How about you?

**TL;DR:** whisky is my new hobby now that I have kids, I really only drink scotch, and the Whisky Network is fueling all of this.  ","My wife drove me to whisky. 

I never enjoyed hard liquor after getting sick on it multiple time in my teens. When my wife finished her PhD she brought me a bottle of Laphroaig 10 year to thank me for my support and patience. I said, ""thank you"" like she bought me a ~~New Kids on the Block~~ Bieber lunch pail and carefully put it in a place of honor to gather dust. 

After a few months she opened the bottle and put a dram into my had. It smelled like a moldy locker and cigarettes and tasted like I was licking a rock in a stream. Delicious. I've been reading hooked ever since then. 
I've enjoyed whisky since my college days a decade ago, and drank it often at bars, restaurants, and generally had a bottle or two in the house for occasions, however it was November of 2012 when my I, my wife, and another couple went to Longman & Eagle for dinner and whisky. We finished the dinner off with a glass of Eagle Rare 17 and I was hooked. I picked up a bottle of Balvenie Caribbean Cask 14 for myself, received an HP15 from the same friend, and most importantly, found /r/Scotch. 

I work from home and enjoy whisky, so the community's review focus and my ample free time helped me learn far more about whisky than I think I would have if I'd taken another route. 

Ultimately I got started drinking whisky in college when I'd polish a bottle of JB White every other weekend and then moved up to the ""fancy"" Glenlivet 12. /r/Scotch is where I started caring about *why* liked whisky, and has helped me immensely. 
When I was in college, I did as college students do‚ÄîI took shooters of whatever people handed me.  I did rum shots and vodka shots and jager‚Äîall that shit.  But the first shot I took where I actually thought, ""Hey, that actually tasted pretty good"" was a shot of Jameson.  After that, Jameson was MY drink, and I'd always have it at parties.

Fast forward a few years, I'm a year out of college, have a decent job, and just finished watching 5 seasons of Mad Men, so I decided to start drinking whisky like a man, since I was a grown up now.  Of course, drinking like a man meant sticking my bottle of Jameson 12 on its side in the freezer, but I didn't know any better.  I still enjoyed it though.

So it happens that my boss was a scotch drinker, and being curious about whisky, I asked him what kind of scotch he liked.  He recommended Macallan 12, which was easy enough to find.  When I tasted it, I was blown away by how sweet and amazingly ""smooth"" it was, and especially how different it was than Jameson.  Better even. 

I had to have more.  So I started doing research online.  That's how I discovered Ralfy and his reviews.  He recommended Highland Park 12 as a good starter scotch, so I gave that one a try.  It was way different than Macallan, but just as tasty.  I already had a reddit account at this point, and figured there was a subreddit for everything, so I just typed in reddit.com/r/scotch, and that's how I discovered that.  From there, I bought a 6 pack of glencairns and have since tried at least 40 or so scotches, and gave reviews a shot.  I even delved into bourbon, curious how my home country's spirit compared, and I love it just as much as scotch. 

And we lived [happily](http://i.imgur.com/QJ61cq2.jpg) ever [after](http://i.imgur.com/hWaH8uF.jpg).
Honestly, I didn't like whisky throughout my university days. 

What turned me onto it was when my cousins gifted a .25 litre bottle of Talisker 10 on my birthday around 15 months ago. 

It blew my mind. I drank the entirety of it in a few days, bought another identical bottle, still loved it. Bought a full bottle, still loved it. Then I branched out into Laphroaig 10, Ardbeg 10 and Caol Ila 12. 

Then I found this place, and the rest is history. ScotchSwap let me try a whole assload of new things. 

I love this place, and it's really driven my passion for the hobby. It's great to taste these awesome creations, and I'm glad to have a place to share my experiences.
My father is a whisky drinker and I more or less inherited ny affinity for the drink because of him. I started off mostly mixing with fairly low grade scotch from 18 and then started drinking it straight when I was 20 or so.  

It has only been in the last 3 years or so that I have become picky with what I drink. Back home spirits are taxed up to buggery so it is an incredible indulgence to get a decent drop but with prices fairly low in Japan I have been able to sample much more. Plus I feel I have a semi-unique opportunity to taste the local produce too. 

As for tasting though, /r/scotch has really helped me think a bit more deeply about what I drink. I still can't really detect distinct flavours and name them, but I do enjoy a dram more often than I used to.
.....Mad Men.
Around 10 years ago from my future father-in-law.  Not sure if he accepted me so fast because I was (in my opinion) great to his daughter or because I knew to bring Macallan 12 (his favorite) when I came to visit (cross country sort of thing).
I was born in the great Commonwealth of Kentucky. Our cough syrup was a pint of Bourbon with two boxes of rock candy dumped inside. It was rubbed on my gums as a baby when I was teething. 

""Oh, so you think darkness is your ally? But you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn‚Äôt see the light until I was already a man, by then to me it was only blinding. The shadows betray you because they belong to me.‚Äù
I'm Scottish. I grew up with my old man and his mates drinking whisky on special occasions, it wasn't something they would drink all the time. I would have a sip on occasion and hated it.  
  
When I was 18 I went to a Burns supper with them, drank some really shit Famous Grouse. Got wasted, still hated the taste.  
  
Got to 23, (2 years ago,) moved to Australia - bought a bottle of Dalwhinnie and started slow. Moved on to some Balvenie, Glenfiddichs and Glenmorangie, the standards I suppose.  
  
The last year or so I've been drinking predominantly Laphroig, Lagavulin and Balvenie single barrel, I definitely prefer the smokey ones, particularly the Islay selections.  
  
In March I bought my dad a bottle of Laphroig 25 Year for his retirement. It was older than me at the time. The smoothest, smokiest and most beautiful whisky i've tasted by a long way.  
  
I look forward to tasting many more in years to come.
I hated whiskey until I decided one day that I wanted to develop my taste for it. I went out and bought a couple types of bourbon and blended scotch and drank them slowly whether I liked it or not. All I can say is that it worked. 
I started with JW red, Chivas 12, Knob Creek Single barrel reserve, and Woodford reserve.... So it wasn't too bad
My dad.  He introduced me to a small amount of a Korean blend when I was a junior in high school, I've been hooked since.
Drank Jameo neat here and there, outside of the traditional shots with friends. It took me a trip to Vegas, and mustering up some nuts to order a scotch on the rocks. 

I realize now that I've been in the game for a bit.. That it was probably Dewars white label, which is definitely not my first choice... But none the less, it propelled me onto an adventure that I'm having a blast on! 
Both my grandparents and my mother were regular Johnny Walker Black Label drinkers. When I was fifteen I was given a glass, which I very much enjoyed, so that was my go-to whiskey for a long time, until a few years ago.

I was at a convention, and the hotel had messed up getting my luggage up to my room. Quite a few other people also had issues, so when they gave me some drink tickets, they gave me older ones from the back of the drawer that didn't have a price limit on them. 

A good friend noticed this, and took advantage of this to convince me to get a glass of Macallan 25.

Since then I've been expanding my horizons quite a bit. Still don't know that I have the skills to give a decent review, but I've enjoyed many a good glass of Macallan, Talisker, and Lagavulin (Laga 16 is now my favourite.)
A friend of mine from the air-force days introduced me to whisky ( Chivas Regal of all). And while the first couple of glasses were not really my taste I stuck with it (ah good old peer pressure). 

I actually came soon to the conclusion that I quite loved it and we moved onto single malts soon there after. For years we pretty much had the habit of buying each other whisky for birthdays, the unspoken rule being that it would be a whisky that neither of us has tasted before. 

We've grown apart in the meantime. But the love for whisky remains.
Ahhh that was a great night. Wife and I had just moved back to our home town and were crashing with her parents while we were looking at houses. Then there was a week where my wife and most of her family went out of town for a cousin's wedding, leaving just me, my brother-in-law, and 5 dogs in the house. 

We spent most of the week drinking morgan cokes and playing video games after work. Then we decided one night that we should try classing it up for a night, so we decided to try scotch & cigars. He had smoked a few cigars, but neither of us had ever had scotch, much less knew what ""single malt"", ""blended"", or ""glen-something-or-other"" was. So I spent some of my work day doing as much research as I could, went to the liquor store after work, and picked up a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black and a Glenlivet 12. He picked up Acid Kuba Kubas.

Was a beautiful summer night, so we sat out on the deck, not knowing what to expect- from movies, etc, I was sort of expecting some nasty fire water, but oh- sweet nectar of the gods! We were both hooked at first sip. And now almost 3 years later, I have somewhere around 20 open bottles of whisk(e)y in my cabinet, and I'm very glad that while I still enjoy the occasional cigar, I only acquired one hobby/vice/addiction that night.
Growing up, my parents were wine drinkers. They'd have the odd liqueur, like Sambuca, or my dad would have Rum, but they mainly drank wine while I was young. And the only wine that I liked (and still enjoy) was Ice Wine. And ice wine is expensive to buy for someone who shouldn't be drinking that much anyway (on account of being under 12).

When I was 12, I tried some of my Uncle's Scotch: Famous Grouse. And I didn't mind it after watering it down and putting ice in it.

Didn't really like beer when I tried it, so I stuck to vodka or Canadian whisky during my late teens. The issue was that, when I was 16, I was getting out of shape. And I realized this was because I had really poor eating habits. I ate bags and bags of chips, and a pan of brownies **daily.**

I also drank a lot of coke. So I gave up sweets and pop for a month. And I felt great. However pop no longer tasted right, so I stopped drinking it.

What does this have to do with whisky? Well give me a second. I started having almost immediate hangovers while drinking Whisky and Coke. So I looked for alternatives, and started drinking chilled Russian Vodka, different shots, and Manhattans. Eventually I had a bad night of shots (turns out I can still make [layered shots](http://www.celebrationgeneration.com/BlogPics/LayeredShots0.jpg) while really drunk), so I gave up those.

I really, really started loving Manhattans. And then I ran out of vermouth, so I just drank the whisky straight.

Much later, while out at an Irish bar, my buddies and I decided it was a whisky night. I ordered an Irish Manhattan, as I usually did, and they were out of that specific Irish... but they had Jura Superstition, brand new for them, and would sell it to me cheaper.

I was hooked at the first sip. I hadn't had anything remotely peaty before, and I loved it. So I started drinking Scotch as well, and then started here, and well... as my 10th review states, I won a dram of Balvenie 30. As such, I better start reviewing... so I did.

**TL;DR** Lost weight, couldn't mix because of too much sugar, like the taste of alcohol straight, won a prize, started reviewing.
I love these stories. It's interesting to see how people got in to whisky. I grew up in speyside so for me and everyone I know they grew up with it always there. 
About once a year, I restock the liquor cabinet in my parents' house with bourbon (his) and gin (hers). (They drink more than one bottle per year; I simply use it as an opportunity to gift something they will certainly use.)

I chose Maker's Mark for my dad before knowing much about whiskey, and I liked the story of how they chose the mash bill by sampling various bread receipes. I bought a bottle for myself, enjoyed it, and made whiskey my drink of choice.
In a similar spot with regards to young kid and staying homebound.  I spent years drinking jack and coke, then johnnie red and coke.  On a trip to Monterey I hit up a scotch bar and asked for a recommendation.  Glenmorangie 10.  I loved it. So much in fact I didn't try anything else for a few years.  Finally my cousin and I reconnected.  He was a serious bourbon guy.  Always armed with a glencairn.  I started hosting tastings and buying a lot of single malts and bourbons.  Pretty much became a serious hobby over the last year.  I love picking up new stuff and hosting tastings.  
First whisky with my grandfather at age 4. The real old JW Black, super smooth. Thought it was adult's apple juice and delicious. Just a disclaimer he gave me about a third of a nip, so nothing bad... just in the garden helping him water. His whisky glass in one hand and the other helping me control the hose
I only got into whisky when I was in my early 20s, despite growing up in the highlands. Always offered a wee half/dram (depending on what side of the family) while at family gatherings from about 16, but always tasted horrible. Then just one day about 22, had a Talisker with a friend and suddenly went, mmm this is pretty good, since then I've tried a good few, a mate who worked at the whisky shop and having a distillery in my village helps, and can happily say I'm now keeping my ancestors happy as whisky is my preferred tipple of an evening.
Brand-new whiskey drinker here.

Initially, my interest was piqued by TV shows several years ago. I had some sips of Jim Beam and I think one sip of Wild Turkey, and that pretty much ended my interest.

Several years later, in 2010, I met my friend Theo Wujick (founding father in the Tampa art scene). He was always sipping an old-fashioned at our local hang-out (which I remembered from Mad Men), and he bought me one.

Dear god, it was disgusting.

Now, I enjoy a nice strong spirit. In fact, I enjoy a fantastic vodka, I have a great nose for wines, and am now certainly a beer snob. I am a chef, so have a palette.

But that was some pretty nasty stuff. Wild Turkey? Mad dog? I have no idea what they made it out of.

In fact, I was pretty certain turpentine was one of the main ingredients.

Years later, actually, just last Friday, Theo had passed, and myself and other friends assembled at the club as a memorial. Remembering that his drink of choice was an old-fashioned, I promptly ordered those all night.

Because it was Theo's memorial, I think they used a slightly better whiskey (and I had one bourbon, one rye, don't recall the brands). They were... tolerable. Not terrible.

Then, I went upstairs and saw my favorite bartender, Tia.

As an aside, this club opened twenty years ago. When they opened up the ruined shell that used to be a cigar bar, I'm pretty sure this bartender came with the building.

There is literally no concoction known to man or beast she hasn't heard of or made at least a hundred times. 

She'll even make things up which probably should be written down, because no one else will ever make them. And they are darn tasty.

So, when she makes a drink, you *watch*. 

And her old-fashioned didn't disappoint. Sugar, bitters, water splash, muddle, ice, whiskey (Van Winkle, stored in the back of her bar area), add orange peel.

And let me tell you, that one drink had me hooked.
I often think about what my whisky interest would be like if I hadn't discovered the Whisky Network.  Most of my friends aren't really into this stuff, so I'd probably have tried far less.  

What's the nature of your work that allows you to be at home?  If you don't mind me asking.  
Oh man, I forgot to mention Ralfy.  His reviews were super helpful for me even before I discovered /r/scotch and the like.  Don't remember how I stumbled across him, but I must have been searching for reviews of whatever early scotch I was drinking.  

I was the same way when I first discovered /r/bourbon and /r/scotch, I did a search figuring there must be something.
/r/ScotchSwap was integral! I love getting to try so many awesome new things, especially since the mini situation in the US is so dismal. 
ScotchSwap is something I haven't yet participated in, mostly because I'm lazy.  One of these days I'll order some Boston Rounds. . .
I'll go ahead and ditto your comment about enjoying this place--the entire WN--and I can say that these are some of the most tightly run and enjoyable subs (that I know of) on Reddit.  I have entirely too much fun around here.  

My appreciation for whisky is soaring, and my knowledge increases every day.  
I like to think that in the future my girls will inherit an appreciation for whisky from me.  Maybe that's because my wife hates the stuff, and it'd be fun to have someone around to drink with. . .

**NO PRESSURE, GIRLS!** 
But they only drink Canadian Club...and half the time they drink straight vodka.
That'll do it.  
If either of my daughters ever do get serious with someone, I hope that someone has sense enough to bring me a bottle of scotch.  
I think I'm afraid of you.  

But seriously, I'll bet growing up in Kentucky exposed you to a lot of bourbon.   
Sounds painful.
I started off with a fondness of Jack and a fondness of whiskey sours (so cheap Canadian blends)  I wish I could have had better tastes growing up.  
Good call on the older tickets!  Talisker 10 is quite tasty.  I didn't think Macallan 18 was anything special.  But I know that's probably sacrilege. 
> And then I ran out of vermouth, so I just drank the whisky straight.

That's why I don't drink cocktails or highballs or any of that stuff--I don't want all the bother of making sure I have specific things on hand for different drinks.  Whisky neat is just so *easy*.  


I'd probably still be guessing blindly at what sounds good on a menu and not knowing why I liked it without the Whisky Network. I was bored over Christmas and decided to post my first reviews, and it was all downhill from there.

I'm a software/database/project management/development consultant. I've got a few great clients that I've worked with for years and pick up others here and there when I have time. I've been in the business for 10 years and working from home for 4 of them.
No doubt the biggest influence on my whiskey journey was youtube (Ralfy), blogs, and this website.  

If the whiskey internet didn't exist, who knows what I'd be drinking... 
Yeah, discovering Ralfy was huge.  A lot of the initial bottles I bought were off of his reviews.
Canadian Club is for Don and he does have a one off Crown Royal,  Stolichnaya & Smirnoff interchangeably for Roger, Tanqueray for Price,  Jamesons is a favorite of Peggy and Chivas Regal is Campbell's go to.
I thought I'd have a little fun. Honestly I fell away from bourbon and drank cheap vodka and Jameson through my high school and college years. After college I got into the craft beer movement and also some fine Germans. A couple of years ago at my sisters request I made an old family recipe for bourbon balls. It called for WT101 and I drank a little while I was making the balls. It was an epiphany. I think I had to be older and having a screaming baby also helps you get into hard booze. 25 bottles later I still really enjoy it and it makes me feel connected to my past because my great great grandfather was a legal distiller before prohibition and a shiner during prohibition. 
Those epiphanies are amazing when they happen (or when you pay attention and notice them).You still drink craft beer?  Like anything in particular?

My great-grandmother was a bootlegger up in North Dakota (close to the Canadian boarder)--apparently, she was a Whisky Bitch like no other.
I don't really get into it anymore. I still drink German beers from time to time mostly Erdinger. My go to beer though is probably Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale. It's got a nice flavor and isn't too hoppy and it's also pretty light so I can drink a few and not feel like I just ate a 20 oz ribeye. 
Ah Erdinger.  I studied for a semester in Ireland back in college, and Erdinger was a goto beer for me when I was doing work at home.  I loved the Irish beers, but I was really really into Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel.  Dat beer.  

Note to self: find some Erdinger this weekend.  
I probably like the hefeweizen the best. It kind of tastes like fruit loops but in a good way. "
How long did it take you to come around to peat?,"I've been drinking whisky for a long time and really got into it about a year and a half ago. I tried some peated stuff and really didn't enjoy it. I bought a bottle of Oogie for the community review and wound up giving it away, because while I recognized that it was extremely well-crafted, I just didn't like the flavor profile.

I've recently been reading reviews of some peaty drams and they're really enticing. /u/Loweel invited me over to his home yesterday to enjoy some fantastic whiskies. Toward the end of our mini tastings he poured some High West Campfire-- a blend of rye, bourbon, and a peated Scotch. I was apprehensive but I'm really willing to try anything, and man was I surprised! The fiery smoke and earthy notes that I've previously nearly wretched at the thought of were still there but this time I enjoyed them! We capped the evening off with a Lagavulin 16, another malt that I've never bothered sampling for fear that I wouldn't enjoy it, and again I was blown away. Before pouring, he described it as smoked/roasted honey, and that was dead-on.

So, much like cask strength whisky, which a year ago I struggled with, I seem to now be able to appreciated some peat as well. 

How long did it take you to begin to appreciate smoky, peaty malts? I know a lot of people love them at first sip but I don't hear too much about people that disliked them and then came around.","About 2 minutes. 

I'd tried Johnnie Walker, Glenfiddich and Glenlivet early on, but never liked it. Then I got a bottle of Talisker 10 for my birthday a year ago.

I fucking loved it. The rest is history. 
I was pretty uneducated before my first tasting, but during that tasting we got to taste the Highland Park 12. It was my favorite dram there (more so than the Laphroig). So I guess I always liked some peat, but not near the amounts as I do today. I really started to come around when I tasted the Ardberg 10. That whiskey is amazing.

And speaking of peat and cask strength, I had the opportunity today to taste the Bruichladdich Octomore 6.1. 167ppm (compared with Ardberg's measly 50ppm) and about 57%ABV. Worth a try. Not as overpowering as I thought
Love at first sip, for me. Then I took a hiatus from drinking for a month or so, and now I'm having a tough time getting back into it - had a glass of Lagavulin that tasted like an ashtray. I'm sure I'll come back around eventually though.

Never.  Although I thought I had an epiphany about peat at some point in time after trying Ardbeg's Corryvreckan, which I really loved.  I went back to Ardbeg 10, and Talisker 10 after and still didn't enjoy them.  

Not sure what it was about Corryvreckan, there was just some underlying fruit that came up between the peat, something that just doesn't happen with Talisker or Ardbeg 10, on my tongue.  I'm open to trying more though.  I'm determined to try a Lagavulin at a bar, the price is usually right.

It's worth noting that every review I've read about Campfire mentions how little smoke there is in there.  
I've never been a fan of peaty whiskys and I can't stand Laphroaig but I'll keep trying ones I've not tried before. I just drink what I like.
Started with Laphroaig 10 and loved it. Branching out from that starting point has been easy. :D
About halfway through my first dram of Ardbeg 10
The clock is still ticking
Still haven't come around.  I can appreciate a Scotch with a touch of peat (and even like it!) but heavily peated stuff just repulses me.
About as long as it took me to open up any try the first peated whisky I bought, Laphroaig Cairdeas Portwood. Blew my mind.
First sip and I was in love. 
Love at first sight.
I had tried several different whiskies, but never liked them (the major descriptor I used was perfume-y.) 
then I got to try a Laphroaig, and have been a fan of whisky since. These days I can also enjoy the non peated ones. 
Whilst working at a country pub for some months over Summer. They had a pretty respectable collection of single malts and I was beginning to get into whiskeys and appreciating the nuances of different whiskeys. I always thought I didn't really have a thing for peaty whiskeys and for the life of me, I can't even remember why. 

Anyway, after my last shift, I figured I'd sample a couple with the regulars, Macallan 10, Glenrothes... and then, after asking the regular malt drinker his favourite earlier on, I tried some Lagavulin 16. It blew my head clean off but in the best way and since then, all I've wanted to try are the peatier malts. It also taught me that single malts come in a variety of ABV's too and this has just as much an effect on the taste too.

Anyway, since then I've just been incredibly eager to sample everything the world of whiskey has to offer.

I had been drinking scotch for about 6 months, had maybe a half dozen different things under my belt before trying Ardbeg 10 and instantly loving it.

Then I got Laphroaig 10 and I was very put off.  It has a really strong iodine punch at first I didn't care for at all.  After the bottle sit for a month it was fine and enjoyable though.
What bottle is peaty, but not medicinally?   
I feel like Talisker is what really makes people fall down the hole of scotch. It wasn't until trying some myself that I really got into trying to pick apart whisky. 
Nice. I'm just glad that my palate seems to be coming around, as there are some really awesome-sounding whiskies that up until now I haven't wanted to bother trying.
I don't think I'm quite ready for an Octomore, but perhaps in time!

I've always been a fan of Highland Park. Not the 12 so much, and the 15 is just okay, but the 18 is always in my bar. I enjoy the sherry influence with a slight amount of ash/smoke.
That's a bummer. I know that on an off day my favorite drams taste like vomit-inducing solvent. Sometimes it's just not a day to drink haha.
I've found that it tends to by cyclic. Especially peat seems to be something which you'll be all about for a little while, and then back off on for a bit.
Having read a lot of your reviews, you and I have a very similar palate. Give the Laga a try. I'm no peat head convert or anything, but I was glad to find something that I really enjoyed.
Highland Park's expressions, Lagavulin 16. I haven't had many but I didn't find any medicinal notes in those.
Ha.... Talisker is Morpheus giving you the chance to either take the blue pill or the red bill.  


Octomore actually tastes less peaty than Ardbeg 10, for example.

I don't know why, it just does. 
I enjoy Highland Park and Lagavulin. Probably my favorites. Looking to try others... but my SO thinks i smell like a hospital when I'm on Talisker 10 or Laphroig... 
That's... bizarre.
I agree with this. I think maybe the cask strength has something to do with it, or maybe just the type of peat used."
Can anyone point me to a decent grain whisky?,So I'm trying to expand my taste. I'm curious about grain whisky. The only way I've had them before were through blends. I know there are single grain whiskys out there. I've seen some reviews here but I remember them being the old grain whiskys. Can anyone point me to an affordable yet decent single grain whisky? Maybe around the $30-$60 range?,"Maybe check out http://www.masterofmalt.com/style/grain-whisky/ to get a sense of range and price. 
Well I'd recommend the Cameronbridge 1995 / 2012 or the Cameron Brig. Both cost around $30. 

I would recommend the Cameron Brig. It is a good single grain whisky to start with.
The Nikka Coffey is absolutely fantastic.   I think you'll find it for about $60.  My favorite new drink these days.

"As you continue to gain whisky tasting experience, do you revise your review scores?","Hey, guys. Here's a question that's been on my mind for a while now. I find that the majority of the whiskies I've reviewed thus far fall into an overall score range from 80-90. While that's probably not too uncommon, I also notice that as I try more stuff out there, I feel like some of these scores should be lower and others higher than their original score by comparison. 

That is, with experience, my standard of an ""88 score"" is different now than it used to be and some ""old standard"" 88s should really be 90s and 91s while others should now be 85s and 86s.

The answer for some of these whiskies is a re-review and I'm all for that, but for whiskies where I only had a single sample, I may not get that chance again. 

What do you think, Whiskyit? Do you retroactively change your scores when you get more reviews under your belt or is it best to just leave the scores as they are?","I have never changed a score, but I am spacing them out differently going forward now.  I use the full 1-100 now that I know what I know.  

an archived review is just your overall feelings at that point in time, thats why we include a date.  if you keep your own list, i see no problem adjusting whatever you want.  
I just re review whiskys. I've re reviewed the first few whiskys that I reviewed when I was a noob here. 
I do not believe I will ever change a score. 

I may re-review and have an updated post with a different score but never mess with my original impression.

As for ones you may never try again? That is what you tasted then and what you felt it was then. I think it acts as a good time-capsule for your palate and knowledge. 

Maybe someday I will get the chance to review more Whisky and help you further this research.
Unsurprisingly, no ;) but I do alter my scores sometimes to conform to the Scotchit/American 80-90 heavy bias just to avoid confusion. 

After tasting a lot of drams I guess people can move towards rarer or more unusual stuff/they tend to lean towards drams they know they'll like - so maybe that can bump up scores too. I'm trying to maintain reviewing bottom level stuff too to keep perspective and get a better comparison. 
I mean, I wish I could. 

My plan is that I'll do a re-review pass when I hit 100. Just common drams like Talisker 10, Laphroaig QC/10, Caol Ila 12, Balvenie DW, Glenfiddich 12, Glenlivet 12, etc., just to re-establish a base line.
I haven't, but I would.  Instead of going back and adjusting previous scores I'll probably just re-review eventually and give it a new, more experienced/adjusted score.
I have, but never really ""significantly,"" and mostly because I'm fairly open about the fact that I think scoring (and especially my scoring) is fairly arbitrary in the first place--it's very impressionistic, and my sense is that on any given day, the same whisky could probably score 3-5 points higher or 3-5 points lower.

Right now, for example, while I'm particularly stressed about school, basically *everything* tastes awesome. But that's relative, because any time I take a break for a drink, it's just so, so much better than the hell of my exam writing that of course it tastes awesome.
No, the only thing I've implemented is seperating blend scores from single malt scores. I stole that from Ralfy of course. I just can't compare a blend to a single malt and score the blend fairly.
Hurray! Been an advocate of 1-100 since the beginning 
Just a point in time and experience, I completely agree. 
The one in particular that I'm positive I scored too low is The Balvenie Tun 1401 Batch 3. I gave it a 95 but I really think I should have given it a 97. I won't get a chance to try that one ever again but I'm absolutely positive that 97 is the right score.
Yeah, I plan on doing the same. I'm more worried about samples I won't get a chance to try again.
Hurray!
Beer. "
Whisky through a Cold,"I am on the tail end of a week long cold, and it has been a bad one.  I've been using all the standard OTC palliatives but few things help clear a throat, for a little while anyways, like a little whisky.

With my altered sense of taste and smell though, I have experienced something interesting in the flavor profiles.  I was just using the small bottle of Jamesons I bought for the past review, but realized rather woody and a little plastic, but most of the other notes were gone.

I grabbed my Glenfiddich 12 which for me is very fruity in general and bursting of green apple.  Well, with this cold, it almost tasted like their 18 with smoke.  Yeah, full of old wood and bbq smoke.  Glenmorangie Artein which is very robust with that Tuscan wine finish wound up being a little fishy with the typical Glenmorangie ""sweet cardboard"" finish, although not as sweet.

Buffalo Trace White Dog Mash #1, which I don't care for already, turned into this rubbing alcohol and vomit aftertaste combo.

To mix it up a little, I moved to a gin, Beefeater 24.  All the subtle aromatic notes were gone and it was just juniper, like drinking a bottle of Pine-Sol.  Same for Bombay Sapphie and Bruichladdich Botanist.

Back to whisky, I felt bold and masochistic so I ventured into peated waters.  Highland Park 12, smelled like a freshly opened can of tennis balls, yeah, gross.  Tasted like it too with the addition of the band-aid.  I reversed course and didn't even glance at the Talisker, Lagavulin and Caol Ila I keep on the shelf of shame.

Okay, the Southern Comfort from the joke posts the other day, actually tastes better than when clear.  Some of that peach that I couldn't detect while well somehow cut through and the cough syrup qualities weren't really there anymore.  Of course, I've had so much real cough syrup in the past few days that my brain may be thankful for the change.

The ghost of old Elmer T. Lee called to me and a nip of that brought some nasty sun tan lotion/fake coconut notes along with the corn edge that I don't particularly care for.

As we health improved, my judgement did not, and I decided that I should see what my favorite tasted like.  The Glenmorange Astar was incredibly hot and peppery.  I know a lot of that heat came from the high proof.  There seemed to actually be a hint of band-aid in there.  It tasted absolutely nothing like what I am used to.  Despite knowing why, I feel violated and betrayed.

So, I have defaulted back to the Jameson because nothing else I tried actually tastes delicious with my compromised senses and it is doing the job.  On the plus side, it goes great with Country Peach hot tea.","Yeah, I had a cold and tried a Laphroaig Quarter Cask for the community review. 

It was awful. First time ever it tasted bad. I didn't drink whisky until I wasn't sick, though.
When I have a cold, I don't take chances with good whisky.  Hot Toddies with Evan Williams, Chai Tea, and Honey taste good and make me feel a little better.
Well your nose does a lot more for your taste buds that we give them credit for. If you plug your nose, a bite of a raw potato will taste the same as a bite of a raw apple. Your whole palate probably has changed because of this. Sorry for such a nerdy response. But once your sinus problem clears up keep enjoying whiskey!"
What are your thoughts on 'complexity' and how does it affect your opinion/score of a whisky?,"This discussion is brought on by some thoughts I've had before, and by /u/TOModera's review of [Longrow 18](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1m3ml2/longrow_18_reviewrequest/cc5gsq6?context=3).

I don't necessarily view 'complexity' as a great attribute of a whisky.  I think it *can* be a good thing if the flavors are pronounced and have an interesting evolution.  I think that some people (and I don't mean you, TOModera) view complexity as the sign of a great whisky and if a whisky is not complex they view it negatively.  Hell, some of my favorite whiskies are far from complex, but the tastes that they do have are phenomenal and I would take them any day over some of the more complex whiskies.

So, I ask you - citizens or /r/whisky, what are your thoughts and opinions on complexity? ","I've separated in the past a distinction between a dram which has depth, with complementing and subtle interacting flavours and one which can be a little ""schizophrenic"" with a lot of flavours jostling for prominence. For me, the former adds something favourable and I think it is an attribute of great whisky. 
 
However, I've equally had some very straightforward and simple whiskies which have nevertheless been very enjoyable. For my money though I like it when a bottle can give you a new appreciation, seemingly, with each pour. I got a lot of mileage out of some whiskies because of their layered complexity which gave me more notes with each tasting. I actually get this more often on the nose. 
If the complexity involves a bunch of flavors intermingling and creating a harmony then great.  But if a whisky is complex because it tastes like a burnt band-aid, asphalt, bananas, grass, floral honey, apples, smoked fish, tobacco, rubber, caramel, sherried fruits and ocean air....that's not a drink, that's a burnt down seaside grocery store.
I dunno, I'm throwing in a vote for complexity. 

Most of the worst drams I've had have single mindedly pursued one thing, like ""sweet"", ""smooth"", ""peat"", etc. It's why I find Ardbeg 10 to be a really boring dram, for example. 

I think whiskies that are more flavourful tend to have more complexity because they didn't cut corners. A first-fill sherry cask imparts lots of sherry flavour, age gives wood notes, non-chillfiltration leaves the good stuff in, cask strength lets you actually taste them. 

There's so many elements that give a whisky its flavour, that I can't imagine a well-made whisky that didn't have a degree of complexity.

Of course, there's just muddled as well, and it's sometimes hard to tell the two apart. I think the defining factor is balance - if there's lots of flavours that work well with each other, then it's probably a good whisky.
It certainly isn't a great indicator of quality. But if I am sitting down to specifically enjoy a single dram. I would appreciate it being *good* and *complex*. One that takes a bit of work to enjoy and pick apart.

If I am just looking to drink something tasty and have a few, I would just opt for something simpler.
I think there's a time and a place for both complex whiskies, which may take an hour or more of ponderous tasting and enjoyment; and so called simple whiskies, which are easy to drink and dependable.  

Sometimes I want to lose myself in a complex, multifaceted drink and other times I want more immediate satisfaction from a whisky which is much more accessible. That's the beauty of malt whisky though - the choice is yours.
Certain complexity, like the rivaling wine-cask finishes in Tun 1401, I despise; the product is unmarried, and is sort of like mixing whatever leftovers you had in your fridge.

When it's done right, though, it's sublime (Ardbeg Uigeadail).
Complexity is not an indication of quality, just correlates with it. More flavorful whiskies just happen to be more complex, usually. My only opinion/score of a whiskey is on quality. 
Complexity by itself doesn't necessarily help, it depends on how coherent the flavors are.  

A simple whiskey that tastes like a well mingled whole is better than a more complex whiskey that tastes like an unhinged glass of disparate flavors.  

However, a complex, well-mingled, coherent whiskey will beat out an equally balanced simpler whiskey.  Those complex whiskeys are wonderful to drink, but sort of a pain to review, since it's so hard to pick out so many different intermingled flavors.
complexity is a bonus.  good whisky comes in all varieties. 
I hate Ardbeg 10 because the peat is so offensively prominent that I don't get a damn thing else. I much prefer the subtleties and complexities of something like Bunnahabhain, Lagavulin, Caol Ila, and/or Talisker. I really think complexity is an important thing. Even the cask strength killers such as Uigeadail, A'bunadh, Macallan CS, QC, etc. are nice because they're powerful heavy hitters but in more areas than one. 

As others have said, though, complex flavors need proper balancing. So many balance is still the key factor here. 
To me, flavor is more important than anything else. One dimensional is fine as long as that one dimension appeals to my taste buds.
I'm sorry to peat lovers, but a dram single mindedly pursuing ""peat"" sounds like the worst thing ever.
Whoa, using the word correlation correctly and accurately. Excellent work, rare to see. 

I agree,  high end nosh usually has conplexity. However,  I have had excellent stuff that is extremely simple. I find no real comparison. 
It's more that there's nothing else to balance it out. Even Octomores, that boast about their heaviest peat levels in the world, have lots of other winey notes behind them."
PSA: Whisk(e)y and debt,"I wanted to bring up something that may not necessarily be an issue for those of us in the reddit whisky network, but considering the cost of whisk(e)y it wouldn't be surprising if it was: debt. 

Whisky ain't cheap! Those of us who have delved into this hobby, regardless of our salaries have probably already realized this. And considering how fine small sips of a good bourbon, scotch, or other whisky can be, it thankfully isn't *too* bad. I mean, we're not pounding Pappy Van Winkle and Coca-Cola down one after another like it's Greek Week, so I'd like to think we make our hobby *last*. 

Still . . . one often asked question (at least as far as I can tell for the time I've been around here) is what are good budget, or at least good value, whiskies. People are money-conscious when it comes to this spirit. 

And sometimes, when you look around at reviews, bottle porn, search deals and sales at stores and online, there's this creeping necessity to ""keep up with the Joneses."" I'm speaking about myself just as much as anyone else, so I just wanted to give a friendly reminder that as *wonderful* as whisky is, it's not worth getting into debt over, defaulting on student loans, missing mortgage payments, etc., etc. It's just not. It's a hobby; a fun hobby, but still just a hobby. When you're drooling over bottle porn, find a way to remind yourself that you need to keep it within a ""whisky budget"" and don't go over it. If, because of your situation, your whisky budget is--    *ahem* --plentiful, then by all means, have at it. But don't let the desire get the best of you. 

For me personally, some of the best things that have come from this hobby have been the pure experiences (peat, for example, is something that I never would have tasted if I never got into this) and the people I share and discuss drinks with. It's the connections we make that count, not the collections we hoard and lord over each other.

Then again . . . there's always [**this**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OCAkRkAHTk), so take it or leave it. 

Cheers!","I don't mind keeping up with the Joneses as long as I don't have to keep up with UncleTobys
No question.  That is why I focused my hobby on bourbon.  The value I can get out of a $25 bottle is simply amazing, and unfortunately, cannot be found in Scotch.  
Yup. Don't let what you love destroy you
Nicely put!
This is oh so relevant. I urge everyone to check www.cooperedtot.com posts just before he got back in. He was dealing with a lot of problems even on the verge of breaking his family apart because of his whisky habit. Driscoll of KLWines spirit journal also always has elegant thoughts regarding the enjoyment of spirits while keeping your wallet and sanity in check. Great post! 
Im broke and have 9 bottles. Will be looking into bourbon.
Though unfortunately you do not get the variety in bourbon that you get in scotch."
Letting it dry,"I'm a little curious if anyone else likes to let the last few drops of their whisky dry in the bottom of the glass. It started out entirely on accident for me, after a long day at work I wanted a nice pour of whisky, but I got too tired to finish off the last few sips worth and went to bed. When I got up in the morning I noticed that what was left in the bottom of the glass had completely dried out, leaving just a light brown coloring at the bottom of the glass. 

More than anything was the scent though. The smell has become much stronger and easier to pick out some of the scents. Since then I've been doing that frequently when I take notes for reviewing. Not a huge amount, but just enough to coat the bottom of the glass. 

Anyone else do this?","I do this. But only because I am a lazy bastard.
Yes. The alcohol evaporates out and you're left with wonderful aromas. 
I do this every time. By the next morning I find that the aromas that are left are the true essence of the flavor profile and usually one flavor dominates the rest.
Yes.  ....and here I thought it was my little secret.
Sticking my nose in the aftermath of a glass of Bulleit's like sticking my nose in a bag of pipe tobacco. Mmmm...
Same deal, every time it's part of my nosing notes. A forgotten glass of Lagavulin 16 tipped me off to this trick a couple years ago."
It's Friday! A cocktail for the weekend? I think so...,"So it's Friday, and what's my favorite thing to kick off the freedom? A whisky, a cigar, and a book. Now, I *love* my whisky neat, and pairing it with a cigar is usually magical . . . but lately I've found that when I mix whisky with a cigar, I often get the same note in the nose and taste (no matter the whisky, no matter the cigar). It's just grapes, or maybe grape leaves. Doesn't matter if it's Laphroaig, Weller 12, rye whiskey, I just get this grape-ishness out of it. It's not necessarily bad, but I'm starting to smoke and drink at the same time less, at least when it comes to scotch. 

So, /r/whisky, my question is whether or not you all have some good cocktails to share? I figured it's still hot as ballsack in Florida, and a cigar would probably go nicely with a cold cocktail. I would prefer not to use my scotch, though, as I would rather enjoy those neat and only neat . . . still, I do have a few scotch bottles that probably aren't going to get drunk and could be used in a mixed drink. 

For bourbon, this is what I have to use: 

- Bulleit Rye
- W.L. Weller 12
- Wild Turkey 81
- a *tiny* bit left of Wild Turkey 101 mini

For the scotches I'm willing to use in a cocktail: 

- Speyburn Bradan Orach
- Ardbeg 10
- Deanston Virgin Oak
- Ardmore Traditional Cask Peated
- Black Bottle (Islay blend)
- Gallacher & Dunn (blend)

What recipes would you recommend? I suspect it would get trickier if I were to do it with scotch whisky, what will all the different flavors and aromas you could get out of it. 

Thanks!

EDIT: I would prefer something without sugary soda, but I'm still up for any suggestions.","What ingredients do you have on hand?
I am a fan of the whiskey sours my Grandma taught me.

In a small pitcher combine:

 1 can of frozen lemonade concentrate
 
1 can bourbon

1 can water

Serve over ice and garnish with an orange slice



~~I prefer an old-fashioned. http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink407.html~~

~~The muddling is the biggest part.~~

You know what? Use that bulleit and do a sazerac!
I tried a whisky cocktail a week ago. I think it was called Boulevard Dare. I asked the bartender to use Evan Williams Single Barrel for it. He put vermouth, maple syrup and lemon peel. I forgot the rest
Try a Churchill. It's quite delicious
1 1/2 measures Scotch (I'd use the Gallacher)
1/2 measure red vermouth
1/2 measure lime juice
1/2 measure Cointreau /Grand Marnier
shake well with ice
strain into a chilled glass
Whiskey Smash

Muddle Lemon and mint, add 1oz simple syrup and 2oz bourbon or rye, dry shake, strain into a rocks glass, fill with crushed ice
Whatever you do, I'd use the bulleit! Manhattans are my favorite. 
Ice...

but I'm willing to buy things
This sounds really good.
gonna want some egg whites for that sour mix...
I've heard you need to do an absinthe rinse for a sazerac? Don't know if I can do that...haha
I still just need to try Evan SB by itself!
> Boulevard Dare

Sounds like someone made a variant on the Boulevardier.  Equal parts (though I like 3:2:2) of bourbon, sweet vermouth, and Campari.
That sounds interesting. I'm gonna give that a try after I sip a little Highland Park...
Get a nice Vermouth like Carpano Antica Formula and make a manhattan. I use 2oz Rye (or bourbon) and .75oz Vermouth. Or you could get some fresh mint leaves, muddle them with sugar and add bourbon for a mint julep.
Yuck!  Heh, I understand the use of egg whites for certain drinks, but in a whiskey sour?  Really?
Herbsaint
Same here!
Maybe that could be it. I didn't see it in the menu. Maybe I heard the bar tender wrong. :| 
Nice, thanks! I was thinking of going for something with the Bulleit Rye. I'm definitely looking to save money on any vermouth or bitters, though, as I still would like to budget my money toward getting more whisk(e)y. 

Also, maybe I'll make a manhattan (or I guess rob roy) with the Black Bottle, and it could be like a *semi* peat-infused manhattan...
egg whites can really elevate the mouth feel and look of sour mix.  Totally worth it.
If you like a particular cocktail--it's good to invest in some good liqueurs.  I'm a big fan of a Negroni, and DAMN it was worth it to get that Carpano Antica.  The only problem is now I tend to drink more negronis....

However--I had the same problem as you in the liquor store the other day--buy 3 bottles, Buffalo Trace, Plymouth Gin, and .... More Whiskey?  More Gin?  Or that Liqueur I've been meaning to buy but end up turning down for beer or other liquor.
Hmm I'm having trouble getting the carpano antica. It runs a good 3-4x more expensive than cheap vermouth, but i can at least acknowledge that the manhattan I had using this and templeton was far better than what I was mixing at home.

Does vermouth go bad? This is one reason I'm hesitant to splurge on the good stuff.

Ps. I use bulleit rye or rittenhouse 100
Yeah--it does go bad.  You need to keep it in the fridge--it should stay pretty darn good for a while.

But if you're not a fan of the vermouth (you don't use it much), you may as well stick with the lower shelf stuff.  After my bottle is used up (soon), I probably won't splurge again for a while.

You can also buy the smaller .375 bottle.


What drinks did you end up making this weekend?
Ugh I saw the 375ml at a mega-liquor store and passed because it wasn't a great value (maybe 18 bucks) and i was already spending 50 bucks on scotch (glenfarclas 12 if you're wondering). Kinda regretting that I didn't because I've never seen it before.

I've been on vacation staying with family so I didn't have my bitters, rye, or anything really to make a manhattan. Made gin and tonics with Bombay sapphire. It was alright!  All this talk is making me want to make something tonight though.

How long do you think vermouth lasts in the fridge?  I like whisky, how else can I use vermouth other than manhattans?
If you have a wine saver/vacuum, it can last 3-4 months...it is fortified after all.

Other cocktails? Negroni (good with Bombay Sapphire...and if you don't have Campari...GET IT.  I drink it too often.  It's super delicious with just sparkling water after a workout), [Vermouth cocktail](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/01/vermouth-cocktail-recipe.html).........?  I too would like more answers to this question.

It's hard to swallow, but I try to convince myself buying a nice vermouth is like buying a nice bottle of whisk(e)y.  You wouldn't mix a $50 bottle of liquor with a $15 bottle.  Nonetheless the slow deterioration of vermouth is a PITA.

I regularly spring for Noilly Prat...or whatever is on sale.  Like liquor--even middle shelf will be a big improvement.

But hey--have a cheap-ish bottle?  Experiment a little!  Share any great findings."
whats the worst whisky you've ever had?,"for me it was [Kilbeggen Blended Irish](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhiskeyReviews/comments/18qkzy/kilbeggan_blend/).

10/100, tastes like poison.  only whisky i've ever wanted to dump out and not finish.  even scotch in a can was better. ","I dumped /u/Trexid's sample of Passport pretty fast after giving it a fair review, but I think the absolute worst memory I have of any whiskey is Canadian LTD.
Red Label. Still have to find some Crappy Sark sample bottles, Passport Scotch and Scotch in a Can.
As will come to no surprise to anyone that knows me, it is a Laphroaig, specifically the 10 year cask strength.  Pure vileness.  It literally registered as ""poisonous rot"" to my survival instincts.  The more offensive flavors of note that I picked up were moldy sweat sock, concentrated body odor and heavily mildewed bathtub.  Meanwhile my lady friend that was enjoying it looked like she was about to cum in her pants.
Dewar's White.
Black Velvet. I thought Canadians had standards.
For me, it would be Georgia Moon (unaged corn whiskey), but I think there was nothing to be expected there. Johnny Red is actually a close second: most cheap scotch tastes like nothing; Red Label tastes just awful.

PS. I've not had the pleasure of Kilbeggan, but I am almost perversely interested considering it placed behind scotch in a can. I suppose it's best I swore off reviewing Irish and Canadian for the foreseeable future.

I always describe Johnnie Walker Red as the worst imaginable combination of fake honey and grape drink. This sums up my feelings about that ""whisky"".
It's a tie between Buchanan's 12 and Johnnie Walker Red. At least JW Red doesn't just taste like young grain alcohol. That said, I was too generous in my scores for both the should be 0 because they tasye like bile.
Passport ""Scotch"" was vile and gave me a headache instantly after drinking it. The headache lasted all of the next day. I had 1 dram.
/u/Trexid game me a sample of Passport Scotch. This. This is my worst.
Passport Scotch and Johnnie Red. Both are not fit for human consumption. If I ever see someone buying Johnnie Red in a store I'm going to hand them a bottle of Windex instead.
Cutty Sark.  Granted, I was new to whisky at the time, but all I tasted was alcohol and gasoline.
Bruichladdich Rocks, talk about rough!
Famous Grouse and I famously don't get on.
Vat 69. Just can't stand the stuff. Tastes about as good as it costs.
Royal Canadian, Johnny Red, and Lexington Bourbon. 
Rebel Yell

...if you drink too much of it you take on the persona of an angry confederate 
Dewars.
Bells as my old man (an [Aberdonian](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Aberdonian)) calls it ""cooking whisky"". That stuff put me off whisky for several years.
Old Crow or Kessler's
Penderyn; it manages to capture the taste of burning truck tyre almost perfectly, whilst still holding on to lighter notes of vomit and TCP
I've a fondness for Dewar's White Label. It's not a great whisky but I find it inoffensive. Over ice, of course.
Worse yet is their Burnt Caramel offering.
The 8 year is decent.
I thought it was decent--finished off a good bit at a wedding.  Then again, when I first dipped into the bottle, I was pretty damn tipsy already.
dont do it man
Ha! Windex is whisky that I see on a regular basis but I still keep forgetting it exists
if you don't have one already :-)
Lol what? Windex whisky? I meant the Window cleaner stuff sarcastically lol
There's a whisky that starts with w too. Maybe it was windsor or something like that. "
phases of whisky buying,"has your experience been anything like mine or are you currently in a phase that I've been through?

when I started drinking whisky, it was Scotch at first, everything on the liquor store shelf was a mystery and it was exciting to pick something out.  I didnt have the luxury of an /r/scotch to guide me yet (kind of why it has become like it is).  So I probably wasted too much money just randomly buying bottles that I knew very little about.  

I learned a lot from doing this but it cost me.  though I bought a lot of bottles right out of the gate, not many of them were terrible so I dont feel too bad.  It was like freshman year of high school for me.  learn what I liked and then move on from there.

next phase was less gambles and more samples.  I tried not to spend a ton anymore and just get my hands on Master of Malt samples.  by this sophmore phase, I knew I didnt want to blow my money on tons of gamble bottles anymore and I sort of knew what I liked for sure.  certain brands stood out like Laphroaig or Macallan so I wanted to try their ranges.  again, scotchswap wasnt really a thing yet so I had to rely on friends or websites or local stores. I still bought bottles but they were specific to what I already liked for the most part.  

junior phase i moved onto bourbon.  not neglecting Scotch but I took a turn to explore other whiskies in the world.  Bourbon, Rye and other American whiskies are a lot cheaper and once I got used to how different they tasted and found what I liked, its been a pleasure exploring.  I went through a lot of whiskey much like I did in phase 1 with the liquor store shelves.    I know I dont care for Irish or Canadian from experiences so I dont branch out to those guys at all.  I have gotten plenty of samples of each and I know not to waste my money with those guys.  

Senior phase, I know what I like and I'm very picky about buying bottles.  I know my Scotch world, and I know my Bourbon world.  I know my brands/distilleries that I like and I just want to spend some quality time with them from now on.  I called this my Pyramid of Whisky.  Try lots at the bottom and whittle my way up to the select few at the top that I'll always want to keep at my bar. Scotchswap and online retail are the only places I gamble on new whisky.  I do my research and read reviews and compare and contrast all my options before I spend my allowance on a bottle.  

I'm very picky now and I think thats a good thing.  The walls at the liquor store are no longer a mystery and when I look over them I say to myself not to bother with a lot of the whiskies on the shelves because I know better.  If possible I try before buying.  I look for rarer things online from the brands I love.  

how about you guys, did you go through any similar phases, currently in a phase, or what?","Pretty similar. Although I am still a noob with scotch and slowly warming up to peat. 

Initially, I didn't know what I was doing with bourbon and just bought something that seemed interesting. Buying sourced whiskey like an idiot. But slowly I gained more information that now if I walk into a store (or online) and I see something that is a once in a lifetime buy, I go for it and feel no remorse for it. 

Not so much for scotch now. I am kind of phased by the high prices of scotch. As my collection grows to about 10, my selections are carefully picked.  /r/scotch was a huge help with that. I am not sure if I can continue with it though, given how expensive it is. So I am trying to ditch the legacy malts and go for under-priced malts. I recently bought Tomatin 18 and the Decades malt. So far, everything is going better than expected. 

I need to get into rum more. I have not been drinking it as much as I plan. Still waiting for Ron Zacapa to go on fucking sale. It has been year and still no sale. 

Same with brandy. I sort of have the basics down but want to get into it further.

What I do know is that at a very base level, my palate goes for sweet, creamy and spicy notes. Naturally, bourbon is the way to go but a good sherried speyside or highlander, an aged rum, or VSOP cognac can hit those same notes just as well.

I think my last hurdle are earthy notes - specifically peat. Love smoke and really want to get the Balcones Brimstone as a primer before I really buy a true Islay. Still on the fence about Laphroiag QC but I may pull the trigger on Bunahhabain 12 if I ever see it. Every time I get a Laphroiag 10  at the bar, I just wonder, why the hell am I drinking this? Even Highland Park has too much peat for my tastes.
I want to be in the buy and try everything phase but with a two year old and another on the way I just don't have the time nor money.

I have a few Scotches that I like but I still want to try more before settling down in one type (Peat, Sherry, etc). I really do need to get into the Swap though to try more without breaking the bank on purchasing bottle after bottle.

My sister-in-law is big into the Bourbons but we don't see her much so I have few opportunities to try her collection.

I see myself, once I am done with the Masters, the kids are a bit older, getting into more and more. Maybe one day I will have that fancy black tartan next to my name.
I started trying everything.  Started with mixed crap in the bars and at parties and gradually used less mix. I stayed away from shot glasses. I also knew a lot of whisky drinkers so I got a chance to try a great variety. I also learned how to taste properly.  I started going to tastings I've graduated to almost solely neat whisky or a hint of water.  

Now I go to a lot of tastings.  I am a member of a couple whisky clubs. One formal and one just friends.  I also go to a few liquor stores where I'm a known regular and I get to sample almost all before I buy.  (it took a while to get there).  Most importantly I do not look at color or price if I can before I taste it.  I used to be very visually biased towards rich caramel and bronze colors and of course the price was biasing factor.  I don't ask price until after I've tried it now.  This has expanded my experiences and appreciation vastly. I've got $25 bottles I like, I've got very expensive bottles I like.  Just bc it's expensive doesn't mean I like it or it's for me. I also realized that I've changed, my tastes changed so I do go back to things I've had in the past.  I don't write off whiskies as much as I used to. Certain whiskies I found undrinkable I may now find complex and fascinating (the peat magic of Islay is a good example). The other thing I do is I only drink about a half ounce at a time.  I appreciate it more that way. I take my time with it.  I can always have another.  When I go to my usual stores I to get something, I may get a great one I love but I always ask ""Is there anything I should know about on the shelf?""  They've directed me to some great things I never would have looked at initially.

I'm not a whisky novice and I'm not a whisky pro (don't do it for a living), I don't care for the term aficianado, I refer to myself as a well seasoned, adventurous intermediate.
Before I turned 21, I had a few opportunities to try some great Scotch, including a few Macallans and Lagavulin 16. After I turned 21, I figured any cheap scotch I could find would be good enough. I was horribly wrong, and avoided Scotch for over a year, sticking mostly to gin. After visiting the bourbon trail (at that point, still 21) my interest in bourbon grew slightly but I fell in love with rye. I still exlplored other spirits though, and because of my curiosity my collection grew faster than I could drink, slightly. 

About four months ago, age 22.5, I visited Stranahan's Disitillery on vacation inDenver. For the unfamiliar, Stranahan's Colorado Whiskey is a craft single malt, aged in new charred oak and bottled at 3-5 years. Something clicked in me, and I'm not sure why (Stranahan's is good but not mind blowing). When I got back home I was obsessed with whisky (Scotch and American). I discovered Ralfy and watched multiple videos a day. I started looking more closely at the Scotch area at my local liqour store, and then I started going to different liqour stores to see what else they might have.

On my first deliberate drive across town to investigate a new store, I bought a bottle of Old Pulteney--my first single malt purchase since the disasterous McClelland's Islay over a year earlier. I took it home and found that reddit had *just* done a community review of it. 

Since then I've been buying like crazy. I've bought every mini available locally, and I've (twice) driven to the Party Source (about 100 miles away) to buy almost every worthwhile mini they sell.

I'm trying to curtail my purchases, since the rate that I've been purchasing is exponentially greater than the rate at which I drink. Hopefully now I'm entering the phase where I only buy something if it is truly a rare opportunity, like the trio of NCF 46ers I posted about yesterday.
Yep. Once I sampled a huge variety of scotch/bourbon its turned into a very selective buying process. Sort of sad really. I talk to the guy at the liquor store a lot less now.

Interesting to see preferences evolve before your own eyes in the form of reviews though.
I went through a similar phase with beer. In the beginning ... I sampled a lot of stuff, but I reached a point where the gambling was no longer worth it. There's a lot of breweries I still haven't tried, but I get a better return buying the stuff I know I'll like a lot, rather than getting something that, while new, will likely only be pretty good, not great. 

But I've now gotten into whisky and, while I'm still relatively new to it (I think I've sampled 15 different bottles), being in the scotch section of the liquor store use to be like being dropped in the middle of a remote, foreign country with an obscure dialect. Thanks to /r/Scotch, I was able to buy quality whisky and avoid costly mistakes. Now that I am more learned, the scotch section is no longer a confusing place; I may not have sampled every bottle, but I'm at least somewhat familiar with the distilleries. 

I'm starting to enter into something of a sophmore stage; my wallet has taken a hit since I've taken up this expensive hobby and I've got to scale back and stick to samples. I've started to venture into the deeper waters of Bourbon and while I like Bourbon quite a bit, I don't like it as much a Scotch (as of now), but my wallet certainly prefers Bourbon. I feel my Scotch path is going to go in the way of beer path; I'll sample a couple more of the famous distilleries but then I'll pull back and stick to my favorites (Laphroaig, Lagavulin, and Ardbeg). 

Pretty much In phase one with a slight difference. I know now that my favorite whiskies are from Islay, or they're either heavily sherried Speysiders. So I still go and stare at the mighty wall of whisky, but know what to look for.

Now with bourbon that's a whole different story. I spent about 30 minutes just trying to make a decision. In the end I got an Eagle Rare 10 because I liked the bottle and patriotic look of it. I wasn't dissapointed with the contents of the bottle so I lucked out on that one. (:
I'm in the 'holy shit this is exciting, I want to buy everything' stage. fortunately, i have the reviews here to guide me. I'm often in teh liquor store, pulling up the review archive when I see a bottle I'm not familiar with, and select bottles based on teh comments and scoring vs price points. it's led me to buy a healthy bar of single malts, and has allowed me to pick and choose the best, affordable world whiskys. 

i'm moving to a stage where I want to try some rarer/unique/pricier bottles, but don't want to spend money on full bottles of them, so i'm exploring scotch swapping and sample buying right now. 

I'm curious to hear which Canadian whiskys you tried. I've got some really nice limited run bottles at home and would be happy to swap and hopefully  redeem your opinion of Canadian whisky!
My very first bottle was Highland Park 12, I'd been thinking about trying whisky for a while and I watched through numerous Ralfy reviews, HP12 looked like the deal breaker, so I went the shop and bought a bottle, the woman looked at me and said *¬£30 for a bottle, you must be crazy*, I lied and said it was a present for someone, yeah, to myself. And from there, my love for scotch became a thing as the only whisky I'd smelt or tasted was Bells, which was and still is terrible. The smokey note which is left in your mouth after HP12 is what got me hooked, it reminded me of an ash tray, but of nice ash.
Pretty similar. I bought a bottle whenever I could. Except I had scotchit to guide me. I only have bottles since I can't buy samples here or swap (too few scotchiteers here)  I think I'm in the senior phase but I end up going to the Sophomore phase once in a while. I end up going back because the bourbon and world whisky selection here is bad. Plus when I see uncommon bottles I instantly buy them since I might not see them again. 
Finally had some time to respond to this... Might be a little TL;DR but I wanted to put some effort in.

I went through a phase similar to yours directly following the advice of /r/scotch members. I did a TON of research in the archive, documentaries, malt madness, ralfy, texacer's guides and then moved into a heavy exploration / spending phase. I'll break it down just for a bit more clarity.

**Blind Consumer of Whisk(e)y phase:** Jack Daniels Galore (jack & coke), Jameson shots galore. Ocassional bottle of Old Grand Dad. My first Scotch was Johnnie Walker Red in around 2005 new years day, a recommendation from a random bar patron who I think was pissed when I won a $400 pot in liars dice in a fisherman's wharf watering hole. I ended up drinking Johnny Red for the rest of the day, not knowing that it was engine de-greaser. I'll go into my full story on that experience when I get to my Johnnie Red review. My wife bought me my first bottle of single malt (Glenfiddich 12) for Christmas in 2010 the year we got married. A friend drank the whole bottle in one night and replaced it with a bottle of Glenrothes Select Reserve which I enjoyed at the time. Skip 3 years to 2013 which leads to my freshman phase. ;)

**Freshman Phase:** Friend poured me a glass of Macallan 12 on New Years eve 2012 and mind = blown, instantly fell in love with Single Malt Scotch and then a month later I found /r/scotch and the community recommend I pickup a bottle of Macallan 12 to start with. Enjoyed the Mac 12 immensely for about a week and then after research found a bottle of Highland Park 12 and got my first taste of peat mind = blown agani. Continuing tons of research and documentaries and getting tips from members of Scotchit I move into the Sophomore phase.

**Sophomore Phase:** Armed with the review archive, help from Scotchit members and a bit of expensable income I began a huge bottle acquisition campaign. Finlaggan, Laga12, Talisker 10, Laphroaig QC, Bunnahabhain12, etc.. I purchased about 15 bottles of Single Malts and Blends within 3 months. My bank account suffered and my wife expressed some concern. I then decided to stretch my money and try drams in bars for more expansion of my palate. I reviewed my special bottles every 10th or so review and I'm slowly running out of them for those tartan upgrades. Spending money on bottles came to a grinding halt immediately. Still reading /r/scotch daily, nightly, on my phone any down time, I move into the Junior Phase. Also, I joined a new startup group /r/bottlesplitters which is a monthly subscription to be apart of a US based group of splitters, allowing me to try some expensive stuff without the financial burden all on my own.

**Junior Phase:** With my budget for $80 - $150 bottles of Scotch drained my discovery of /r/bourbon at the recommendation of /u/hailchaos and /u/texacer came at a perfect time. I picked up some introductory bourbons. Four Roses Small Batch for the CR, Buffalo Trace, WL Weller 12, Weller 107 and Jim Beam Black and an array of Bourbon samples I've yet to review. Bourbon is much more affordable and damn good stuff I can enjoy without the guilt of emptying my single malts. This leads into a full adoration of /r/scotchswap where I discover I can trade 2oz samples of my bottles for others samples. Tons of trading ensues which allowed me to get a wide range of samples at the cost of empty bottles, shipping and a little friendly negotiating with the fine members of the community. Leading into my senior phase, if you want to call it that. I still feel like I'm setting my roots as I've only been a member of /r/scotch since March of this year but definitely appreciate how awesome the community is.

**Senior Phase:** Solely relying on /r/scotchswap with the occasional bottle purchase after a lot of deliberation. Rares, discontinues, awesome sales are the exception here. I've got an awesome cache of samples and still receive my monthly package of samples from /r/bottlesplitters with the occasional full bottle split among members. I'm now very selective about where my money goes and I've got a handle on what regions / styles / malts / bourbons / ryes I really enjoy and feel comfortable with my purchases. Currently enjoying working my way through samples and still learning quite about about Single Malt. Bourbon has taken a back seat for now while I go full steam ahead into Scotch, I feel like I'll need to dedicate a lot of the same time into Bourbon research like I did witch Scotch to fully appreciate it.

**Summary:** Keeping my spending under control, getting samples over full bottles, enjoying the ride, the whisky and the community here on the Reddit whisky network. I feel like I'm in hyperbaric whisky chamber sometimes, looking at my shelf of samples finding it hard to pick one out sometimes. /r/firstworldproblems

I have enjoyed every new bottle of scotch. I guess i'm on phase 1!
I'm with you on the rum front. I'm increasingly blown away by what rum makers can do, and the price that they can do it at. My most recent purchase--Appleton 12--was five dollars less than basically even the cheapest single malt I'd be willing to buy and blows Scotches two-three times the price absolutely out of the water.
peat isnt for everyone OR its an acquired taste.  dont push it just because its popular.  Bunnahabhain is more sherried than peaty, you should like it.

rum, I still love Zaya and Roaring Dan.  Ron Z is ...okay
Zacapa 23 is fantastic, though it didn't steer me away from whisky as my preferred spirit. I got a sample at the Party Source, where it was cheaper by the mL than the full-size bottle.
I hear you with the little ones, I have two myself and they take up a lot of resource :)
nice.  I completely agree about pricing.  I used to factor that into reviewing but its not really a fair thing to do I've found.  I wouldn't call myself a pro either, just an Enthusiast. 
McClellands... no wonder!
its true, I do feel a tad sad but also glad because I know whats what.  I can focus better on quality. 
""you're welcome"" -  /r/scotch
need any other bourbon recommendations?

I'm glad the Reddit setup is working for you, I just wish it had been around for me!
that lady be crazy
you zipped through fast. 
I feel like I'm probably in the Junior/Senior phase, but I'd really like to buy more. I went on Master of Malt today (well, just now) and loaded a cart full of everything I'd want: Talisker 18, Springbank 12, Caol Ila CS, Kilchoman Loch Gorm, Balvenie 15, some indie Islays. 

Then the price looked a bit painful considering my recent Scotland trip so I closed it and felt a tinge of regret.

Maybe when I hit 50 reviews I'll be ready to spend a bit more. I was also sad that I failed to buy an Ardbog when it was available the week before my trip (thinking it would still be around a week later), and found that it was sold out now. Sad.

Freshman Phase: Friend poured me a glass of Macallan 12 on New Years eve 2012 and mind = blown, instantly fell in love with Single Malt Scotch and then a month later I found /r/scotch and the community recommend I pickup a bottle of Macallan 12 to start with. Enjoyed the Mac 12 immensely for about a week and then after research found a bottle of Highland Park 12 and got my first taste of peat mind = blown again""

Haha....
Appleton 12 is the real deal. We need to be friends.
It annoys me greatly to go to tastings and meeting some well heeled folk who brag about buying really expensive whisky, like this guy and his wife talked up their ounce of Glenfiddich 50.  All they do is show up and buy the most expensive speysides and that's it. There is nothing more to many than X is more expensive than Y therefore it is better. It's one thing I really enjoy about SMWS, you get the mystery back. I also love getting people into blind tastings.  It weeds out the bullshit artists and you get to talk about the flavors and what you like.  I love the surprises, love finding something new, love going back to old friends.  

As for an Enthusiast, you definitely are.  I've read many of your reviews and you are definitely above the line for the average whisky drinker but still human all the same.

Anyway, I'm off shortly to do some whisky sampling my self.  I've got a Signature Series Inchmurrin and a Coal Isla Distillery Edition to open along with my newest SMWS addition while grilling dinner tonight with a couple friends.
Yes please! (:
your assessments of the Forty Creek reserve expressions as best Canada has to offer are definitely on the mark. the only one of theirs I don't have at home isthe Port Wood reserve. definitely need to get some to try soon!

you should try to get your hands on teh Lot 40. it's a very young whisky and you can tell... it tastes.. immature is the best word I can come up with... still a nice unique flavour profile though. I""ll be posting a review of it soon.
you know someone is a poser when they just love price.  I'm glad I started the Mystery Dram on scotchswap, it really opens people's eyes.
Eagle Rare is the only one you've had so far?  what are top scotch whiskies?
I can't waste anymore time or money on Canadian until they really start getting their shit together
I've had Jack Daniels Old No. 7 but that tasted like Sugared water to me.

My favorites of the few I've had so far; Laphroaig 10 and Highland Park CS. I do enjoy a heavy sherried Speyside too though...
pick up some Old Grand Dad 100 BIB for your Highland Park interest

and some Old Weller 107 for your sherry interest.  report back. 
Thank you for the suggestions! Will do!"
just a random thought,Last night I ended up scratching a wound and made it bled again. As most guys do I taste my blood. It hit me that the taste of blood reminds me of peated whiskys. So I wonder how most reviews don't have the tasting note of blood.,"NOPE
You've done it! You've become a Scotch super hero. Instead of blood coursing through your veins you've got peated single malt!

**Lagavulin 12 (not really)**

- nose: peat, smoke, blood
- taste: peat, my own blood
- finish: sookie stackhouse

OMG THEIRS PEAT IN MY BLOOD, MUST CUT WRIST TO SAMPLE AND REVIEW IMMEDIATELY!

please post a review of your blood gaxkang :D

update: Now I'm thinking of vampires posting reviews of blood they've tried.. I just finished watching S06E04 of True Blood.
When I lived in the dorms my freshman year of college, a kid down the hall cut his arm (intentionally) and mixed the blood into a shot of vodka. Don't be that guy.
I wouldn't be surprised if someone who ate a lot of blood sausage, blood pudding or coagulated blood would include that in a review. I don't eat these things, though.
wat
Lol. Not entirely! Just this phenol like, iodine and iron taste. @.@
Honestly blood pudding/sausage really doesn't taste all that ""bloody"" to me.  
We eat something here called ""dinuguan"" which is mainly pig's blood and some innards 
Oh I definitely get Iron, Salt and Iodine in my blood
Yum."
Is your opened bottle burning a hole in your proverbial pocket?,"I'm still quite new to fine whisky drinking. In the past year I've collected a pretty fair amount of bottles as I'm aiming to taste as many various styles from various regions as I can. Because of this, I have quite a handful of opened bottles that are still more than half full! On one hand, this is a great thing in my opinion; I have whisky a'plenty. On the other hand, I'm worried that by not drinking any one bottle at a particularly steady rate that it's losing some sort of flavor. The bottles are kept out of their boxes but *out of sunlight*, and while they are opened (most have cork tops) they are kept closed unless I'm pouring a dram. 

I assume oxidation on *some* small level is happening to the bottle even while it's corked, correct? If that's the case, should I be drinking quicker? I tend to buy a bottle, give it X amount of drams, write up a review, move on to a new bottle. Think it would be better for me to just spend my time killing off one or two bottles before moving on to another so quickly? 

I suppose one of the biggest reasons I'm asking this is because I have two bottles that taste *significantly* worse from when I first bought them--Speyburn Bradan Orach (cheap single malt) and Gallacher & Dunn (cheap blend). They're both about half empty/half full now, and so it's possible that they've gotten worse from leaving them in the bottle too long with 50% of the bottle full of air, possibly making oxidation quicker and more likely to happen? Or maybe I've just tried enough better tasting whiskies recently, that in comparison, I recognize them for what they are . . . shit.","There is a [good video from Ralfy](http://youtu.be/ATdUbox20q8) talking about this exact problem. I invested in some [Wine Preservation spray](http://www.amazon.com/The-Wine-Enthusiast-Private-Preserve/dp/B001AS4NCM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1372708076&sr=8-2&keywords=wine+spray), and it seems to be working fairly well to extend the flavors of my opened bottles (Jameson 12 Year Distillery Reserve, Lagavulin 16, Laphroaig QC, Caol Ila 12).
From what I have read, the full time it takes for a bottle to fully oxidize would be around 5 years. I think that is for a 40% abv too, so the higher the ABV, the lifespan can be even greater. Of course if your bottle is less than half way full, oxidation can happen quicker, but we are talking about taking a few years off of its life span.  Even a couple of years is a huge turn around time to get rid of old bottles. 

What I usually do is if one of my bottles gets past the half way mark, the point of no return, it becomes a target to become emptied. Unless it is a very special, rare bottle, I kill it in around 2 weeks.  I often set a no ""open policy"" and a ""no buy"" policy for a few months to save some dough and get rid of old inventory.
I drink my younger whiskys more often. I have 2 older scotches (op 21 and farclas 21). I'm intentionally letting them breath since they are old. I keep the younger ones at half most of the time since that's a pretty safe amount to leave. My Laga 16 was 3/4 finished. I left it that way for 4 months. Didn't lose any flavor. So I guess I know that I know that I have a couple of months to enjoy the nearly empty whiskys more
Opened bottles?! I usually consider 1 bottle= 1 portion. 
I had a bottle of Jefferson's Presidential Select 18 that was on the last sliver of juice.  I used that spray and honestly...I think it was restorative as much as it was protective of the whiskey.  

The dram 24 hours after I used the spray was infinitely better than the dull, oxidized, shell of a drink from the day before.  

I now use it for every single open bottle past 1/4 the way empty.  
Very interesting. Thanks for the link; I haven't seen that particular Ralfy video yet. I haven't gotten to know enough whiskies on their own yet to try blending them into my own creations (although I want to do that eventually), and I don't have enough smaller glass bottles to make decanters out of, but the wine preservation spray intrigues me. Part of me is quite wary, though. Spraying gas into a bottle doesn't seem like the best idea. I have bottles of Lagavulin 16, Ardbeg, and HP12 that I want to preserve (because I probably won't drink them very fast). You recommend the wine preserver, though? Also, do you know if Ralfy ever got around to reviewing the Lagavulin 12 bottle he sprayed?
I found it really helped in extending the life of a distillery special bottle of 12 year Jameson I picked up in Dublin that I was nursing for almost two years. It was a total life saver. 
That's a good question, and I'm not sure. He does get back to the blend makes - http://youtu.be/-O3TciePJJM

From my limited experience, I haven't noticed any ruination of the whisky from the CO2 in any of my bottles. I know it has fairly positive reviews from wine lovers. 
Great to know. I think I'll give it a go soon. "
