       "690  Sweet and Oaky, quite smooth but kind of thin. Right off the bat two things hit me: I like it, and it reminds me of Weller, so I think I'm getting a WHEATER profile on this. But Weller is what we were swapping, so I don't think that's what it is. It's also a little hotter than Weller, I'm guessing 50-55%. It has a pleasant funk, which makes me think of Jim Beam or Wild Turkey but I liked it much more than Bookers(I like most stuff better than Bookers), and this isn't bold enough to be RB or RR.   \n",

I like it so far! Sweet and Oaky, quite smooth but kind of thin. Right off the bat two things hit me: I like it, and it reminds me of Weller, so I think I'm getting a WHEATER profile on this. But Weller is what we were swapping, so I don't think that's what it is. It's also a little hotter than Weller, I'm guessing 50-55%. It has a pleasant funk, which makes me think of Jim Beam or Wild Turkey but I liked it much more than Bookers(I like most stuff better than Bookers), and this isn't bold enough to be RB or RR. nan   \n",

It's quite malty, but it's a weird kind of dank, maple-y malt. Very fruity and \"fun.\" This drinks great at full proof, I'm hesitant to add water but I add a drop just in case I'm missing anything. Smooth, oaky malt. Still quite sweet and fruity, in a cherry cough syrup kind of way(like the good one, not the bad one!). A very funky, yet interesting flavor pops up, kind of like yummy, burnt root beer. A nice, spicy finish. Sweet vanilla tempered with that woody root beer funk that really lingers.   \n",

Light vanilla caramel, and it all combines into this wonderful sweet and creamy butterscotch. So sweet and smooth. quite complex but nothing overwhelms you. It has a dark cherry oakiness, light fruit, malty and nutty. Creamy and buttery on both the flavor and the mouthfeel. More butterscotch. All these flavors just glide along so smoothly and effortlessly, very pleasant. That butterscotch goodness just keeps gliding along into the finish. Bright, complex and decent length. Nutty, a little bit of light, friendly spice. Sweet, creamy vanilla oak.   \n",
       "693  Huge, dank, and friendly, like Hagrid. This is one thick, oily, Octomore, you can already tell from the nose. Quite oaky, more oak than other Octos I've had, which makes sense with the older age. Big, warm peatiness. Warm, happy fruit. That funky malt is there, but is almost overpowered by this big, bourbon-like chocolate and caramel. Taste delivers what the nose promised. So thick and oily. That warm, fuzzy peat greets you right away, big yet friendly, and gives way to sweet caramel richness. Oaky again, but not quite as dominant as the nose would suggest, melds beautifully. So chocolatey, I don't think I've ever tasted so much chocolate in a Scotch! And it works so beautifully with that heavy peat. Just coats your mouth, and it's not so much an explosion of flavor as it is a \"settling.\" All the rich, chocolatey caramel and huge peat just meld and coalesce, like your mouth is the home this Scotch has been looking for, and now it's happy and content.   \n",

It then mellows out into a sherry like chocolatey-cherry. Fruity, caramel richness Dill pickle is still there, a little better integrated than it is on the nose. Caramel, a \"roundness\" like banana. Tame cinnamon. Woody, not in a bitter oak kind of way but rather a musty, forest/camping kind of way. kind of a short, fruity finish, picks up and leaves you with the friendly woodiness   \n",
