Review #251 - Shortcross Inaugural Release Single Malt,9,1bnff24,https://i.redd.it/4zeq2axqshqc1.jpeg,1711377835,,"[{'body': ""**Review #251 - Shortcross Inaugural Release Single Malt**\r  \n\r  \nFrom Rademon Estate Distillery, we have the Shortcross-branded Irish single malt. Their inaugural release came in late 2021, and it bears a 2016 vintage, giving it an age statement of 5 years. During that time, it spent time maturing in Grand Cru Bordeaux red wine casks and Chinquapin oak casks - we could find some fruity and spicy flavors in the bottle.\r  \n\r  \nShortcross Irish whisky is made using Irish grains - unpeated malted barley, in the case of this bottle. The distillery also experiments with other grains as well, notably using rye grain and peated malted barley, as well as unmalted barley. They began operations in 2015, so their products are still quite new.\r  \n\r  \n**Shortcross Inaugural Release Single Malt**\r  \n\r  \n*Ireland - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 380 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 5 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Grand Cru Bordeaux red wine casks, Chinquapin oak finish\r  \n**Details**: 2016 vintage, bottled 2021, 658 bottles\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 2 months from a sample. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: A strong, dense nose - woody, a little bit musty, like some old red wine. There are baking spices of clove and cinnamon, some dry vanilla, and then a fruit side: orange seeds, little hints of dark fruit.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A medium thickness mouthfeel, and it's quite heavy on the cask influence despite the young age - lots of cinnamon spiced oak, tannins, pepper, and fruits of blood orange and raspberry. There are little hints of sour malt here and there, as well as soft vanilla.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Bits of sour malt and sour fruits: pomegranate, oranges, and raspberry jam. Cinnamon and white pepper, some oatmeal, and a bit of effervescence make up the aftertaste.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Not lacking flavor, but the level of distillate influence and cask influence isn't particularly balanced - this leans very heavily to the fruits of the Bordeaux and the cinnamon spice of the Chinquapin oak. There is a nice sour malt character and effervescent sensation in the finish, but those are quite subtle. A bit of a standard inaugural release from a new single malt distillery - heavy handed cask play to cover up the youth, which worked relatively well, but doesn't give us a lot of complexity.\r  \n\r  \nSince this came out a few years ago, and inaugural releases from new distilleries tend to be a collector's item, the cost of obtaining one of these bottles has shot up steeply - if you don't already have a bottle, it isn't a good value to buy now.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 6.3 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\r  \n\r  \n**Value Rating**: 3.45\r  \n\r  \n**About Us**: We're a husband and wife review team living in the Midwest United States.

Review #250 - SMWS Distillery 64 Rare Release 'Luscious Velvet' - Mannochmore 15 Year,25,1bl1i5v,https://i.redd.it/sdd3tsiiiwpc1.jpeg,1711120088,,"[{'body': ""**Review #250 - SMWS Distillery 64 Rare Release 'Luscious Velvet' - Mannochmore 15 Year**\r  \n\r  \nWhile most of the whiskies bottled by the Scotch Malt Whisky Society (SMWS) are single casks, there are occasionally some batch products, either in the form of a blend of casks from a single distillery, or a blend of distilleries. Our bottle is the former - it was created from several casks from distillery 64, the Society's code for Mannochmore, in celebration of the Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival in 2023.\r  \n\r  \nMannochmore is a little-seen whisky - this Speysider has a limited number of official bottlings, mostly in the forms of a 12 year Flora & Fauna release, the occasional Diageo special annual release, and the infamous Loch Dhu 'black whisky,' which is colored with caramel to the point that it's entirely opaque and, quite literally, black liquid. Because of that, this single malt is easier to find via independent bottlers, although it isn't the most common distillery from them, either.\r  \n\r  \nThis 15 year old bottling titled 'Luscious Velvet' in the US market ('Viscous Velvet' in other markets) is a small batch of casks, which includes Spanish oak Oloroso hogsheads, American oak PX hogsheads, and other refill hogsheads. It yielded a little over 2,000 bottles; based on the emphasis on sherry maturation, we'll be looking for some sweet, fruity flavors.\r  \n\r  \n**SMWS Distillery 64 Rare Release 'Luscious Velvet' - Mannochmore 15 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 155 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 15 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 53.1% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: First fill Spanish oak ex-Oloroso hogsheads, first fill American oak ex-Pedro Ximenez hogsheads, refill hogsheads\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added; 2,119 bottles\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 9 months; bottles at 100%, 70% (blind tasting), 60%, and 50% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Mature, polished, old oak - like antique furniture, slightly perfumed. Rich, with some syrupy sweet notes behind the oak, including fruits of pineapple, plum, pomegranate, and cherry; there are hints of chocolate and a whiff of wood smoke, too. Fruit compote and purple flowers are subtle accent flavors; the emphasis is on that polished oak.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium-thick mouthfeel - wow. Rich and diverse in sweet flavors. Tropical fruits of mango and pineapple; red fruits of raspberry, cherry, or blackberry; lots of old polished oak and fresh leather, as well as sweet cigarillos; hints of cocoa and perfume, too. There's a great velvety, creamy texture, and hints of spiced oak arrive at the back of the palate.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Old wood, syrup and polish, some sweet floral perfume. Fruits transition more to dried fruits like orange, prune, and cranberry; more baking spice like cardamom in this finish, as well as malty chocolate. Hints of wood smoke and sweet cinnamon linger; quite elegant, and medium-long in length.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Maybe they should have named this bottling '15 going on 50' - this is by far the most mature tasting 15 year old single malt that we've tried. It's unusual for a 15 year old whisky to be labeled as 'Old and Dignified' by the Society (denoted by the rich red-colored label details), but it makes a bit more sense after tasting this bottle.\r  \n\r  \nThis was the first Mannochmore whisky that we had the chance to try, and while not all of them will live up to an experience like this, we'll definitely be looking for more ways to taste whisky from this distillery - more adventures into the IB world, then.\r  \n\r  \nTo sum it up - gorgeous, old-tasting whisky, more mature than it has any right to be. One of the rare whiskies that, after tasting it, we wish we could go back and pick up 2 or 3 more bottles for the original price, despite it being in excess of $150.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 9.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Reviews #247 & #248 - Old Pulteney 12 Current vs Old Bottling,47,1bimea0,https://i.redd.it/dkkomw423bpc1.jpeg,1710860650,,"[{'body': ""**Reviews #247 & #248 - Old Pulteney 12 Current vs Old Bottling**\n\nPulteney Distillery revamped their core range of Old Pulteney branded whiskies several years ago - they dropped the tasty 17 and 21 year age statements, and now we have a 15 year old, 18 year old, and 25 year old. Still, there was one constant that continued from the prior generation to the current one: the 12 year old.\n\nThere are a few differences between the whisky in this older bottling and the current versions - the strength used to be 43% ABV (for the US market, at least), but now we get it at 40% ABV. There's also quite a significant difference in color, with the older liquid being much darker... hard to say whether that's an indication of the cask types, average age of the liquid, or some amount of added caramel coloring.\n\nSo, how do these two, separated by roughly 20 years, stack up against each other? Was whisky actually better in the past, or is that a myth?\n___\n\n**Old Pulteney 12 Year (c. 2022 bottling)**\n\n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 50 (2023)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 49 (2024)\n\n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\n\n**Strength**: 40% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon casks\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 5 times over 6 months; bottles at 100%, 90% (blind tasting), 80% (blind tasting), 70% (blind tasting), and 30% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Soft and rounded, lots of those ex-bourbon notes: vanilla, dry wood, lemon, baked bread; white pepper, buttered toast, ripe banana, white grape, grapeseed oil, hay\n\n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium-thin; tart with lemon, white wine, dry vanilla, and some unripe pear. There's a sweeter side that adds butterscotch and lemon curd, maybe some cardamom; hints of honey and salt. Overall, light complexion, and a little lacking in strength of flavor\n\n**Finish**: Medium-short, with light oak and bourbon wood notes: vanilla, a hint of cream, clove, and lemons.

Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Musty, with sweet polished oak, lots of old furniture oak. Wood flavors are dominant, but behind that, we find sweet scents of heather, soft tropical fruits like guava, chalky malt, and dark caramel\n\n**Palate**: A medium-thin mouthfeel, but a decent amount of flavor; perfumed oak, sweet and oily, lightly floral and heathery, generally quite sweet. Baking notes of brown sugar and cinnamon, some vanilla and wildflower honey syrup, and there's a little hint of orange and raisin hiding in the background. Very mature, with an emphasis on those oak flavors\n\n**Finish**: Medium length, sweet, almost saccharine. More perfumed oak, hints of oats and malt, syrupy, butterscotch, and vanilla. In the aftertaste, there's a slightly fizzy and floral element\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 7.5 / 10\n\n**Value Rating**: 8.43\n___\n\n**Final Note**: This is only one example, so we can't make any sweeping generalizations about new whisky and old whisky as a whole, but in this case, the difference is clear: the older bottlings of Old Pulteney 12 Year are absolutely a class above the newer versions. There's so much more maturity and flavor development in the older bottling, and while a 3% difference in bottling strength isn't a huge difference, it definitely helped in this case.\n\nWe were able to get these two bottles for roughly the same price, so we can make a good comparison when it comes to value - because of the better flavors in the old bottle, it is an excellent value, compared to a mediocre value in the current bottle. If you're able to find one of these old bottles for a reasonable price, we would say it's worth a shot; we don't surf the auctions too often, but we'll definitely be on the lookout for more of these older Old Pulteney bottlings.\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #245 - Old Pulteney 21 Year,58,1bfenkp,https://i.redd.it/kffxom958ioc1.jpeg,1710511317,,"[{'body': ""**Review #245 - Old Pulteney 21 Year**\r  \n\r  \nFar up the Eastern coast of the Northern Scottish highlands, you can find Pulteney distillery residing in the town of Wick. The distillery produces whisky for the Old Pulteney brand, and has a relatively large capacity, producing nearly 1.5 million lpa in recent years. Their whiskies are known for their unpeated, coastal, oily character - subtle characteristics, considering that the malt is generally considered to have lighter flavors.\r  \n\r  \nIntroduced in 2005, this 21 year old bottling spent time maturing in refill ex-bourbon casks, as well as ex-Fino sherry casks. The flavors should theoretically be a bit more nuanced and less overpowering coming from that cask selection, so we're hoping that this single malt has aged gracefully during its wait of more than two decades.\r  \n\r  \nThe 21 year expression from Old Pulteney was discontinued in 2017, alongside the beloved 17 year old; because of that, it's very challenging to find a bottle anywhere other than an auction, where the prices are rising for this increasingly rare single malt.\r  \n\r  \n**Old Pulteney 21 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 640 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 21 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Refill ex-bourbon casks and ex-Fino sherry casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 2 months from a sample. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Old perfumed oak, sweet, almost syrupy sweet. Very mature, and the sherry maturation brings fruits of peach, grape, and dried purple fruit.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel has a medium thickness; like the nose, strong perfumed oak is the first flavor, along with brown sugar and rich caramel. Hints of dried fruit and orange citrus come and go, and the texture it quite oily; with time, a hint of salty flavor develops.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, with a soft texture - it's oily, and it lingers for a while. Mature polished oak notes, heather and floral perfume, and peach compete for space; in the aftertaste, malt and vanilla grow stronger.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is a gorgeous whisky - tastes even more mature than most 21 year whiskies in our experience, possibly hinting at a few older casks mixed in. Pulteney has routinely released whiskies from 30 to 40 years old in recent years, so we wouldn't be surprised if they were bumping up the average age of the 21 year whisky with some older liquid - they clearly had the stocks available.\r  \n\r  \nThis was generally a sweeter experience, not too much on the spicy or tart side; it was all about that perfumed oak for us.\r  \n\r  \nAlas, despite the great flavor experience, this is now too expensive to be considered any sort of good value. Auction prices will fluctuate over time, but recently we haven't seen anything below $400, and if we want to buy a bottle online right now, it's going to cost over $600 in our area.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 8.5 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #243 - Baker's 7 Year Single Barrel,27,1bduqns,https://i.redd.it/z5m22jy8h4oc1.jpeg,1710344823,,"[{'body': ""**Review #243 - Baker's 7 Year Single Barrel**\n\nJim Beam's 'Baker's' brand, named for Baker Beam (one of the Beam family members) is distilled at the Clermont facility. It's a single barrel product, which is aged for a minimum of seven years before bottling, though it's possible to find older bottles with a bit of searching. Once they dump the barrels, they bottle the bourbon at a nice 107 proof strength, so flavor should be in no short supply.\n\nFor our review, we tasted from a couple of distinct bottles of Baker's 7 - one single barrel had an age statement of 7 years and 10 months (warehouse CL-J), while the other barrel was aged for 8 years and 10 months (warehouse CL-H). Our goal is to give more of a generalized review of the product, as opposed to an individual review of a single barrel.\n\n**Baker's 7 Year Single Barrel**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 50 (2023)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 50 (2024)\n\n**Age Statement**: 7+ Years\n\n**Strength**: 53.5% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 8 months; bottles at 70%, 100%, 80%, and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Quite woody and oaky, nutty as well - leathery oak, wood smoke, barbecued wood, as well as raw almonds and dusty peanut brittle. Spices like cinnamon and clove are present, some black pepper too, and there's the tiniest hint of orange and cherry from time to time.\n\n**Palate**: A medium thickness mouthfeel; a nice reflection of the nose. Woody with dry oak and hints of bitterness, strong barbecued wood, and lots of baking spices: pepper, nutmeg, cloying clove, and dry vanilla. There's a nutty character, dry nuts specifically, and then hints of sweetness. Generally, though, quite dry.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length, warming, and becoming more balanced. There's still drying oak and dusty peanut, but we also get brown sugar, candied pecans, rum, and cooking spice.\n\n**Final Note**: Not too simple but not overly complex either - there's decent flavor development, but it's almost all in the direction of woody and nutty flavors. A bit of a classic Jim Beam profile, and while it is strongly oaked for a product that's seven or so years old, it doesn't ever come across as too bitter.\n\nValue is pretty good here - we've been seeing it more often on the shelves of local stores in the last year or two, so availability is increasing, and at the $50 price point, it isn't a huge gamble. There will be some variation between barrels, of course, with some shining and some more average, but our general experience was good.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 6.8 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #242 - Yamazaki 12 Year,18,1bcz2xu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bcz2xu,1710255030,,"[{'body': ""**Review #242 - Yamazaki 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \nSuntory labels the Yamazaki single malt as their flagship product on their website, as they explain it is Japan's oldest malt whisky distillery - here, we have the 12 Year Old version, the second step in their core range, after the 'Distiller's Reserve' takes the entry level spot. This is a real Japanese whisky, as opposed to many whiskies coming from the country these days, which are sourced from other countries and labeled as Japanese due to the country's current lax whisky regulations.\r  \n\r  \nThis spends time aging in American, Spanish, and Japanese oak, according to the brand - presumably some mixture of ex-bourbon, ex-sherry, and Mizunara oak maturation, then. Should be a nice mixture of flavors with that cask variety, and due to the age statement, we should get some nice maturity as well; whether or not the flavors can overcome that slightly low 43% bottling strength is another point entirely.\r  \n\r  \n**Yamazaki 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Japan - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 170 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: American oak, Spanish oak, and Japanese oak casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 1 month from a sample (thanks u/whiskytrails !).

Quite subtle and delicate.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A medium-thin mouthfeel; soft and subtle again, with a mix of floral, woody, and baking notes. Hints of white pepper and black pepper, some dry oak, a bit of cinnamon and barley grain; there's just a tiny bit of orchard fruit, along with some salty and chalky tones. With time, the floral side grows stronger.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Soft oily texture with barley flavors, leaning a little dry as opposed to sweet. Wood spice, heather, perfume, and hay come to mind; there's a hint of white grape again, along with soft vanilla and more chalk. Medium in length.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Quite soft and subtle, and the complexity is a moderate level in our experience - not boring, but a bit simpler than we hoped. The subtle flavors and lower bottling strength don't allow this to deliver a standout experience, but it is pleasant to sip on, especially if you enjoy light, floral notes.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately, because of the reputation and limited production of Japanese whisky in the last decade, the prices on this have shot up to a crazy level; $170 for a 12 year old, 43% whisky feels a bit overpriced.

Review #241 - Master of Malt Cambus 30 Year (1991 Vintage),17,1bc5g03,https://i.redd.it/87kbpmst0qnc1.jpeg,1710169827,,"[{'body': ""**Review #241 - Master of Malt Cambus 30 Year (1991 Vintage)**\r  \n\r  \nA bottling by Master of Malt, a UK-based online retailer of spirits - this is a 1991 vintage Cambus, a single grain whisky from Scotland. It aged for 30 years in a refill hogshead, though the previous contents of the cask are not specified - it could have been an ex-bourbon or ex-sherry cask.\r  \n\r  \nCambus, a closed distillery, created grain spirit up until 1993, so this bottling contains spirit from the last couple of years of production. It was closed in order to allow owners Diageo to focus on other projects, so the distillate is becoming more difficult to find, now that it's been closed for more than 30 years. Most of the distillery was demolished, but a few buildings are still in use by the drinks conglomerate, notably some warehouse space. On that site, a more recently built cooperage means the area still participates in whisky production, in a slightly different way.\r  \n\r  \n**Master of Malt Cambus 30 Year (1991 Vintage)**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland - Single Grain*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 140 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 30 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 50.8% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Refill hogshead\r  \n**Details**: Distilled May 1991, bottled June 2021; 100 bottles\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 5 times over 3 months; bottles at 80%, 50%, 90% (blind tasting), 50%, and 30% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: A noticeable grain influence coming through - softly floral, sweet, full of baking spices. Honey and oats, hay, brown sugar, and cinnamon were stronger notes, while soft flavors of vanilla, prune, fig, and honeycomb hid in the background. There isn't a lot of oak despite the 30 years of aging; becomes creamier with time.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A medium-thick mouthfeel; oak is stronger now, along with lots of grain notes like oatmeal; baking spices of cinnamon, cardamom, clove, and nutmeg are plentiful. There are soft fruits like cranberry, or unripe strawberry, but those are very subtle; artificial vanilla and creamy grain continue to grow stronger as it progresses.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Warming and decent richness, with a hint of savory character; cinnamon, anise, vanilla, and nutmeg, this is all about baking spice. A creamy mouthfeel lingers into this finish, and there are oats, milk, and chalky grain in the aftertaste.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Nice on the nose, but a little more simple on the palate and into the finish. Like a lot of single grain whiskies, the impact of aging here is much more gentle - those refill casks don't add a lot of mature oak notes to the experience. There was a bit of an overly creamy, borderline milky note with the oats on the back end that wasn't to our personal taste, as well, but it didn't seem like a quality issue.\r  \n\r  \nIn terms of the age statement, you'll be hard-pressed to find another 30 year old whisky near this price, at least in our market, especially for a closed distillery.

Review #240 - Kilkerran 16 Year,38,1b9rw78,https://i.redd.it/wioqdu3mx4nc1.jpeg,1709914470,,"[{'body': ""**Review #240 - Kilkerran 16 Year**\r  \n\r  \nFrom Glengyle Distillery, we have the Kilkerran single malt brand. Today, we're taking a look at their 16 year old whisky, supposedly with a majority of ex-bourbon maturation, as well as a bit of ex-sherry cask influence. Glengyle gives us the quality specs, like its sister distillery, Springbank: 46% ABV for the strength, and there's no artificial coloring or chill filtration used.\r  \n\r  \n**Kilkerran 16 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Campbeltown - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 125 (2022)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 130 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 16 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: 75% ex-bourbon casks, 25% ex-sherry casks\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added; 2021 release\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 6 months; bottles at 100%, 80% (blind tasting), 70%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Spirit-forward - crisp, light and slightly dry, with oak, vanilla, and white pepper. There's a soft funk, and then we move to exotic guava, cream, agave, and a bit of a yeasty note. Very light peat smoke wafts in, and we get hints of melon, orange fruit, and hay; overall, quite subtle, even delicate.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Nice, honeyed, moderate richness, but still subtle. Lots of melon, watermelon, and a sharp fruit like lemon preserve; there's a spiced side with clove, anise, a hint of polished wood, and some malt. In the background, layers of musty moss and cellar funk linger, but those are quite subtle. The mouthfeel has a medium thickness.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, subtle and complex; vanilla bean, anise, and white pepper add a baking element, while sweet melon and lemon give us lingering notes of fruit. Oak is mild, and it becomes more perfumed with time.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: A very good single malt, if a little bit subtle overall, at least for this 2021 bottling. It's definitely bourbon cask-forward, with nice tropical fruit notes and baking spice, and the level of peat is very soft; flavors aren't too punchy in general, but it's quite an elegant drink.\r  \n\r  \nIn terms of value - this is a moderately expensive single malt for its age statement here is the US; any Springbank or Kilkerran product ends up with a bit of a markup after the importation, distribution, and retail processes, as the true 'value' and desirability of these single malts is well known. Because of that, value is just okay - a good single malt, but there's more flavor available elsewhere for $130.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.6 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #239 - SMWS 7.267 'Nomad's Tent Vibe' - Longmorn 12 Year,23,1b8y0nv,https://i.redd.it/oqawy74moxmc1.jpeg,1709826706,,"[{'body': ""**Review #239 - SMWS 7.267 'Nomad's Tent Vibe' - Longmorn 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \nLongmorn distillery - not the easiest whisky to find, but some of their malts are said to be favorites of master distillers from other distilleries (after their own distillate, of course) around Scotland. This Speyside distillery is situated the heart of the sub-region, just south of Elgin; currently, the most common release is the re-launched 16 year old, and this single malt is also available as a part of the 'Secret Speyside' collection.\r  \n\r  \nThe Scotch Malt Whisky Society matured this Longmorn spirit in a first fill ex-bourbon barrel for 12 years, before bottling it at a natural cask strength of 64% ABV. Considering that strength after 12 years of evaporation, this may be a barrel that was filled at still strength, as opposed to being watered down to the typical 62% to 64% barrel entry strength.\r  \n\r  \n**SMWS 7.267 'Nomad's Tent Vibe' - Longmorn 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 130 (2022)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 64% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: First fill ex-bourbon barrel\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added; distilled September 11, 2008; 233 bottles\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 10 months; bottles at 90%, 80%, and 70% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review.

There's a bit of perfume with the oak, some polished oak as well; with time, subtle scents of berries and white chocolate come forward, bubblegum at times.  Elderflower and sweet fruits round us out: glazed strawberry, white grape, and pear.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is thick; woody and rich, with caramelized sugar, vanilla, wood spice, and a bit of wood char. Nice baking spices like nutmeg and cardamom - the cask seems to have been quite active. Burnt sugar and a hint of cream add to the baking theme, before fruit arrives: apricot, orange, and fizzy pineapple.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, nice and warm with that high strength. Quite oily and coating, and heavy on the baking spices now - vanilla, baked goods, burnt sugar, and pepper spice. In the aftertaste, there's subtle heather and perfume.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Really packed with flavor, and those first fill bourbon casks have been very active during the 12 year maturation, adding lots of oak and baking spice notes. This bottle falls under the 'Sweet Fruity & Mellow' category from the SMWS, but the fruity aspect was a bit more of a subtle undertone for us, and we didn't find the overall experience too mellow, considering the strength.\r  \n\r  \nNot taking the annual membership price into consideration, value for the bottle itself is alright - it does pack quite a punch, and it opened up nicely with time.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.8 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Famed for its reasonable price (considering the high proof and 12 year age statement), Elijah Craig Barrel Proof is a bit of a fan favorite in the bourbon community.\n\nThese are the first two releases after Heaven Hill made the decision to drop that standard 12 year age statement - B523 was aged for 11 years and 5 months, while C923 went above and beyond... the youngest whisky in the batch spent 13 years and 7 months maturing. Already, we have a bit of a differentiating factor, and here's another: B523 has a strength of 62.1% ABV (124.2 proof), while C923 gets an eye-watering 66.5% ABV (133 proof). Two points to C923, then.\n\nThe question is: will those factors actually lead to better flavor and stronger delivery?\n\n___\n\n**Elijah Craig Barrel Proof Batch B523**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Current Local Price**: USD 80 (2024)\n\n**Age Statement**: 11 Years\n\n**Strength**: 62.1% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 5 months; bottles at 30% and 40% fill levels at times of review.

The extra age absolutely added more maturity, especially with the increased flavors like tobacco smoke, dark chocolate, and leather. C923 does drink a little hot, but that's part of the appeal with that huge proof point.\n\nBoth of these are good value - EC Barrel Proof continues to be one of the best bets for strong flavor and relatively consistent quality in the sub $100 category. In our opinion, both would be worth picking up at the suggested retail price, and C923 might even be worth a bit of a (reasonable) markup, if you're still able to find a bottle.\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

These days, many enthusiasts will suggest searching for Bowmore that's bottled by independent bottlers, instead of spending on distillery bottlings.\r  \n\r  \nThis is a whisky that's most certainly neutered - a minimum bottling strength of 40% ABV, along with plenty of chill filtration and added caramel color.

Savory sausage, wood smoke, and orange fruit flavors are plentiful.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length or so, with musty smoke and herbal notes lingering - slightly menthol, and a bit savory. Soft wood astringency is paired with floral perfume, and there's just a hint of a dark purple fruit, like oversweet blackberry.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: A pleasant casual sipper for those looking for Islay peat, but not wanting an overwhelming peat bomb. The musty, savory character was quite nice, and the accents of fruits and perfume added some complexity. In one tasting, the briny character really began to dominate in the palate, too.

Review #235 - Benromach 2010 Organic 5 Year,29,1b6e78v,https://i.redd.it/qgvhqj1j9cmc1.jpeg,1709567379,,"[{'body': ""**Review #235 - Benromach 2010 Organic 5 Year**\r  \n\r  \nBenromach, with some peat - once upon a time, a bit unusual for a Speysider, but now, it seems that most of the distilleries do a peated run at some point in the year. On top of the peating process, this 'Springbank of Speyside' also does organic whisky production at some times - quite an intensive process, as it adds more restrictive requirements to every part of the whisky-making process: barley growing, malting, mashing, fermenting, distillation, and maturation all must be looked after carefully to ensure no contamination with non-organic substances.\r  \n\r  \nThese older Benromach bottles often didn't come with a surplus of details - indeed, this time, there's no mention of the cask types used. Still, with only 5 years of aging, we're expecting a spirit-forward experience, anyways.\r  \n\r  \n**Benromach 2010 Organic 5 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 62 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 5 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Details**: 2010 vintage, bottled in 2015\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 12 months; bottles at 100%, 60%, 40% (blind tasting), and 10% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Quite a lot going on - it's earthy, musty, slightly vegetal to start. Plenty of woody notes, with dry oak, wood smoke, slight bitterness; then, lots of sweet fruit and baking notes arrive. We get grape, green apple, wildflower honey, salted caramels, fresh strawberries, barley sugar, and vanilla... with time, even orange sherbet, and a star anise kick. All over the place really; peat smoke is mild, and it gets more funky with time.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium-thin; quite spicy and funky, and very spirit-dominated. Earthy flavors, green plants, and peat are strong, while there's spice of licorice, anise, dry oak, and a bit of cinnamon. Fruits like green apple, pear, and plum are accent flavors; there's soft, grainy barley sugar in the background.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, with some industrial funk, lingering peat smoke, and astringency from oak and spices. A bit young, with warm spirit and white pepper, and anise adds a kick; rhubarb pie and honey add sweet flavors, and there's a soft hint of sulfur, maybe hinting at a sherry cask. \r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: There are times that the term 'organic' or a certain whisky region might suggest some funkiness to our minds, but that power of suggestion isn't necessary here - this is an in-your-face, youthful blast of funk and vegetal notes. The peat is more of an accent flavor, but we get plants and autumn leaf flavors in spades; it felt like ex-bourbon maturation for the most part, with the light, dry fruits and some baking spices.\r  \n\r  \nAn interesting one, for sure, if a bit unpolished and young; still, it was always fun to dissect, and it never lacked flavor.

From the Midleton distillery (along with a huge number of other brands such as Jameson, Midleton Very Rare, the Spot whiskies, etc.), this whisky is one of the more well-established quality Irish options that's garnered widespread acclaim.\r  \n\r  \nThis standard 12 Year bottling is aged in a combination of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks, and it's a mix of American oak and Spanish oak, so we should have some sweet notes and some spicy notes. Unfortunately for us enthusiasts, they bottle this at the bare minimum 40% ABV - luckily, there's the cask strength version for us to fall back on when we're looking for more punch.\r  \n\r  \n**Redbreast 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Ireland - Single Pot Still*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 55 (2021)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 57 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 40% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: American oak ex-bourbon casks, Spanish oak ex-Oloroso sherry casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 3 months; bottles at 50%, 40%, and 30% fill levels at times of review.

Hints of grain here and there, and we get a bit of orange, or slightly bitter orange seeds.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel has a medium-thin viscosity; heavy on the baking spices overall, with lots of clove, cinnamon, brown sugar, and hints of pepper. There are soft fruits of orange and lemon peel, even a touch of dried fig; oak is soft, and that mild grainy character returns, but it's subtle.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-short, a bit simple. Lemon peel and sour dried fruit wafts in, but this is mostly woody spices: star anise, vanilla, cardamom, other nondescript brown baking spices. Hints of hay and malt come from time to time.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: We enjoyed the acidic fruits notes throughout the experience, but overall, this has dipped a little bit in our view - it comes across as more grainy, and the plain baking spices don't hold our attention as much. Really, it's the bottling strength that's at fault for stopping the flavors from being delivered with more gusto.\r  \n\r  \nDespite the slightly plain character, this is still a nice casual sipper, and value isn't too bad - not cheap, but it's reasonably priced in our market, and quite a bit cheaper than any of the other Redbreast options.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 6.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #233 - Kilchoman Loch Gorm (2022),57,1b32zg5,https://i.redd.it/82nmwlcxljlc1.jpeg,1709220464,,"[{'body': ""Which is everyone's favorite peat + sherry whisky?"", 'score': 7}, {'body': ""**Review #233 - Kilchoman Loch Gorm (2022)**\r  \n\r  \nSherry and peat - a match made in heaven for a lot of us. This single malt from Kilchoman goes all in with heavy peat and sherry maturation - it's around 50 ppm on the barley for smokiness, and full sherry maturation for the casks. We should be in for a treat, as long as the quality is there.\r  \n\r  \nThe casks used for this release came from Bodega Jose y Miguel Martin, where they were used to age Oloroso sherry. It's a mix of first fill and refill casks, and while this release isn't age stated, the fine print on their website describes that the whisky aged for at least 8 years in these sherry casks. In fact, they give us vintages for each of the casks, some really interesting information:\n\n* 2007 - 1 cask (theoretically around 14-15 years old)\r\n* 2008 - 2 casks (13-14 years old)\r\n* 2009 - 2 casks (12-13 years old)\r\n* 2011 - 1 cask (10-11 years old)\r\n* 2012 - 7 casks (9-10 years old)\r\n* 2013 - 9 casks (8-9 years old)\n\nSome nice age in the blend of casks, then, so there could be a few mature flavors, despite 8 to 10 year old whisky making up the bulk of the liquid.\r  \n\r  \nKilchoman always gives us quality presentation - no chill filtration, no added caramel coloring, and a 46% ABV bottling strength.\r  \n\r  \n**Kilchoman Loch Gorm (2022)**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 100 (2022)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 115 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: 20 first fill and 2 refill ex-Oloroso sherry butts\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added; 2022 release, 17,250 bottles\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 15 months; bottles at 100%, 80%, 60%, and 40% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Barbecue in a glass - salty, saucy meat, medium to strong peat smoke, hints of balsamic. Plentiful fruit: torched lemon rind, candy orange slices, hints of plum and stone fruit, too. There's a soft mossy and medicinal character in the background, with hints of burning rubber and char. Later, more fruit: cranberries, pomegranate, and lime.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Tangy and tingling, with a nice mix of sweet and sour. The mouthfeel is medium; there's relatively strong peat smoke, with some dry oak and spices of peppercorns and red pepper flakes. Orange fruit is strong, while hints of tart stone fruit linger behind; a nice ashy, charcoal flavor as well, with more salt.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, smoky for a while, but there's this brittle, ashy character to the peat. Orange fruit, even orange soda, adds sweetness, while lots of char, balsamic, medicinal notes, and drying wood add a more bitter side. At the end, it's like tasting those charred food remains on the grate of a barbecue grill.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This must be one of the most mature-tasting bottlings we've tried from Kilchoman - the older casks in the mix really do add a nice oak element along with the rich fruity character from the sherry. Great flavors, and while the 46% ABV is nice, we wouldn't mind seeing that bumped up just a little bit for more flavor delivery.\r  \n\r  \nValue is fine - about average, but this bottling is making its way into pricy territory, especially with the most recent releases in 2022 and 2023. With Kilchoman choosing to go with a seriously premium pricing strategy for their recent 16 year old release, will we see that status trickle down to these other bottlings in the coming years? Only time will tell, but it wouldn't be a surprise to see these limited release Kilchomans slipping from a value perspective.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.4 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Madeira, a sweet fortified wine from Portugal, could potentially add some dark fruit flavors to this whisky.\n\nAs always, the full breakdown of the whiskies involved in the blend is on their website:\n\n* 18 year old rye whisky aged in ex-Madeira casks\n* 19 year old rye whisky aged in Hungarian oak barrels\n* 22 year old corn whisky aged in new American oak barrels\n* 23 year old corn whisky aged in new American oak barrels\n* 23 year old corn whisky aged in ex-bourbon barrels\n* 26 year old corn whisky aged in Hungarian oak barrels\n\n**Found North Batch 008**\n\n*USA/Canada - Blend*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 160 (2023)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 160 (2024)\n\n**Age Statement**: 18 Years\n\n**Strength**: 62.2% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: Hungarian oak, new American oak, ex-bourbon barrels, ex-Madeira casks\n\n**Details**: Batch 008, 2,925 bottles; not chill filtered, no color added; mashbill of 87% corn, 12% rye, and 1% malted barley\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 2 months; bottles at 100%, 90%, and 80% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Rich, sweet and dark - an overwhelming note in the beginning of plums, blueberries, sugar-coated blackberries, and rye spice. Time brings aged notes: leather, sharp tobacco smoke, sweet oak, and very dark sugars - brown sugar, more sugary blackberries.\n\n**Palate**: Super juicy dark fruits - blackberry, raisin, grape, even syrupy cocktail cherries. Extremely dense dark oak, which transitions to savory cigar smoke and some molasses. Cranberry sauce, raspberries, and brown sugar - the sweet notes continue. There's also a decent amount of rye in here, with spice like black pepper, but also herbal qualities - peppermint and hints of eucalyptus. The mouthfeel is thick.\n\n**Finish**: A very long finish, with warmth from the bottling strength and some balanced oak, adding sweet sugar notes and a hint of woody smoke. Peppermint, purple fruits, cayenne, cigars, hints of orange - this has it all. Very oily, the syrupy mouthfeel lingers for a long time.\n\n**Final Note**: Wow. It's amazing how strong the influence of that rye component is in the blend, when the Madeira-finished rye was only 4% of the blend, and all of the rye involved is only 12% of the mash bill.\n\nThe nose is rich, and the palate is an explosion of sweet and mature flavors, with a heavy emphasis on fruits and old smoky oak. One of the best whiskies we've ever tasted, without a doubt.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 9.2 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\n\n**Value Rating**: 6.75\n\n**About Us**: We're a husband and wife review team living in the Midwest United States. Generally, our reviews and tasting notes will be a compilation of both of our experiences with a whisky over several tasting sessions.\n\n**Interested in more?

Found North releases have not fallen under an 8 at worst in my book where value is concerned. \n\nEveryone's opinions are different, but if I had a 10/10 grade on my hands it'd be difficult to rate the value of it average or low unless its MSRP was higher than a competing 10/10. Bourbons and blends with competing prices include Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend, Russel's 13 BP, Booker's, Michter's 10, WhistlePig 12 Year. Just the top of my head. Found North 008 is at or significantly below these MSRPs and outcompetes them all in certain ways performance-wise.

The brand gives us a handy breakdown of the individual components on their website:\n\n\\- 1998 vintage (24 years old) corn whisky aged in ex-bourbon barrels\n\n\\- 22 year old corn whisky aged in ex-bourbon barrels\n\n\\- 22 year old corn whisky aged in new American oak barrels\n\n\\- 2004 vintage (18 years old) rye whisky aged in Hungarian oak barrels\n\nThe overall blend is 18 years and 11 months old, with a predominantly corn-led mashbill. It comes in at a blistering cask strength of 65.9% ABV (131.8 proof), and it's fully unadulterated, not subject to any chill filtration.\n\n**Found North Batch 007**\n\n*USA/Canada - Blend*\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 160 (2024)\n\n**Age Statement**: 18 Years\n\n**Strength**: 65.9% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: Hungarian oak, new American oak, ex-bourbon barrels\n\n**Details**: Batch 007, 3,345 bottles; not chill filtered, no color added; mashbill of 83% corn, 16% rye, and 1% malted barley\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 1 month from a sample. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Dark and dense - brown sugar, oak, soft leather, and maple syrup. It's a bit closed up or reserved at first, but with more time, orange and dark red berries can be found hidden underneath the sugary molasses sweetness. Little hints of corn and alcohol sharpness from time to time, too.\n\n**Palate**: A thick mouthfeel, syrupy and very rich. Flavor is quite a bit stronger on the palate - old oak, cigar smoke, unsmoked tobacco, and fresh leather. Red berries return, along with some peppery rye spice; strong black pepper in the late palate. Very densely flavored.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-long, with strong flavors of perfumed oak and cigar smoke lingering. There's barbecued wood and leather later, hints of pipe smoke, and in the aftertaste, some cinnamon and red fruit.\n\n**Final Note**: Another excellent whisky from Found North. The reserved nose was the only item preventing this from scoring even higher, but the palate opened with fantastic flavors. It's strongly oaked, but it never approaches over-oaking at all - perfect balance, great maturity. Like all of the Found North whiskies we've tried so far, the alcohol is amazingly well-integrated; even at these high cask strength levels, there's never a sharp alcohol burn... it drinks under its proof.\n\nValue is average, maybe even decent, despite the $160 cost. It's hard to find another brand that delivers this level of flavor so consistently for the price point.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 9.0 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #230 - Compass Box No Name No. 3,65,1b0l5fo,https://i.redd.it/gfciilb3eykc1.jpeg,1708963570,,"[{'body': ""**Review #230 - Compass Box No Name No. 3**\r  \n\r  \nThis special release from Compass Box, bottled in 2021, is the third in the series of 'No Name' blended malts. These blends have all focused on peated malt, with Caol Ila, Ardbeg, Talisker, and Laphroaig headlining some of the blends. In fact, on the back of this bottle of this third edition, they give us a detailed breakdown of the components:\r  \n\r  \n\\- 74.7% is Laphroaig aged in recharred hogsheads\r  \n\\- 11.3% is Bowmore aged in refill ex-bourbon barrels\r  \n\\- 7.5% is Mortlach aged in recharred barrels\r  \n\\- 6.0% is Clynelish aged in refill ex-sherry butts\r  \n\\- 0.5% is Compass Box's famous 'Highland Blend' aged in highly toasted French oak casks\r  \n\r  \nThose are some excellent distilleries in the mix - some good expectations, then, before we even taste it. Quite a range of casks, as well, which points to a more complex flavor profile. There's no age statement given, either as a whole, or for the individual components, as the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) won't allow that breakdown to be publicly stated.\r  \n\r  \nAs per usual with Compass Box, we get quality presentation: 48.9% is the strength, and there's no added coloring or chill filtration to worry about.\r  \n\r  \n**Compass Box No Name No. 3**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland - Blend*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 140 (2023)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 197 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 48.9% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Refill ex-bourbon, refill ex-sherry, recharred hogsheads, recharred barrels, and highly-toasted French oak casks\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added; bottled in July of 2021; 10,794 bottles\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 3 months; bottles at 60%, 50% (blind tasting), 40%, and 50% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Medium bordering on strong peat smoke, and the flavors go a few directions. There's a woody character, along with heather or flowers, almost a perfume note; hints of vegetal and savory layers are found underneath. Light citrus of lime and lemon curd, and a soft spirit note; becomes more creamy and sweet with time.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium-thick, with a creamy texture, some nice weight to the spirit. Peat smoke is medium to strong, and it comes with lots of light fruit and baking flavors: barley sugar, vanilla, meaty orange, lemons, yellow cake, thick custard. Hints of wood smoke here and there, white pepper adds soft spice, and there's a bit of ash and tangy lime later.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Lingering smoke - medium-long for the finish, with oily texture, hints of wood char, and weighty spirit adding to the effect. There's a bit of sweetness still from vanilla, refined sugar, and lemon curd, as well as savory charred orange rind and an aftertaste of hot peppers.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Really nice peated blended malt. The flavors aren't especially strange or diverse, but there's enough complexity to keep it interesting all the time. The quality that really made this stand out to us was the texture, the mouthfeel - thicker than the ABV would make us think, and the weight of the spirit as it lingers into the finish really stood out. Great velvety texture, and along with the creamy mouthfeel, some creamy flavors as well - quite good.\r  \n\r  \nSpecial edition whiskies - they often aren't good value, even if it's a good flavor experience. This is tasty, but it comes with a price, and because of the limited nature of the product, that value ratio is only going to get worse as the price rises. It's already gotten $50+ more expensive for a bottle in our area in the last year, so if you're looking to buy, we recommend doing it sooner rather than later.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.9 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Heavily peated, so bearing some resemblance to the Compass Box No Name series you've reviewed here. Very deep, dark & rich in flavor - and endlessly fascinating to try to guess at which 3 single malts were involved.\n\nAdelphi Winter Queen 19 yo - an international fusion blend of Zuidam (Millstone), Bowmore, Mortlach & Teaninich which was my personal favorite new whisky of the year last year. Very complex, many layers, featuring stereotypical flavors from each of the first three malts listed which in spite of being evident as individual notes are very harmonious together, not fighting each other. A choir singing in tune, as it were. \n\nGordon & MacPhail Highland Fusiliers Tercentenary 21 yo, bottled 1978. The best low proof old school sherried scotch that I've tried. A bit weak on the palate, but the nose can perfume an entire room.

Review #227 - Single Malts of Scotland Reserve Casks Clynelish 10 Year,29,1awemcq,https://i.redd.it/3flm9mbihyjc1.jpeg,1708528871,,"[{'body': ""**Review #227 - Single Malts of Scotland Reserve Casks Clynelish 10 Year**\r  \n\r  \nElixir's 'Single Malts of Scotland' range encompasses quite a few different distilleries - here's one that's quite popular with the enthusiasts. Clynelish has classic Highland character when bottled naturally and with enough age, but that's becoming harder and harder to find these days, especially if you want a reasonable price.\r  \n\r  \nDiageo has reduced the amount of the distillate from Clynelish that's available to independent bottlers in recent years, and due to some deep cleaning and other changes at the distillery itself, some will say that the character of the malt has been lost, at least diminished.\r  \n\r  \nThis bottle from Elixir has a 10 year age statement, and we get a nice strength of 48%, above the 46% minimum that a lot of enthusiasts are looking for these days. A vatting of only three ex-bourbon casks with a 2011 vintage, there are likely fewer than 1,000 bottles of this specific blend available, but it still comes with a reasonable price.\r  \n\r  \n**Single Malts of Scotland Reserve Casks Clynelish 10 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 79 (2023)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 79 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 48% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: 3 ex-bourbon casks\r  \n**Details**: 2011 vintage, bottled in 2021; parcel no.1\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 5 months; bottles at 100%, 70% (blind tasting), and 60% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review.

Light fruits are sprinkled in: peach, nectarine, apple, maybe some pineapple. There's a soft heather note which develops into a stronger floral perfume note later, and a bit of spirity influence is still present.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A medium-thick mouthfeel; honey, soft wax, Belgian waffles, and honey-drizzled pineapples to start. There's soft fruit like nectarine, lime, apple, and guava; dry vanilla and soft oak come in later. There's more of a youthful note on the palate, at times adding a hint of acetone. At the end of the palate, more floral perfume.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, and sweet again - honey syrup, brown sugar cookies, vanilla, and honeycomb. It does have a nice waxy note, and there's a fizzy spice of white pepper and oak. We end with hints of fruit and malt, maybe the tiniest bit of smoke.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This has more of a classic Clynelish character to it - not strongly waxy, but it's getting there. Lots of sweet flavors, and the tropical fruits on the nose and palate were nice, but there's a youthful element on the palate that holds this back just a little bit.

Review #226 - New Riff Silver Grove,65,1avjxwy,https://i.redd.it/jrcgbt6zarjc1.jpeg,1708441925,,"[{'body': ""**Review #226 - New Riff Silver Grove**\n\nNew Riff's first ever barrel proof bourbon that isn't a single barrel - this is Silver Grove. Jay Erisman, one of the founders of New Riff, described in a tasting we attended last summer that the Silver Grove name comes from an old bottling of bourbon from the 1930s - part of the greater Newport/Cincinnati area's somewhat forgotten history of distilling. \n\nThis bourbon employs a slightly unusual mashbill containing 65% corn, 30% malted rye, and 5% malted barley. The distillery's products are often a bit spicy with their rye heavy mashbills - will the malting process successfully add a softness to this bourbon?\n\nThis bottle comes in at 56.8% ABV (113.5 proof), and like all of New Riff's whiskies, this is not chill filtered.\n\n**New Riff Silver Grove**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 56 (2023)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 56 (2024)\n\n**Age Statement**: 4 Years\n\n**Strength**: 56.8% ABV\n\n**Details**: Not chill filtered; mashbill of 65% corn, 30% malted rye, 5% malted barley\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 6 months; bottles at 30%, 90%, and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Subtle at first, but with time, rich and decently oak - nutmeg, pepper, and nutty flavors add a spice. There's also sweetness from brown sugar, oranges, and even a hint of mango; the softest savory notes can occasionally be found. Overall, somewhat dry, leaning a bit spicy.\n\n**Palate**: More sweet on the palate - caramel, dark red fruit, icing sugar, and warm cinnamon. There's still some spice, like pepper, an herbal rye kick, a hint of nutty character, and some anise. Oak is again strong, with wood tannins and spice... the mouthfeel is medium-thick.\n\n**Finish**: Tons of baking notes - vanilla, cinnamon, clove, anise, and refined sugar. Oak is still strong but becomes sweeter, and we get hints of red fruit and raw rye grain in the aftertaste.\n\n**Final Note**: A very solid bourbon which benefited greatly from a lot of resting time in the glass. While the nose was more dry, the palate became sweeter, a trend which continued into the finish. A classic young yet oaky bourbon, and with that proof point, a solid mouthfeel and oily character. Value is good, too - New Riff maintains their very reasonable pricing model.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 7.0 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\n\n**Value Rating**: 7.32\n\n**About Us**: We're a husband and wife review team living in the Midwest United States.

Review #225 - Balblair 1990 2nd Release (2015),31,1aupysx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1aupysx,1708356570,,"[{'body': ""**Review #225 - Balblair 1990 2nd Release (2015)**\r  \n\r  \nAh, the old vintage releases from Balblair. Generally going as far back as the 1970s (there were just a few very rare 1960s bottlings), and going through the mid-2000s, these often lacked an age statement - the best of them were instead known by the year of distillation. Balblair has moved away from the model, with their current range displaying some of the typical age statements for Scotch: 12 years, 15 years, 18 years, etc.\r  \n\r  \nWe don't have an official age statement on this bottle, but based on a vintage of 1990 and a bottling year of 2015, we can surmise that this whisky is 24 or 25 years old. It spent that time maturing in ex-bourbon casks and ex-sherry butts, and it came with a gorgeous color and a subtly fanciful bottle design.\r  \n\r  \n**Balblair 1990 2nd Release (2015)**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 279 (2024 - based on recent auction results)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 24 to 25 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon casks and ex-sherry butts\r  \n**Details**: 1990 vintage, bottled in 2015\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 5 months; bottles at 80%, 70%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Just slightly subtle at first, but it opens up to be rich and juicy. Sweet red fruits of overripe strawberry, cranberry, and plum; baking notes of cardamom and caramelized sugar; a bit of old school sherry cask, or some dunnage funk. Later, dark demerara sugar and old polished oak waft forward.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium mouthfeel or so, with a dark complexion: dense, dirty sherry, dark chocolate, cocoa nibs; some strawberry, medicinal cherry, rhubarb, and pomegranate; soft spice of black pepper can be found. Soft malty flavors and earthy notes come later, and near the end of the palate, a sweet perfumed oak arrives.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length - sweet, rounded, and rich. Cranberry, tart cherry, and cherry pie continue the fruit theme, while dark brown sugar, dark chocolate, and malt add a baking side. Again, the soft, sweet, perfumed oak arrives at the end, subtle but noticeable each time.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: So rich and pure, but it's almost hard to describe what elevates this over some other sherry bombs. It's generally sweet, but it still feels well balanced, and there's definitely a more 'old school' feeling about the spirit and the casks. So much rich, juicy red fruit - this was a real treat.\r  \n\r  \nBecause it was a limited bottling, and we're going on 10 years since the release, auction prices aren't always as palatable as the whisky itself; these vintage Balblairs have a bit of a reputation, and that's making it less affordable to snag a bottle.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 8.7 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #224 - Lagavulin 11 Year Offerman Edition - Charred Oak Cask,59,1asb4bw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1asb4bw,1708096804,,"[{'body': ""**Review #224 - Lagavulin 11 Year Offerman Edition - Charred Oak Cask**\r  \n\r  \nHis love of the Lagavulin brand is well known - Nick Offerman's association with this Islay south coast distillery began with the television show 'Parks and Recreation,' although he had been enjoying this heavily peated whisky for some time before that. The bond between Offerman, the show, and Lagavulin whisky became strong enough that Nick's character actually visited the distillery in a storyline in the show at one point.\r  \n\r  \nLagavulin's official collaboration with Nick Offerman then began with a 2019 bottling of 11 year old Lagavulin - no exotic cask finishes, just a pure 11 year old Lagavulin. This was followed up in 2021 with a second edition, also aged for 11 years, but this time, it was finished in Guinness beer casks.\r  \n\r  \nThis bottle is the third edition of this Offerman series, and the focus this time is heavily charred casks - two types, to be specific. It's charred ex-bourbon and ex-red wine casks; apparently, this cask regimen was chosen in order to best accompany 'any medium-rare steak.' And, instead of a finish, this was a full-term maturation.\r  \n\r  \nNo matter what the goal for the flavor profile was, we're excited - Lagavulin spirit is some of our favorite distillate. We get this single malt at the preferential bottling strength of 46% ABV, so flavor should be in no short supply.\r  \n\r  \n**Lagavulin 11 Year Offerman Edition - Charred Oak Cask**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 82 (2022)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 82 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 11 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Heavily-charred ex-bourbon and ex-red wine casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 3 months; bottles at 90%, 80% (blind tasting), 70% (blind tasting), and 60% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Dark, sweet, and coastal - quite briny, with some wood smoke, musty peat smoke, and a bit of earthy wood char. Fruits across the spectrum: banana, pineapple, orange, strawberry, and prune all showed up. Seaweed and moss appear later; grapefruit, balsamic, and peppery barbecue could also be found at times. A wide ranging nose, which presented differently each time.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium mouthfeel, and medium to strong peat smoke, accented by dark oak and a hint of cigar smoke. Sweetness comes from brown sugar, lime sherbet, and hints of tropical melon, while wood smoke and charred oranges add more bitterness. Charcoal and savory notes were more subtle, but present.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, with a lot of woody notes and decent smoke lingering. Wood smoke, grass, slightly acrid oak; there are hints of vanilla, creme brulee, and gummy candies in the aftertaste. Soft hints of dusty malt at times, too.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: A very interesting whisky - quite a range of flavors to explore, but each time we tasted it, it felt well put together and somewhat cohesive. Really, it just changed a bit from week to week with more air time in the bottle. Decent balance, and while the peat smoke has good strength, it's never overwhelming.\r  \n\r  \nA good Lagavulin, then, and while the price is higher than what you would pay for a lot of single malts in the 10 to 12 year age range, this is still a decent value because of the flavor it delivers.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.4 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Spicy notes of clove, imitation vanilla, and wood char mix with sweeter scents like caramel, wood sugar, and just a hint of a dark fruit like prune. Slightly simple and grainy, and a little earthy at times.\n\n**Palate**: Decently oaky, with slightly astringent tannins, a drying mouthfeel, but also some sweeter vanilla tones. The mouthfeel is medium-thin, and it brings soft grains, sweet brown sugar, hints of pepper, and a bit of caramel; later, that soft earthy note returns, paired with more dry oak.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-short, quite soft with casual warmth and more balanced oak. Soft caramel, nutmeg, and saccharine maple syrup make up most of the flavor now; in the aftertaste, there's a hint of anise spice.\n\n**Final Note**: Nicely refined, but almost too much - it's quite soft and simple, and doesn't pack a ton of flavor. It is quite well balanced, with sweet and spice notes working in tandem, but in the end, it just lacks the more interesting flavors to take it to the next level.

Review #222 - Single Malts of Scotland Reserve Casks Linkwood 13 Year,22,1aqpl1g,https://i.redd.it/71ctumalkkic1.jpeg,1707924612,,"[{'body': ""**Review #222 - Single Malts of Scotland Reserve Casks Linkwood 13 Year**\r  \n\r  \nThese Reserve Cask bottlings from the Single Malts of Scotland (SMOS) are small batches of casks - this batch was 3 barrels in total, all of the ex-bourbon variety. A brand owned by Elixir Distillers, SMOS supposedly takes the best casks that Elixir can find, which are then often bottled as single casks, but occasionally as batch releases like this one.\r  \n\r  \nOwned by Diageo, the Linkwood distillery, from Speyside, is hard to find in OB form; most of the time, you have to search for bottles from independent bottlers. Luckily, it isn't too rare, which we're quite glad about - it's shooting up our list of favorite distilleries in the past year. Not a peaty malt, this should give us some nice fruity and malty notes, and it's at that classic teen age point that can be perfect for some single malts.\r  \n\r  \n**Single Malts of Scotland Reserve Casks Linkwood 13 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 120 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 13 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 48% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: 3 ex-bourbon casks\r  \n**Details**: 2008 vintage, bottled in 2021; parcel no.1\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 4 months; bottles at 90%, 70%, and 60% fill levels at times of review.

Oak is soft and sweet, and with time, there's more heather, honeycomb, and brown sugar.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium-thick mouthfeel, oily and waxy, a really nice texture - creamy and some honey, too. Bright fruits of lemon, peach candies, and mango, and there's spice like cardamom, nutmeg, and a hint of cinnamon. Generally on the sweeter side... cane sugar and honeycomb arrive, and there's a hint of peppery oak in the background.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Lots of honey and honeycomb, and plenty of baking notes: cinnamon, sweet vanilla, brown sugar, and starch. Soft floral notes and more waxy character combine to add an elegant element, and we have an aftertaste of dry peach.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Classic - this is just a well-executed example of an unpeated ex-bourbon single malt Scotch. It has a beautiful creamy mouthfeel, more than you'd expect for a 48% ABV whisky, and the combination of tropical fruits and pleasant baking spices creates a juicy yet elegant experience. Great waxy notes here, something that modern distillate from Diageo stablemate Clynelish can only dream of at this point.\r  \n\r  \nNot a cheap whisky, at least in our area, but value is alright - we really enjoyed this bottle a lot, and it can be worth paying for the quality.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 8.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #221 - Longrow Red 15 Year - Pinot Noir Cask Matured,37,1apwj00,https://i.redd.it/f9thinciidic1.jpeg,1707839132,,"[{'body': ""**Review #221 - Longrow Red 15 Year - Pinot Noir Cask Matured**\r  \n\r  \nThe Longrow Red series pairs heavily peated distillate with a variety of red wine casks for finishing. There have been a number of different cask types used in the past, such as Tawny Port, Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Cabernet Franc... quite a few, really. This bottle we're reviewing has the highest age statement of the bunch, as far as we can tell.\r  \n\r  \nAfter spending 11 years aging in ex-bourbon casks, this spirit was transferred to New Zealand Pinot Noir casks - fresh barriques from Grant Taylor, to be specific. Taylor has won numerous awards for Pinot Noir wine; as per usual with Springbank, then, the oak used for aging will be very high quality. A decent length of finish, too, tallying 4 additional years - how will that wine influence be balanced with the ex-bourbon casks, as well as the base spirit influence?\r  \n\r  \nAs it's a Springbank product, we know this has a high quality presentation - no chill filtration, no added color, and a solid strength of 51.4% ABV.\r  \n\r  \n**Longrow Red 15 Year - Pinot Noir Cask Matured**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Campbeltown - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 274 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 15 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 51.4% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon casks and fresh Grant Taylor Pinot Noir barriques\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added; 9,400 bottles, 2022 release\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 4 months; bottles at 90%, 60%, and 50% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Musty and savory, with red meat, funky red wine, and slightly earthy notes. The peat has medium strength, and there's more spice from peppercorns and sharp oak tannins; sweetness comes from vanilla and pomegranate. A subtle scent of mushrooms reduced in red wine permeates.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium-thick; lots of different facets to this, it's a nice mix of sweet, sour, and spice. Strong on the fruit side - strong wine cask influence with cranberry, raspberry, tannic red wine, and juicy orange; there are spices of cinnamon and pepper, too. Nice aged notes of stronger oak and leather, and a fizzy element on the back end. Medium-strong musty peat smoke.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long - the smoke begins to soften, and there's still a lot of fruit to pick through. Tart orange, pomegranate, and raspberry to start, which is backed up by spices like pepper, cardamom, and slightly nutty oak. Subtle hints of old polished oak furniture, and an aftertaste of salami and other dried meats.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is very cask-forward, probably the most cask-dominant Springbank product that we can remember tasting. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but we like a little more balance, if we're nitpicking. Otherwise, this is a very tasty Campbeltown malt - strong peat and wine casks is a famous combination for a reason... it just works. There's a nice musty, slightly umami side that elevates this bottle above some of the others in that category.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately, most any Springbank is hard to come by these days, and these special releases are even more rare. Availability is poor, and prices are generally high because of that, unless you're lucky enough to buy directly from the distillery.

Review #220 - Ardbeg Arrrrrrrdbeg!,39,1ap334l,https://i.redd.it/itpf9f1ne6ic1.jpeg,1707753064,,"[{'body': ""**Review #220 - Ardbeg Arrrrrrrdbeg!**\r  \n\r  \nThis committee release Ardbeg was bottled to celebrate the retirement of Mickey Heads, after he spent 13 years as the distillery manager. A first for Ardbeg, this single malt was fully matured in ex-rye casks, before it was bottled at 51.8% ABV.\r  \n\r  \nLike most of the Ardbeg special releases, this doesn't come with any sort of age statement; while it would be a nice piece of information, especially at the price point, peated whisky is often at its most flavorful when relatively young.\r  \n\r  \nSpeaking of price points - back in 2020, when this was released, it was closer to the start of the huge rise in prices for Ardbeg special releases, and disgruntled conversation on the topic was just beginning. We found this in 2021 at a liquor store in the US for about $180, quite a steep price; not an easy decision, but as our interest in specialty single malts was rising rapidly, it was hard for us to resist.\r  \n\r  \nAnyways, back to the whisky - due to the use of rye casks, we'll be looking for a sort of herbal or spicy element in the background of this whisky, as we expect the strong smoke will still be an overwhelming main flavor.\r  \n\r  \n**Ardbeg Arrrrrrrdbeg!**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 180 (2021)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 330 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 51.8% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-rye casks\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 15 months; bottles at 100%, 90%, 80% (blind tasting), and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Salt and earthy green peat are the two most obvious notes at first - slightly medicinal, slightly mossy, slightly herbal. Soft fruits of lemon and melon add sweetness, but spice is more the focus here: pepper, charred tobacco, ash, and anise. There's also a bit of a savory side - overcooked poultry.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel has a medium thickness; salty, peaty, oily, and a decent savory side. Again, soft lemon and green apple add some subtle sweetness, along with icing sugar, but the focus is herbal, spicy notes: toasty oak, dry rub barbecue, pepper, sharp spirit, and mild jalapeno. With time, a little more fruit is teased out - unripe banana, maybe lime. Agave, minerality, and tobacco smoke appear even later... this is quite complex and changes over time.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, sharp, and earthy. The peat is quite strong, and it's backed up by minerality, earth, pepper, anise, and some sharp citrus. Oranges and bell peppers add a slightly juicy dimension, while there's the tiniest hint of oak prickle at the end.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: That rye cask influence was quite subtle in our experience - this drank like an ex-bourbon Ardbeg, with just hints of herbal notes from time to time. The biggest difference was the spice, as this was quite a dry whisky overall, with lots of pepper and anise. Quite salty and peaty, as you expect with the distillery - a solid, tasty whisky, if a little unremarkable.\r  \n\r  \nBecause this release is several years old now, and it was relatively limited, prices for it are now quite a bit higher. Auction prices have softened as a whole recently, but if you're looking to buy a bottle that's available today, it's still going to be well over the original suggested retail price.

Soft spices of cinnamon and black pepper can be found, and there's a soft herbal side, too - more of that mint and peppermint.\n\n**Palate**: A medium-thick mouthfeel, and again, it's a juxtaposition between sweet and herbal spice. Caramel corn, hard butterscotch candies, oranges, and cinnamon bring the sweeter side, while effervescent rye spice, pepper, and peppermint balance it. There's mild oak, which is nicely rounded, not too sharp.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length or so - smooth caramel, canned corn, butterscotch, quite candied overall. Vanilla and peppermint linger in the aftertaste.\n\n**Final Note**: Simple and ridiculously sweet, but quite a fun sipper. It's very pleasant and caramel-forward, and that minty fizz in the background reminds us that this is indeed a rye.

Soft sweetness comes from brown sugar, but this generally leans dry; there are hints of nutty character and a chemical note like highlighter markers; a little bit simple.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The medium mouthfeel comes with stronger sherry notes of red and orange fruit, nutty spice, clove, and black pepper; it's still leaning dry rather than sweet. Slightly more sour wood and brown sugar arrive later.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, with hints of oil and syrupy raisin. Soft oak astringency, pomegranate, mulled wine, and dry prunes make up the remaining flavors.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: We like that this isn't too sweet, which is an occasional issue with whiskies that use strong sherry maturation; the nutty character coming from the Oloroso casks was subtle, but a nice treat.

Ardbeg's own website claims that this is the smokiest Ardbeg in the range.\r  \n\r  \nThis is aged in ex-bourbon casks and ex-sherry casks - Oloroso sherry, to be specific.

There's a nice savory element as well - saucy, just a hint of funk.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A lot of peppery peat - spicy, spirity, hot peppers, and dry oak. The complexion is generally light, with bits of ashy wood fire, baked bread, salt, and green bell peppers all plentiful; orange fruit, cinnamon, and a sweet barbecue sauce zing arrive in time. Later in the palate, the smoke becomes a little more medicinal; the mouthfeel has a medium thickness with some oily texture.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, with smoke as the largest flavor in the finish. There's a hint of oaky astringency again, and the spice continues with lots of pepper and hints of tobacco in the smoke. Softer flavors of lime soda, sweet lemon, and bell pepper can occasionally be found.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This impressed us quite a bit for the age and price point. It's definitely a bit of a raw, spicy experience, but if you're looking for a big smack of peat for a relative bargain price, look no further than this.

Review #216 - Kilchoman 100% Islay 8th Edition (2018),46,1akd6lp,https://i.redd.it/xj35ill7nzgc1.jpeg,1707235352,,"[{'body': ""**Review #216 - Kilchoman 100% Islay 8th Edition (2018)**\r  \n\r  \nThe premise of Kilchoman's 100% Islay editions revolves around Islay-grown barley - specifically, this is from the distillery's own farm. In fact, they take the self-contained production process a step further - this is grown, malted, fermented, distilled, aged, and bottled all at the distillery and its farm. A true barley-to-bottle single malt.\r  \n\r  \nThis whisky isn't age stated, but based on the batch information given on the tag, we can surmise that the whisky in the bottle ranges from 5 to 10 years old, based on vintages from 2008 to 2012, and a 2018 bottling year. It is a blend of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks, with a heavier emphasis on the bourbon side, which could help highlight the flavor of the peaty base spirit.\r  \n\r  \n**Kilchoman 100% Islay 8th Edition (2018)**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 105 (2021)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 120 (2024 - current bottling)\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 50% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: 23 bourbon barrels, 7 Oloroso sherry butts\r  \n**Details**: 8th Edition; 12,000 bottle release; not chill filtered, no color added; distilled between 2008 and 2012; Optic barley variety\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 15 months; bottles at 90%, 80%, 70%, and 50% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Strong peat and funk is the theme. Rich coastal peat, like a barbecue on the beach, and a decent brine influence; farmyard funk, moldy stone fruits like nectarine, and some moss add to the spirit character. Sharper notes comes from lemon and orange citrus, as well as ash in the smoke, but it's balanced by sweeter flavors of cream, custard, and a breadiness. There's a bit more grunge in the spirit, with minerality and machine oil coming later.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Malty, oily, with a decent amount of sharp flavors: white pepper, black pepper, dry oak, and sharp spirit. The peat level is medium, maybe building up toward strong smokiness, and it comes with a vegetal, damp hay sort of funk. Orange and lemon curd add a fruit aspect, and there's cream soda, anise, a buttery medium mouthfeel, and seaweed all adding more dimensions and texture.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, and the smoke is the flavor that lingers the longest. A bit of sharp lemon, ash, and dry tannins add spice, while lime, sparkling soda, and other green fruits add a balanced sweetness. Later, peach and other stone fruit grow stronger.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Very good whisky, which takes a long time to open up.

Review #215 - Glenfiddich 15 Year Unique Solera Reserve,22,1ajjlaw,https://i.redd.it/zami6a7mfsgc1.jpeg,1707148049,,"[{'body': ""**Review #215 - Glenfiddich 15 Year Unique Solera Reserve**\r  \n\r  \nUsing a 'Solera' vat, Glenfiddich maintains consistency for its 15 year old single malt via a sort of in-house blending process. Actually, the Solera system as it's known in the sherry world generally consists of layers of casks which are partially filled and drained in succession, with the casks on the lowest level containing the oldest wine.\r  \n\r  \nGlenfiddich's system instead employs a large oak vat in which single malt already aged for 15 years is added, and then half is drained for bottling; the process repeats over time, incrementally increasing the theoretical average age of the contents in the vat. Actually, since the vat is larger than 700 liters in volume, which is the largest vessel allowed by the SWA for aging, the time the whisky spends in the vat does not actually count for additional aging for the age statement. Glenfiddich's solera vat hasn't been emptied since 1998, which should definitely add some flavor consistency to the product over a long period.\r  \n\r  \nGlenfiddich's 15 year Solera single malt has undergone a couple of subtle rebrands, most recently changing from this 'Unique Solera Reserve' to 'Our Solera Fifteen.' We're tasting the former version - we believe it was bottled in the late 2010s.\r  \n\r  \n**Glenfiddich 15 Year Unique Solera Reserve**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 75 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 15 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 40% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: European oak ex-sherry casks, new oak casks, Solera vat\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 16 months; bottles at 90%, 50% (blind tasting), 30%, and 20% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Sweet red fruits - strawberry, orange, hints of raisin and plum. There are lighter notes that suggest ex-bourbon aging, like pear, vanilla, and some sweeter baking spices; brown sugar, white grape, and barley sugar continue the sweet notes. Generally quite mellow.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium-thin; the taste reflects the nose quite well. Mellow dark fruits like grape, some orange and grapefruit, a bit of soft oak. There is a bit more spice and baking flavor on the palate, though, with stronger cinnamon, clove, cardamom, and pancakes with maple syrup.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Casual warmth, quite sweet, and medium-short in length. Hints of oak tannins add a soft spice, but this is mostly full of molasses, white wine, orange slices, and a soft grainy character.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Quite soft and almost too homogenized - the solera process seems to be working to maintain a consistent flavor profile, but it removes the possibility of an interesting whisky with the soft base distillate and the cask recipe. The bottling strength isn't doing it any favors, either - it's all a bit anemic. Still, the flavors are pleasant enough for sipping... it isn't likely to upset many people.\r  \n\r  \nValue for a 15 year age-stated whisky is pretty good, as most brands are now approaching the $100 mark in our area, but value for the flavor provided is quite average.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 6.3 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

It takes distillate from at least three sources - Kentucky, Indiana, and Tennessee - and after the initial aging in new charred American white oak barrels, we move to the finishing process.\n\nThese finishes are all virgin oak barrels, and include Mizunara, which might add a slight sandalwood or coconut flavor; French oak, which tends to add some spice; and toasted American oak, which could add more toasty oak notes and some sweeter vanilla or coconut.\n\nWe specifically have batch 3 of the Vantage product, which comes with a strength of 57.31% ABV.\n\n**Barrell Vantage**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 79 (2023)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 79 (2024)\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 57.31% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: Finished is Mizunara oak, French oak, and toasted American oak casks\n\n**Details**: Distilled in Indiana, Tennessee, and Kentucky; batch 3\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 3 months; bottles at 100%, 80% (blind tasting), and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Richly oaked - as you might expect, a lot of wood notes. Toasty, wood sugar, nutmeg, barbecued wood, and pepper all waft off of the glass; there are just little hints of orange fruit and tart nectarine in there, too. With time, much more dusty and grainy character comes forward, with peanut shells, starchy sweetness, and clove.\n\n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is thick, with quite a bit of spice and heat. Oaky, tannic, bitter dark chocolate, and black pepper; buttered popcorn, burnt sugar, cinnamon, and clove. In the mid palate, a nutty character develops, like candied pecans, and there's a bit more sweetness on the back end, like caramel and oranges.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-long, warming, and oaky. There's a hint of wood smoke now alongside the wood tannins and bitter burnt sugar; slightly more one-dimensional in the finish, although we found hints of orange pith, salt, and butterscotch in the aftertaste.\n\n**Final Note**: The oak influence is heavy, of course, but it's all a little bit simpler than we expected. Not bad, but lacking some complexity and refinement to elevate it to the next level.

Review #212 - Kilkerran 12 Year,65,1aflqnx,https://i.redd.it/t3kxjh2uxsfc1.jpeg,1706718327,,"[{'body': ""Thanks for sharing the bottling date! I really appreciate that on whisky reviews. I have a bottle from that same batch, but I haven't opened it yet because I'm working on a Kilkerran 16 at the moment. I believe Kilkerran 12 is a vatting of 70% bourbon cask and 30% sherry cask (a little less sherry than Springbank 10, which is 40%)."", 'score': 6}, {'body': ""**Review #212 - Kilkerran 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \nGlengyle, a relatively young distillery which began operations in 2004, produces lightly-peated spirit (for the most part), which they release as an 8 year old (at cask strength), a 12 year old, and a 16 year old. In addition to the age-stated releases, there are also batches of heavily peated single malt coming out regularly.\r  \n\r  \nActually, the history of the distillery goes back further than that: the original Glengyle was built in Campbeltown in 1872, and it operated until it 1925, when it was closed down. Glengyle brands their single malt range as Kilkerran, as the naming rights for the Glengyle brands are not actually held by the current distillery and its owners.\r  \n\r  \nThis sister distillery of Springbank is quite small, with a theoretical capacity of 750,000 lpa, but they only produce around 100,000 lpa in actuality. The distillery is only operated for about three months at the end of the year; it shares much of its production team with Springbank, which is operated roughly from January through September.\r  \n\r  \nConcerning the maturation on this 12 year old bottle - it's generally a mixture of ex-bourbon casks and ex-sherry casks. We're not sure of the exact ratio on our batch, but generally, it will lean a bit more toward the ex-bourbon side - that was in line with our experience.\r  \n\r  \n**Kilkerran 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Campbeltown - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 82 (2022)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 86 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added; June 2021 batch\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 5 times over 12 months; bottles at 100%, 80%, 70% (blind tasting), 60% (blind tasting), and 40% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Some classic ex-bourbon notes like vanilla, soft oak, cinnamon, and honeydew melon; behind that, there's a slightly vegetal backbone, with soft smoke, moss, oil, and a musty smell. It's somewhat soft overall, though; with more time, peppercorns, hints of perfume and flowers, hay, and a hint of salt appear.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Solid spirt, with some malt and sweet grain flavors, and the peat smoke grows from soft to almost a medium level. Little hints of funk, musty cellar, and perfume can be found, but the focus is light fruits and baking spice: green apple, lemon drop candy, vanilla, cream, and brown sugar. The mouthfeel has a medium thickness.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, with hints of smoke and funky malt. Soft flavors of lime, green apples, honey, and flowers are the focus now, with an aftertaste including pear, lemon zest, buttery oak, and custard.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: A bit subtle and delicate, especially soft on the nose - there are nice flavors here, but the whole experienced was just a bit muted and plain in its delivery. The base spirit seemed to be strong, and the addition of a soft peat influence and subtle funky flavors was nice; the custard and malt notes were a treat, but it all just needed a bit more strength.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately for us in the US, at least in some regions, the pricing for Campbeltown whiskies has been driven up due to high demand and the reputation of these distilleries. While it's still a bit cheaper and easier to find than Springbank, these Kilkerran whiskies are known as high quality single malts, so they aren't cheap; value, then is just average.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 6.7 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

We don't think that's totally fair - expensive whisky is worse value, but there's still some value to be found in those high quality flavors.\n\nThe formula we use is:\n\n\\[Value\\] = \\[Score\\] \\* 4 / ( \\[Price\\] \\^ (1/3) )\n\nThe equation without the factor of 4 was generally yielding values between 0 and 2.5, so we just scaled it up by 4 to make it a 0-10 scale for ease of use.\n\nThe value we give won't always match that equation exactly based on the price we give in our review - we give a value rating in our own personal spreadsheet based on the score for each individual tasting session, and then average it at the end.

After mixing a large sample of the two, we let the blend marry together for a few days before the first tasting.\n\nBased on the 46.5% ABV of 1910 and the 57.5% ABV of 1920, we get a final strength of 52% for the blend, a nice middle ground. The 1920 should add a nice heat, while 1910 will bring some stronger oak notes due to its double-oaked maturation; since they\'re produced at the same distillery, we\'re hoping the distillate will blend together somewhat seamlessly.\n\n**Old Forester ""1915""**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 56 (Average of the two bottle prices)\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 52% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 2 months; bottles at 100%, 30%, and 20% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Rich and dessert-like: syrupy cherries, bananas, chocolate syrup, sweet caramel apple, and brown sugar. There\'s a hint of white pepper and maple from the oak, which grows stronger with time; later, even more sweet scents, like raw sugar, tiramisu, and molasses.\n\n**Palate**: Velvety consistency, a medium-thick mouthfeel. Some warmth builds, along with oak tannins and peppery heat, but the sweet flavors are still the star: cinnamon rolls, brown sugar, molasses, and chocolate. After airing out for a while, a slightly nutty side appears, with nutmeg and more pepper.\n\n**Finish**: Lingering notes of chocolate syrup, cherry, butterscotch, and salted caramel - a serious sugar bomb. Again, oak adds a tickle of spice like white pepper and dry tannins, but the main focus is dessert flavors. Cheap chocolate milk and stronger oak make up the aftertaste.\n\n**Final Note**: Better than the sum of its parts, which isn\'t always the case with blends; in fact, we would say that usually isn\'t the case. This nicely meshes the strength of the 1920 with the oakiness and dessert flavors of the 1910, creating a whisky that\'s better than either one individually. Because the prices of both bottles are somewhat reasonable, this gets quite a good value rating, too - a great little experiment, and a strong recommendation to try if you happen to have both bottles.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 7.1 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we\'ve added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #210 - Loch Lomond 18 Year,43,1adyg1q,https://i.redd.it/67ag0b5rhefc1.jpeg,1706543426,,"[{'body': ""**Review #210 - Loch Lomond 18 Year**\r  \n\r  \nOne of the most reasonably priced 18 year old Scotch whiskies - this single malt is priced more like a blend of an equivalent age. Loch Lomond is known for their affordability, while still presenting quality spirits.\r  \n\r  \nThere isn't a lot of information about the specific types of casks used to mature this 18 year whisky - the bottle only states 'American oak,' and our bottle is from 2019, before the most recent rebrand. On the brand's website, they state that the current version of the 18 year old uses three types of American oak casks, but still don't add further detail; because of that, we don't have any certain flavor expectations going into the review.\r  \n\r  \nThis is presented at a pleasant 46% strength, meaning no chill filtration is necessary to avoid the clouding effect under cold temperatures - indeed, they state on the label that it's not chill filtered. Loch Lomond Group has still been known to add a little bit of artificial coloring to their whiskies in recent years, but they seem to be moving toward more natural presentation - hopefully that trend continues.\r  \n\r  \n**Loch Lomond 18 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 80 (2021)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 95 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 18 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: American oak casks\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 5 times over 2 years; bottles at 100%, 90%, 80% (blind tasting), 70%, and 50% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Slight funk and hints of peat, with a little earthy side and some herbal notes. Still a bit spirity for an 18 year old, but somewhat mellow overall; oak is light and drying, and there are hints of prune, raisin, and plum sauce. With time, soft barbecue and minerality come forward, along with light fruit and brown sugar.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A medium mouthfeel, with a mixture of oak, fruit, and other spice flavors. That tickle of peat from the nose arrives in the palate, and it's aided by dry wood spice, clove, and soft pepper. There's a bouquet of orchard fruits: red apple, orange, crisp pear, banana, lemon, and nectarine all appeared across our various tastings. With time, a bit more acidity or astringency from the oak is present.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, with a pleasant warmth and a more measured oak influence; the astringency has dissipated. The soft peat smoke is still present, and it's balanced by sweeter notes of grape soda, brandy, and vanilla; in the aftertaste, occasional flavors of minerality, savory orange, and flowers can be found.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: There are decent flavors here, and some nice complexity on the palate, but the overall strength of flavor is what stops this from scoring higher - it was nice, but quite mild during each tasting. There's aren't a lot of mature wood notes for an 18 year old whisky, either, but nothing about it was offensive.

Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Somewhat sweet, grain forward, and a little bit oaky - caramel, brown sugar, molasses, and vanilla make up the sweet side, while a little bit of astringency and tannins add a spice. Hints of barley sugar, a whiff of cherry fruit, and peppercorns make up the remaining flavors.\n\n**Palate**: Peppery and sharp, oaky, and a little hot for its strength. The mouthfeel is medium-thin, and it's bringing wood tannins, sweetness from caramel and butterscotch, strawberry preserve, sour cherry, and a hint of an earthy effervescence.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-short in length, trails off a bit with some herbal spice, lighter sugar flavors, some grain, and a bit of barrel char.\n\n**Final Note**: A bit simple, and the slightly chemical effervescent flavor that gained some strength in the palate and lingered into the finish wasn't our favorite flavor. This stuck mostly to the grainy baking spice and oak flavors, with just occasional fruit notes adding another dimension; because the price is reasonable, it isn't the worst value, but it isn't a huge recommendation from us.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 4.3 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

The peat is mild, building toward medium, and the smoke is accented by mushrooms, sassafras, and charcoal. Hints of malt and spirit notes are here, and we get some baking spices like cinnamon and nutmeg; fruits like orange, prune, and tart fig are hidden beneath. The mouthfeel is medium at most; quite complex overall.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length, decent richness, and mostly dark flavors: dirty roots, dunnage funk, grape, plum, cola, and milk chocolate.

Some will grieve the move away from the old vintage-stated bottles, but the distillery still seems to be committed to quality.\r  \n\r  \nThis is aged in both ex-bourbon casks and American oak 'double-fired' casks; because of that, we're expecting some sweeter, classic baking-spice flavors.

With time, orange and some tropical melon add more fruit dimensions, and ginger adds some spice.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel has a medium thickness; there's a nice maturity to the oak, adding dry spice and a hint of leather, but the main focus is fruits: peaches, strong tart lemon, and some other tropical fruit.

The spirit flavors and cask flavors have a nice balance, and the predominant ex-bourbon notes give us plenty of fruits and baking spices.

Review #206 - Deanston 15 Year Organic,43,19cxtgm,https://i.redd.it/q25mlb7qc0ec1.jpeg,1705936387,,"[{'body': ""**Review #206 - Deanston 15 Year Organic**\r  \n\r  \nThis Deanston spent 15 years maturing in a 'selection of oak casks,' generally thought to be American oak casks, or ex-bourbon casks. Because this is a Deanston product, it's presented above 46% ABV, and we don't have to worry about any added color or chill filtration.\r  \n\r  \nOrganic whisky is actually quite a challenging product to make. For a whisky to be truly organic, the entire production process has to be changed and regulated:\r  \n\r  \n\\- The barley used must be organically grown, meaning no pesticides or other commercial chemicals\r  \n\\- The malting process must be done in a clean area without residue from non-organic malted barley\r  \n\\- The mash tun, fermenting vessels, and stills all must be thoroughly cleaned to avoid contact with previous contents that were not organic\r  \n\\- The casks used for aging, including their previous contents, must all be certified as organic to avoid contamination\r  \n\r  \nThere's more complexity to it than that, but that's a basic outline of a few of the major differences.\r  \n\r  \nBecause of the additional time spent cleaning, the additional cost of materials, and the lost time when other spirit runs are not being done, it's generally quite an expensive and cumbersome process to create organic whiskies. Deanston has shown some commitment to it, though - they have a number of releases with an 'organic' certification, including a 14 year old, a couple of 15 year olds, and some vintage releases from 2000, 2001, and 2002.\r  \n\r  \n**Deanston 15 Year Organic**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 80 (2023)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 80 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 15 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46.3% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: American oak casks\r  \n**Details**: Organic; not chill filtered, no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 4 months; bottles at 100% (blind tasting), 80% (blind tasting), and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: A bit reserved and muted at first - takes time to open up. With that time, a mix of fruit and sweet malty flavors arrive: pear, dried apricot, caramel apples, and orange rind are balanced by mature, perfumed oak, clove, dry vanilla, and dusty malt. There are little hints of coffee and milk chocolate wafting around.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Balanced, if a bit mild: sweet stone fruit like poached apricot and peaches, pear and honey, but also perfumed wood and cardamom. Grows sweeter with time, adding orange juice, brown sugar, vanilla, and heather; the mouthfeel is medium.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, with malt, velvety honey, oats, and cinnamon. Dry vanilla and peppercorns add to the spice side, while orchard fruit and grainy sugar add sweetness. Again, there's some nicely mature oak in here, but all of the flavors are a bit soft, and they take time to appear.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This definitely needed time to open up; it's pleasant, but the flavors are reserved and subtle. There's nice sweetness and malty character, and the perfumed oak shows more age than the 15 years would suggest at first glance.

A typical small batch bourbon with a strength of 46% ABV (92 proof) - there's no age statement here, and not a lot of other detail on the bottle.\n\nThe rights to the brand were acquired with the Old Fitzgerald brand by Heaven Hill in the 1990s; this product didn't come to market until the 2010s, though. The distillery doesn't disclose the mashbill, but based on the fact that wheat is the second largest grain ingredient, we're expecting a softer, more mellow bourbon experience.\n\n**Larceny Small Batch Bourbon**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 26 (2024)\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 46% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 6 months; bottles at 100%, 80%, and 40% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review.

We found straw, dusty grain, freeze-dried strawberries, and a little bit of a salted almond taste; later, more spice like clove, nutmeg, and wood spice.\n\n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium-thin; decent sweet notes like caramel, vanilla, and a hint of cherry, but stronger spice notes of clove, nutmeg, salted pretzel, and dusty oak. Tart apple and licorice candies add a slightly bitter dimension; the oak influence is pretty dry.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-short, with simple, standard bourbon flavors: brown sugar, mild oak, vanilla, a bit of nutmeg. It's all a bit easy, bordering on bland.\n\n**Final Note**: Never unpleasant, but maybe a little too safe - it's typical to the point of being a bit boring. There's not much of a spice element, and while it isn't overly sweet, the drying character isn't enough to keep it interesting.

Review #204 - Lagavulin Distiller's Edition,73,199s2zi,https://i.redd.it/noyd8n10r7dc1.jpeg,1705590088,,"[{'body': ""**Review #204 - Lagavulin Distiller's Edition**\r  \n\r  \nLike a number of the Diageo distilleries that have a core range, Lagavulin releases an annual 'Distiller's Edition' single malt. This generally incorporates an additional finishing cask into the maturation process; in this case, it's Pedro Ximenez-seasoned sherry casks, on top of the usual American and European oak casks. This was first released in the late 1990s, and previously had an age statement; new editions continue to be released.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately, this doesn't come with a higher strength than Lagavulin's usual releases - this is still bottled at 43% ABV. Lagavulin's famous 16 Year Old whisky already has some amount of sherry cask maturation involved - how will this additional PX finish change the final product?\r  \n\r  \n**Lagavulin Distiller's Edition**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 126 (2023)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 126 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Refill American and European oak casks, recharred PX cask finish\r  \n**Details**: 2022 release\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 3 months; bottles at 70%, 60%, and 50% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Rubbery and musty - the smoke can be smelled a few feet away. Despite that, this is a bit restrained when you dig in - sweet red fruit likes cherries or other berries, mild orange, a slightly mossy character, a bit of wood smoke with the peat. The complexion is dark, and after a few minutes, the peat is more of a mild to medium strength.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium-thin; the peat level is medium, and it's still musty, maybe slightly woody. Fruits arrive in the form of orange, cranberry, and other red berries, while darker flavors like brown sugar sit in the background. The smoke takes a slightly sharp and ashy character; overall, still a bit restrained, and lacking a bit of 'oomph.'\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Lots of orange and blood orange, with just hints of mild red fruit; it's a bit tangy, with some chocolate on the back end. The smoke is still medium, but quickly trails off to a mild influence, and there are just hints of brown sugar sweetness and wood smoke. It's a medium length finish.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Pleasant enough to drink, with a nice fruity character coming from those casks; the smokiness is a bit mild for a Lagavulin, a standard which is already milder than that of Islay south coast siblings Laphroaig and Ardbeg. The flavor is there, but just isn't delivered with any punchiness - the strength is definitely lacking, which forces this to be more restrained and subtle.\r  \n\r  \nWe settled on a rating of 6.5 out of 10, but if we were framing this score based on our expectations of a PX-matured Lagavulin, it would be more like a 4 out of 10 compared to what we hoped for. And because this is a 'special release' Diageo product, the pricing isn't favorable - we think this is too expensive for the flavor you get.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 6.5 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

They were both very good, I would say better than the traditional 16 if you have a preference for heavier sherry, which I do. You mention it is a little too subtle for the palate with the lack of abv, and I tend to agree with this statement, but I also think simultaneously it can be a little bit of a softer more refined smoky experience. People in here saying what if it was 50% abv plus or this or that. I agree this could be exceptional at a few abv points higher but I don’t think this dram is about that, that’s not this drams intention. It’s not an ardbeg oggy, it’s not the brash young in your face youngish spirit barnyard funky wet sherry kilchoman Sanaig, this is a much more softer refined experience, you don’t come here for a slap in the face, you come to this dram for a softer, refined, interesting balanced whisky. Which I think this is. Also an incredible shame about the lack of age statements on all distillers editions across the range. Diageo really doubles down on ridiculous things, I wonder how much younger they are going with this, it traditionally was 15/16 minimum age, maybe they are pulling some 11-16 year barrels and nothing older and gradually getting slightly younger. The price has crept up too which is a disaster for all lagavulin products. But I still think the following is true, if this is mostly 14-16 age whisky from islay, where can you get an islay aged for around 15 years that has the refined quality that this dram delivers. I think we have become spoiled for choice over the years and everyone all the time scoffs at anything that doesn’t have the age abv or natural colour wording but plenty of whisky’s are still wonderful without one or a few of those 3 talking points. Islay scotch has become expensive, esp the big brands. Having said that look at what the new rumoured cost of kilchoman is going to be for the new 15 or 16 year old, over 200 easily. It won’t be just lagavulin taking the piss, everyone slowly wants a piece of the pie. We should all be thankful that today in history we have access to more whisky than any other period in history.

It takes the European oak ex-sherry casks and American oak ex-sherry casks from the Double Cask version, and then adds some American oak ex-bourbon casks to the mix.\r  \n\r  \nBefore we even taste this, we can see that this whisky suffers from the same presentation as the other 12 year Macallans: bottling strength is only 43% ABV, which means chill filtration is also very likely.

There's a bit of mild black pepper spice and some soft oak, but the main focus is fruits - we also get oranges and sweet, jammy fruits later on. With time, hints of baked bread and eucalyptus found their ways out.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Middle of the road once again, with some sweeter notes and dry notes, but also some sherry flavors and ex-bourbon flavors. Raisins and hints of warm spice like cinnamon, some dark berries, but also a bit of vanilla and mild oak. There are just hints of that slightly dirty, sulfury Macallan spirit hidden underneath the cask influence, and the mouthfeel is medium-thin.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, leaning a bit more toward the sherry side of things now. Dark fruits of fig and blackcurrant, some orange, some cinnamon spice, and soft, buttery oak. A little simple and amorphous.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: In our market, this bottle is priced between the Sherry Oak 12 Year Old and the Double Cask 12 Year Old Macallans; to our taste buds, it's a step down from either one. Not a huge change, mind you, but noticeably more mild and slightly bland. The addition of the bourbon casks did less to add new flavors and more to dampen the sherry impact... it isn't quite what we expect from a Macallan.

Review #202 - Alexander Murray Teaninich 13 Year Single Cask,28,197bnlz,https://i.redd.it/xtmrbbs9jmcc1.jpeg,1705333245,,"[{'body': ""**Review #202 - Alexander Murray Teaninich 13 Year Single Cask**\r  \n\r  \nTeaninich is a lesser known distillery, a Diageo company that produces malt for blends. It's located in the mainland portion of the highland region, and while not a lot of its single malt makes its way into the hands of enthusiasts, it's actually quite a large-scale production: 10.2 million liters of alcohol per annum, placing it comfortably in the top 10 largest malt distilleries in Scotland.\r  \n\r  \nOne interesting feature of the Teaninich distillery is its use of a hammer mill and mash filter - this is a relatively unique setup in Scotland. Made to produce extremely clear wort before distillation, this setup first hammers the grain into extremely fine flour before mashing; after the sugars have been accessed and broken down, a series of cloth filters remove the solids from the wort before the liquid moves on to fermentation.\r  \n\r  \nThis example from Alexander Murray and Co. has been matured for 13 years in 'oak casks,' specifically a hogshead - there's no other detail concerning the cask type on the bottle, but some digging online points in the direction of an ex-bourbon hogshead. They give us a nice bottling strength of 56.4% ABV, and to go with it, a lack of chill filtration.\r  \n\r  \n**Alexander Murray Teaninich 13 Year Single Cask**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 100 (2022)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 100 (2024 - equivalent bottling)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 13 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 56.4% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon hogshead\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered; 2004 vintage, bottled in 2018; cask no. 307468, 272 bottles\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 14 months; bottles at 100%, 80% (blind tasting), 70% (blind tasting), and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Light and bright, with some sharpness - lemon citrus, dry vanilla, dry wood, and some spices like cinnamon and star anise. The fruits continue with pear and watermelon; there's a grassy character, before the scents transition to sweetness with more air time. Brown sugar, bubblegum, and sweet biscuits all can be found; there's a spirity side to this, too.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A medium-thick mouthfeel, with a bit of heat at first; there's definitely a spicy, spirity side to this. Bright, tart lemon, wood char, and a hint of sour malt add to that sharp complexion, but again, more sweetness comes with time. Pears, apples, perfume, and brown sugar arrive, and after a few months of the bottle being open, the bubblegum flavors were much stronger. On the back of the palate, spices of cinnamon, white pepper, and dry vanilla were present.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Light fruits: unripe peach, green apple skins, apple juice, and pear. Still spirity and warm, and slightly young and simple as it settles on the tongue; spice comes from wood char, cinnamon, and then there's a bit of barley sugar. The finish has a medium length overall.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: We originally bought this bottle because we wanted to try the distillery, and it came at a bit of a cost - $100, which isn't cheap, although this is a 13 year old cask strength whisky. The taste has a hard time living up to that price point, though - it isn't a bad whisky, but it's not quite living up to its age.\r  \n\r  \nThis might point to a somewhat spent refill cask, as 13 years is generally long enough to round off most of the spirit heat and youth notes, but this was still quite a raw, spirity experience. It has nice bright fruit flavors and just a hint of that grassy character that Teaninich is supposedly known for, but this needed either a bit more time to be fully polished, or a slightly more palatable price.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 6.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #200 - SMWS 53.363 'Delicious Earthy Smoke' - Caol Ila 10 Year,35,194506i,https://i.redd.it/1plxhers2ubc1.jpeg,1704988735,,"[{'body': ""**Review #200 - SMWS 53.363 'Delicious Earthy Smoke' - Caol Ila 10 Year**\r  \n\r  \nThe first bottle we ever purchased from the Scotch Malt Whisky Society - this was our introduction to independently bottled single malt, as well, due to some lack of availability in our geographical area. Because this was our first IB Scotch, as well as our gateway into a wider world of whisky that wasn't just OB core range bottles, it holds a bit of a special place in our hearts.\r  \n\r  \nIndependently bottled Caol Ila has become quite expensive in recent years, despite its relative abundance - it's become common to see well over $10 per year of aging when buying from quality bottlers. Even for cask strength whisky with no added coloring or chill filtering, that's getting pretty steep; the taste has quite a high expectation to live up to. Then again, this is said to be one of the most consistent distilleries in Scotland in terms of flavor and quality.\r  \n\r  \nThis bottling from the SMWS spent its maturation time in a refill ex-bourbon hogshead; both the refill factor and the larger cask factor should mean that we'll see plenty of spirit character, and that it won't be too cask-forward.\r  \n\r  \n**SMWS 53.363 'Delicious Earthy Smoke' - Caol Ila 10 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 135 (2021)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: No longer available\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 57.7% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Refill ex-bourbon hogshead\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added; distilled November 12, 2009; 300 bottles\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 2 years; bottles at 90%, 80%, 60%, and 30% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Peat is the most obvious - it's a mix of earthy, damp, musty, even tobacco-esque smoke. Some wood fire arrives, before we transition to savory scents: barbecue like smoked meats, charcuterie cheeses, and some orange. Sweetness from lemons and vanilla comes and goes; throughout it all, the backbone of musty peat permeates. There's charcoal, decomposing wood, moss, and agave. It's decently spirity (in a good way).\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Very oily, some decent heat from the strength, and the peat smoke is strong. The mouthfeel is medium-thick, full of sharper flavors like astringent wood, lemon citrus, black pepper, and a hint of burning rubber. The smokiness sometimes brings ash or musty flavors like smoldering damp wood, and with more time, fruits arrive: grapefruit, charred orange, and hot peppers come to mind.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is long - peat lingers all the way, quite strong at first, but it pleasantly fizzles out over time. Phenolic, salty, and a little bit drying from wood tannins; fruits again arrive late, with lemon and blood orange being the main culprits.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: A great whisky, especially if you enjoy the drier side of peated single malt. It has that classic light complexion of a Caol Ila, with the sharp lemon flavors, but also quite a strong peat level for the distillery; quite musty and mossy at times, which embodies that Islay character. This is classic ex-bourbon Islay whisky, but it does come at a cost.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.8 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #201 - Michter's 10 Year Single Barrel Bourbon,108,193dwsm,https://i.redd.it/v61bkkj2fnbc1.jpeg,1704908093,,"[{'body': ""**Review #201 - Michter's 10 Year Single Barrel Bourbon**\n\nAnother example of the many limited annual release bourbons, this is Michter's 10 Year, a Kentucky straight bourbon coming in single barrel form. This is actually a sourced product currently - Michter's is supposed to start bottling their own distillate in these 10 year releases in a few years.\n\nProof point is interesting here - unlike many of the special release bourbons, which come at barrel proof, this one is proofed down to 47.2% ABV, or 94.4 proof. Will it be able to deliver enough flavor at that strength? And, maybe more importantly, is the high price justified when there are plenty of other 10 year old bourbons readily available in the market for a fraction of the cost?\n\n**Michter's 10 Year Single Barrel Bourbon**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 185 (2024)\n\n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\n\n**Strength**: 47.2% ABV\n\n**Details**: 2023 release; barrel 23E1845\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 50% fill level at time of review. Tasted in a nosing glass, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Rich, candied, and sweet. There are hard cherry candies, strawberries, and some subtle brown sugar notes; oak influence is relatively strong, and with more time, the scents transition to leather.\n\n**Palate**: Medium mouthfeel, with nice aged notes of leather and tobacco up front. The sweetness is more subtle now; oak grows in strength, adding hints of cedar and a lumberyard. Quite mature, with a velvety texture.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-long, with those mature notes again: cigar smoke, leather, and hints of spice linger. Later on, hints of red fruit like pomegranate seeds can be found, and there's a bit of wood char in the aftertaste; overall, somewhat subtle.\n\n**Final Note**: Very tasty - this has more mature tasting notes than most 10 year old bourbons. It takes a little time to open up - it's just slightly dense and musty, but later on, you're rewarded. Richly flavored despite the proof, but also a subtle experience overall. Is it worth more than those other 10 year bourbons? Probably so, yes.

Croftengea is a heavily peated malt used by Loch Lomond primarily for blending, though occasional it finds its way out via an independent bottler, usually in single cask form.\r  \n\r  \nThe cask in question this time was a second fill ex-bourbon barrel, which could hint at some slightly more spirity flavors; the heavy peat smoke flavor might be a bit more intact, too. We get the Society's typical craft presentation with a cask strength of 57.4% ABV, and the information that this spirit comes from a 2011 vintage.\r  \n\r  \n**SMWS 122.40 'Smoky to a Tee' - Loch Lomond (Croftengea) 10 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 105 (2021)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: No longer available\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 57.4% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Second fill ex-bourbon barrel\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added; distilled February 14, 2011; 208 bottles\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 13 months; bottles at 100%, 80%, and 70% fill levels at times of review.

Sweetness arrives in the form of caramel apple candies, some sugary lemons, and a hint of vanilla bean; behind it all, there's a strong spirit character that's vegetal and damp. Wet wood, earth, tobacco smoke, fresh mulch, and moldy lemons all come to mind, along with a briny coastal character.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Lots of lemon, and the peat is pretty strong now - it takes on a bit of a seaside barbecue feeling, with that salty character and some black pepper spice. Lots of lighter orchard fruits form the top layer: dried citrus, sour green apple candies, lemon drop candies, maybe some melon at times. There are mild baking flavors: caramel and butterscotch, with a little bit of a bready flavor later. The mouthfeel is thick.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is long, with noticeable peat still lingering for some time, but the smoke isn't overwhelming at all. There are more barbecue notes: hardwood smoked bacon, char, roasted jalapenos; nice spirity warmth is accented by lots of light fruits - lemon oil, lime candies, and stronger melon flavors. The texture stays quite oily.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: One of our first strongly peated whiskies from the SMWS, and it has very good balance for a peated whisky. The second fill maturation allowed the spirit notes to come forward just enough, but it never came across as too young; the peat was strong, but restrained in the finish. The bright fruits were nice and light, adding sweetness to counteract the smoke, and that mulchy character in the nose was an interesting addition to the tasting experience.

Often you'll find the peated variety, and a little less often, this unpeated variety (or extremely lightly peated, to be accurate, but the smoke is essentially undetectable); the resulting flavors can vary quite a bit depending on the cask treatment and which bottler it comes from.\r  \n\r  \nThis bottle spent the first part of its life in an ex-bourbon hogshead, like many of the Scotch Malt Whisky Society bottlings do, before it was moved into a Heavy Toast Medium Char (HTMC) hogshead for finishing. That could add some oaky flavors to the mix, more than you might expect to find in the typical 13 year Scotch with refill aging.\r  \n\r  \n**SMWS 10.217 'Journey to the Fest' - Bunnahabhain 13 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 160 (2021)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: No longer available\r  \n**Age Statement**: 13 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 60.6% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon hogshead, finished in a refill HTMC hogshead\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added; distilled October 3, 2007; 224 bottles\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 11 months; bottles at 100%, 90%, and 80% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review.

There's a mulchy, damp, mossy side to this as well, along with fresh flowers and dark chocolate; then, more fruits of prune, grape, and tangerine. A bit of a chameleon overall - many different sides to this.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Rich and viscous with a thick mouthfeel. There's a mix of sweet and sharp spice notes - cinnamon apples, wine gums, orange, chocolate, and caramel popcorn add the sweet side, while nutmeg, oak, light roast coffee, paprika, chili, and peppercorns add the spice. With time to air out, more dark fruits of plums, raisins, and prunes arrive; the back of the palate gives us an interesting mix of Fig Newtons and savory peppered steak.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, with lots more oak and perfume. It's quite warm, but not overwhelmingly hot, and there's a nice oily character that lingers; spices comes from chili and pepper, while sweetness comes from vanilla and cinnamon sugar. In the aftertaste, there's a bit of lingering wood smoke.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Quite an interesting bottle, with very inconsistent tasting notes across our sessions with it. There's an interesting mix of fruit and baking spices throughout the experience, and the perfume and oak notes grew stronger on the palate and finish over time.

Review #196 - Blackadder Amrut Raw Cask,6,18yg5bm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18yg5bm,1704383141,,"[{'body': ""**Review #196 - Blackadder Amrut Raw Cask**\r  \n\r  \nA local tasting even last year introduced us to a range of Amrut whiskies, and this was one of the standouts: a Raw Cask bottling from Blackadder. Like all Raw Cask bottlings, this is totally unfiltered after it's drawn from the cask - there's plenty of sediment and char sitting at the bottom of the bottle.\r  \n\r  \nAmrut was actually the first distillery to produce single malt in India - it's located in Bangalore, and was founded in 1948. The name comes from Sanskrit, and can roughly be translated into 'nectar of the gods' - quite a name to live up to, then.\r  \n\r  \nThey don't tell us what type of cask this was aged in, but it does have a nice, rich natural color, as well as a mouth-watering strength of 62.1% ABV. There's no age statement, either, but we're guessing that it's relatively young, at least under 8 years old, due to the hot climate in India, where this ages.\r  \n\r  \n**Blackadder Amrut Raw Cask**\r  \n\r  \n*India - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 219 (2024)\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 62.1% ABV\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered (totally un-filtered), no color added; cask BA33-2022, 209 bottles; bottled December 2022\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 2 months; bottles at 50%, 80%, and 70% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review.

As it opens up, a very strong Chai tea spice note develops; dry oak and wood smoke come in behind that, and there's an accent flavor of leather again.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, warm but not overly hot, with lots of oak notes again. Cinnamon, tannins, wood smoke, and some sweeter brown sugar are all present; little hints of red fruit and toast waft through. Like the palate, given more time, strong Chai tea spices develop in the aftertaste.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: A raw experience with strong flavors, but the alcohol is well-integrated in the whisky despite the high strength. It's a little bit simple, with one-lane baking spice and oak flavors, but it does those quite well; that Chai note in the palate and finish is probably the strongest we've found in a whisky.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately for the value rating, despite this being a very good whisky, these limited bottlings often command a bit of a premium, and this is no exception.

Some of these mimic the casks used in single malt production in other parts of the world, especially Scotland. Here's one example: Stranahan's, out of Denver, Colorado, is using ex-Oloroso sherry casks to finish one of their single malt bottlings.\r  \n\r  \nIt's aged at least seven years, which is a solid age statement for an American single malt - makes sense, considering that Stranahan's is one of the more well-established distilleries making this spirit style.

With time, oak becomes stronger, and there's a sharp citrus fruit scent.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A medium mouthfeel, with strong malty chocolate, decent oak spices, and dark, candied red fruits. The oak is adding cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg, and we get red apples and raspberries first, before strawberry and grapefruit arrive. A bit of a fruit bomb, really; later, anise spice and some raw almond flavors can be found.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, with lots of fresh fruit: apple skins, strawberries, and tart cherry. There's a cinnamon note that almost brings a spiked apple cider flavor in combination with the fruit, and we get hints of grain and sugary vanilla later; there's still a decent malt note, and some dark oak at the end.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: A nice sipper - very solid, and very strong sherry influence with the plentiful fruits across the whole tasting experience. It still has that malty backbone that comes across strongly in a lot of American single malts, but the malty chocolate notes aren't overpowering like they can be in other whiskies.

Review #195 - Stranahan's Sherry Cask,27,18xmawl,https://i.redd.it/bg3dw0l4w8ac1.jpeg,1704296509,,"[{'body': ""**Review #195 - Stranahan's Sherry Cask**\n\nWhile many American single malts are made using traditional American casks (newly charred white oak) for aging, several distilleries are also employing different cask styles. Some of these mimic the casks used in single malt production in other parts of the world, especially Scotland. Here's one example: Stranahan's, out of Denver, Colorado, is using ex-Oloroso sherry casks to finish one of their single malt bottlings.\n\nIt's aged at least seven years, which is a solid age statement for an American single malt - makes sense, considering that Stranahan's is one of the more well-established distilleries making this spirit style. We also get a preferable ABV of 47%, above the standard/entry-level strength of 40% to 45%.\n\n**Stranahan's Sherry Cask**\n\n*USA - Single Malt*\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 79 (2024)\n\n**Age Statement**: 7 Years\n\n**Strength**: 47% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: Oloroso sherry cask finish\n\n**Details**: Batch 11\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 6 months; bottles at 100%, 70%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Very fruity - tons of red fruits like cherries, strawberries, some blood orange, and then red apple skins. There's a sweet baking component, too: chocolate, cinnamon, caramel, and a bit of malt. With time, oak becomes stronger, and there's a sharp citrus fruit scent.\n\n**Palate**: A medium mouthfeel, with strong malty chocolate, decent oak spices, and dark, candied red fruits. The oak is adding cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg, and we get red apples and raspberries first, before strawberry and grapefruit arrive. A bit of a fruit bomb, really; later, anise spice and some raw almond flavors can be found.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length, with lots of fresh fruit: apple skins, strawberries, and tart cherry. There's a cinnamon note that almost brings a spiked apple cider flavor in combination with the fruit, and we get hints of grain and sugary vanilla later; there's still a decent malt note, and some dark oak at the end.\n\n**Final Note**: A nice sipper - very solid, and very strong sherry influence with the plentiful fruits across the whole tasting experience. It still has that malty backbone that comes across strongly in a lot of American single malts, but the malty chocolate notes aren't overpowering like they can be in other whiskies. Value is alright - not the cheapest, but this product has a nice quality to it, especially if you enjoy sherry-finished whisky.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 7.0 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

It technically meets the requirements to be called a bourbon, but Jack Daniel's brands this as a Tennessee whisky, like most of their corn-heavy products.\n\nAs with all single barrel whiskies, the quality and flavors will vary at least a little bit from barrel to barrel, from bottle to bottle. That said, this product is generally thought to have a high quality floor, so we have high expectations going into the review.\n\nThese bottles are also somewhat famous for their high bottling proof - ours comes in just over the 65% mark. It's 65.1% ABV, or 130.2 proof, to be precise.\n\n**Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Barrel Proof**\n\n*USA - Tennessee Whisky*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 70 ($35 for half bottle - 2023)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 60 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 65.1% ABV\n\n**Details**: Warehouse 3-04, barrel no. 22-04985, bottled May 24, 2022\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 5 months; bottles at 100%, 80% (blind tasting), 70%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Spicy hot bananas, tart cherry, and some sharp, bold oak to start - packed with flavor, and it becomes a bit more sweet. There's mild chocolate, rich brown sugar, and caramel-coated popcorn; hints of leather, vanilla bean, and molasses arrive in time, accented by clove and more spice.\n\n**Palate**: A thick mouthfeel, with warmth, but it doesn't really drink at its 130+ proof. Still some sweetness like brown sugar, molasses, and a bit of plum, but this palate is more dry and woody - wood smoke, burnt caramel, tart cherries, nutmeg, and clove. With time, strong banana notes, like banana bread, come in, and there's a bit of an oatmeal taste.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-long, with plenty of lingering heat and oak notes. Oak spice, charcoal, and slightly bitter coffee; there are subtle flavors of dry vanilla, freeze-dried bananas, clove, and molasses.\n\n**Final Note**: Rich and strong, nice flavor development, not the most complex. This is a very enjoyable cask strength whisky, and it just barely lacks that depth and complexity to elevate it to the next level. It's a single barrel, of course, so results will definitely vary from bottle to bottle; either way, value is very good.

Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Mellow, with plenty of cask influence: decent sherry notes like dark fruit, red fruit candies, red berries, and a mild chocolate note. Oak comes in with baking spices: cardamom and vanilla, and then more fruits arrive - apricot, plums, raisins, and juicy prunes. Underneath the fruits, there's a slight sulfury, musty, meaty flavor, but it's mild.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A medium-thin mouthfeel, and the palate is slightly more dry than the nose. Slightly spirity notes, umami and sharp, before we get into those sherry notes again: orange, soft leather, cardamom, and cola; with time, sweeter flavors of milk chocolate and syrupy raisins come in. Baking spices like vanilla and nutmeg are accent flavors, and the late palate gives us a chalky cocoa powder note.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, with sharp warmth from the spirit and a variety of flavors. There's a drying character and some acidity from the oak, some nutty and spicy flavors, a little bit of fruit like fig or pomegranate seeds, and some maltiness. In the aftertaste, we get cola and a general savory taste.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: To us, there isn't a huge difference when compared against the more famous and loved Sherry Oak 12 year old Macallan.

There are soft herbal spice notes, mint and peppermint, and some sweeter flavors of caramel and buttered rum. Later on, that peppermint turns into candy canes.\n\n**Palate**: Medium mouthfeel, and along with the sweet candy notes, there's some peppery spice up front - black pepper and white pepper. A bit of oak and wood char come in, and caramel and clove add a baking element; with time, more menthol and sweet herbal notes arrive, before glazed strawberry at the end.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length with lots of brown sugar and pepper spice. The rye influence is kept in check, with decent sweetness coming from vanilla and peppermint candies; it has a bit of wood spice, too.\n\n**Final Note**: This is an excellent value bottle - one of the best values that we've rated so far.

Fruity, like sparkling rose and grapefruit, and there's a peppery side as well, with some spirity youth lingering. There's a medium level of peat.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Warm, juicy, fruity, and syrupy - the mouthfeel is medium-thick, and full of fruits. We found orange, cranberry, raspberry, strawberry, cherry, and figs across our tastings; there are both sweet and sour components, and later, just a hint of a meaty note like the nose. With more time, there's some earthy flavors, hot peppers, and some definite youthful spirit notes.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, and still lots of fruits, but more on the dried fruit side at first - dehydrated orange, tart cranberry, unripe or dried strawberries. The peat is mild and presents mostly as an earthy influence, and there are lighter flavors of lemon, vanilla, and white pepper lingering.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Very good whisky - this is already very enjoyable at 3 or so years old, and we can't wait to try something from this distillery at 12 to 15 years old in the future, though that's still a while off.

The distillery is located on Raasay, and island nestled between Skye and the western coast of the Scottish highlands; the location boasts some amazing scenery, one of the reasons this distillery is receiving an increasing number of visitors.\r  \n\r  \nAlasdair Day coordinates distilling operations, and his team has set out to produce a lightly peated, rugged island whisky with balance and flavors of dark fruits. So far, this has been accomplished by blending together peated and unpeated distillate, as well as a wide variety of cask types, such as rye, many types of wine casks, virgin oak, and more. Some bottlings, though, like this Na Sia series, allow single casks in one flavor profile to showcase individual styles.\r  \n\r  \nThis bottling we're diving into is made from peated distillate, and it was aged in an ex-rye whisky cask (one of the cask types used in their flagship single malt). There's no age statement on the bottle, but this is probably 3 to 4 year old whisky; we get a powerful cask strength of 62.4% ABV, and this is a craft-presented whisky, so there's no added coloring and no chill filtration.\r  \n\r  \n**Isle of Raasay Na Sia Single Cask - Peated Ex-Rye Cask**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 114 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 62.4% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-rye cask\r  \n**Details**: Cask 18/627; not chill filtered, no color added; 2018 vintage\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 5 months; bottles at 90%, 80%, and 70% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Raw, powerful, and a little bit spirity - you can feel the youth of the whisky, though it isn't unpleasant. There are buttery oak notes, some shortbread and sweet key lime; sharpness then comes from lemon, pepper, and fizzy soda. The peat has a medium strength, and with time, more funky notes come in: damp hay, salt, and pungent herbal scents.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A thick mouthfeel - an assault on the senses. This is very punchy, with strong peat, strong herbal notes, a syrupy texture, and some sharp, peppery spice. There's some lemon, but we quickly get lots of baking notes: buttered toast, custard, anise, and oats. The herbal side is complex: eucalyptus, lavender, and grass all show up.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Very long finish with lots of peat, herbs, and wood notes - rosemary, lavender, and clove are all plentiful, and there's dry wood, semi-sweet lemon, and some vanilla. Generally quite dry at this point.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Honestly, this could be a decent alternative to a '.1' Octomore, in our opinion, for half the price or less - it doesn't quite deliver the same complexity, but those raw, powerful, peaty, spirity notes keep the nose and mouth engrossed for a while.

It was bottled for ImpEx Beverages, the US importer that works with Ardnamurchan distillery.\r  \n\r  \nThere's no obvious age statement on the bottle, like most Ardnamurchan whiskies, but they do give us some other great information on the bottle, as well as through the QR code link.

There's a nice buttery texture lingering into the finish, and we get salty dry wood, like driftwood, in the aftertaste.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: For us, this is salt and pepper in a whisky. Very true to Ardnamurchan's west coast identity, and the mineral and oil notes add to that vibe. It can be a little raw and spirity, but there's nice flavor development in both the distillate and the ex-bourbon cask, which adds those vanilla and custard notes.

Review #187 - Nulu Toasted Small Batch Bourbon,27,18lck6i,https://i.redd.it/p6wg8ouew27c1.jpeg,1702916284,,"[{'body': ""**Review #187 - Nulu Toasted Small Batch Bourbon**\n\nBottled by Prohibition Craft Spirits, this Nulu bourbon is actually MGP distillate from Indiana. It's a small batch bourbon, and this batch is specific to the Indiana market (batch IN1). While the minimum age of the whisky in the batch is 4 years, details on the back label describe that it's a blend of 4 to 6 year old bourbon barrels.\n\nThis bourbon is finished in toasted barrels, but one point of interest here is the length of the finish - it's a surprisingly short 1 to 4 weeks. How much of an influence will the toasted barrels have with such a short time spent in them?\n\n**Nulu Toasted Small Batch Bourbon**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 75 (2023)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 75 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: 4 Years\n\n**Strength**: 57.7% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: Toasted barrel finish\n\n**Details**: Batch IN1\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 3 months; bottles at 100%, 80% (blind tasting), and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Strong and oaky - toasty, sweet spices of cardamom and brown sugar, sharper spices of nutmeg and cinnamon, and some coconut. There's a nutty side, adding walnuts or pecan turtles; later on, pepper and nutmeg grow stronger and spicier.\n\n**Palate**: Medium-thick mouthfeel, and it's a bit hot and sharp. Oak flavors are again dominant - brown sugar, sawdust, pepper, and cardamom. There's a nice subtle banana flavor in the mid-palate, along with some corn, and later, both sweet vanilla and spicy red pepper flakes.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-long, warm, and still oaky. There's a little bit of creamy vanilla, even a horchata note, and then some dry spice like nutmeg. Later on, an aftertaste of old furniture oak lingers.\n\n**Final Note**: Well, that toasted finish does actually manage to peek through despite the very short maturation time - the nice toasty coconut in the nose, banana in the palate, and creamy horchata in the finish were subtle, but present. Overall, quite a strongly-oaked bourbon for 4 to 6 years old, and it drinks a little hot, but it was pleasant to explore.

This bottle is Hav, an 'oak spice' forward single malt - the aging in ex-bourbon casks and virgin oak reinforces that expectation from the front label.\r  \n\r  \nWe get good presentation from this Swedish malt: there's no added coloring, no chill filtering, and we get a strength of 48% ABV.

There's a good spread of fruit, though: pears, strawberries, golden raisins, and other citrus orchard fruits all appeared at times. Slightly spirity, and there's a hint of musty funk.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Interesting - changed a bit each tasting. Hints of peat, lots of oak spice with a nice mature feeling to it, but also young oak; spices of cinnamon, pepper, vanilla, and then some nougat; fruits of lemon, prunes, orange, apple, and pear. Later on, strong malty chocolate arrives, along with dark syrupy cherries. The mouthfeel has a medium thickness.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, with some oak spice, dry vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon - heavier on the wood notes. The orchard fruits like poached pears and apples (or applesauce) are softer, and there's an interesting mix of fizz, sassafras, and some old school spirit notes that linger.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Nice and interesting, with a unique mix of young and old whisky notes. The virgin oak definitely adds some baking spices and mature character, but there's still some brighter spirit notes hanging around as well. Nice and fruity at times, too, despite the heavy oak flavors - this was a good introduction to Swedish single malts.

Not necessarily - many will point to Springbank 15 as their favorite of the core range, while others find more value and flavor in either the 10 Year or the 18 Year.\r  \n\r  \nIt does stand out as generally the only 100% ex-sherry single malt in Springbank's core range - other ages will sometimes have a majority of sherry, depending on the year of release, but this 15 Year has full-blown sherry maturation. Because of that, and despite the natural color (as usual with Springbank), we get a lovely dark color on the whisky.\r  \n\r  \n**Springbank 15 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Campbeltown - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 160 (2022)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 150 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 15 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: 100% Ex-sherry casks\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 5 times over 8 months; bottles at 90%, 70%, 60% (blind tasting), 50%, and 40% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Dark and rich, dirty and a bit musty - cherry cola, root beer, Mexican spiced chocolate, and ginger all come bursting from the glass. The mustiness comes from some damp oak, even slightly mossy, and there's sweetness from brown sugar and chocolate ice cream. Still slightly spirity with hints of peat, which is nice; nice mature flavors of tobacco leaves and cooked plums come later.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium; the palate reflects the nose quite well. Rich sherry notes of dark chocolate, cherry soda, earthy wood smoke, and orange; woody and funky notes like 'dunnage' funk, ginger, roots, and dirt are plentiful. The soft peat mingles with soft cigar smoke, and later, there are some menthol, almost fermented flavors. With more time, spices like chili powder and cayenne waft in.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, and that characterful sherry is still dominant; not as much of a spirit note is lingering at this point. Fizzy root beer, spearmint, cinnamon and clove... it's slightly grungy, slightly musty, and we have aftertastes of pickled ginger, pomegranate, and soft peat.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Very musty and deep - this definitely needed some time to open up in the glass. It's definitely a good whisky, but this one is a bit more of a cask story compared to some of Springbank's other more balanced malts, in which you can get a bit more distillate character coming through. The sherry casks (or sherry-seasoned casks) in use are clearly high quality, and there's a decent earthy note that comes with them; if you like some funky, dirty, sherried single malt, this will be right up your alley.\r  \n\r  \nIf you can find the stuff, it isn't likely to be the cheapest - value is hurt due to markups and cumbersome distribution processes, at least in our area.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.4 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #183 - Still Austin Cask Strength Bourbon,47,18fx9ku,https://i.redd.it/j6puu6qiqo5c1.jpg,1702308979,,"[{'body': ""**Review #183 - Still Austin Cask Strength Bourbon**\n\nWith a mashbill of 70% corn, 25% rye, and 5% malted barley, this Texas bourbon uses grain entirely grown in the state. In fact, all of Still Austin's whiskies use Texas-grown grains, a part of the distillery's core values, which emphasizes craft production and high quality.\n\nThis cask strength bottling comes in at an even 59% ABV (118 proof), and while there's no obvious age statement on the front label, we do get a statement of two years on the back - not too surprising, considering the hot climate in Texas that the whisky ages in.\n\n**Still Austin Cask Strength Bourbon**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 50 (2023)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 60 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: 2 Years\n\n**Strength**: 59% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 1 month; bottles at 100%, 90%, and 80% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Rich and sweet, lots of candied dark flavors - molasses, dark chocolate, strong vanilla, and dark cherries. The chocolate becomes lighter and more malty with time, and spices come in later: cinnamon, paprika, nutty spice, and cardamom; we end with some butterscotch candies.\n\n**Palate**: Medium-thick mouthfeel, warm but not too hot. Nice oaky spice greets us, with some char, anise, and nutmeg; sweetness comes from brown sugar, molasses, rich chocolate cake, and vanilla cake. Further into the palate, it gets more spicy, with cardamom, clove, smoked paprika, and red pepper flakes.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-long and pleasantly warming; balanced between dessert-sweet and spicy. Enough oak that it almost seems double-oaked, and some barrel char as well, but nice milk chocolate and butterscotch flavors to balance it out; there's an aftertaste of burnt sugar.\n\n**Final Note**: Is this really only two years old? Or is there some older whisky in the blend hiding behind that age statement? This is very nicely developed - strongly flavored, well-balanced, with great sweet flavors and nice strength. The palate is very good, but the nose especially stands out as excellent - those dessert flavors go on and on. Value is pretty good, too - we can find it for $50 to $60 in our area, and it's a definite recommendation at that cost.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 7.3 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Details are plentiful about the production of the spirit: it's Concerto barley, grown on the Scottish mainland, and it was peated to 128.9 ppm during the malting and drying process. We get a vintage of 2017, as well.\r  \n\r  \nBruichladdich always uses craft presentation for their whiskies, so we don't have to worry about chill filtration or added coloring, and we get it at a preferable strength - a cask strength of 59.6% ABV, in this case.\r  \n\r  \n**Bruichladdich Octomore 14.1**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 225 (2023)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 225 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 5 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 59.6% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: First fill ex-bourbon barrels\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added; 2017 vintage; Concerto barley from the Scottish mainland, peated to 128.9 ppm\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 1 month; bottles at 90%, 80%, and 70% fill levels at times of review.

The lemon grows sweeter with time, moving toward lemon-lime soda or even lemon preserve; there's mild oak influence, adding dry wood and some moss. With time, the nose grows much more creamy and slightly lactic, with hints of custard; the peat smoke is medium strength.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A thick mouthfeel, paired with strong (but not overwhelming) peat smokiness. The lemon and custard theme continues from the nose: vanilla, semi-sweet fruit, creamy texture, sugary oil, and estery tropical melon later on. The oak adds some white pepper; all sorts of lemon flavors now, including lemon candies and lemon curd. Very nice texture and mouthfeel.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Lemonade, sweet creamy yogurt, and a decent amount of both black and white pepper. That creamy texture, like custard and lemon curd, lingers for a while, and some strong smoke makes this a medium-long finish.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: It's in line with what we expect from the '.1' Octomore releases - ex-bourbon forward, with plenty of youthful spirit considering the 5 year age statement. This year, it's a little more simple in terms of flavors, but the fantastic mouthfeel and creamy texture make up for that in some ways.

Review #181 - Compass Box Orchard House,40,18cyuqs,https://i.redd.it/8t0s5wk4cw4c1.jpg,1701965125,,"[{'body': 'At 50$ I enjoyed this bottle quite a bit.', 'score': 8}, {'body': ""**Review #181 - Compass Box Orchard House**\n\nAnother well-regarded blended malt from Compass Box - Orchard House is a reasonably priced, ex-bourbon-cask-forward blend without much in the way of peat. There's no mention of the utilized distilleries on the label, but some research online points the way of Balmenach, Benrinnes, Caol Ila, Clynelish, Glen Moray, Linkwood, and Tomatin.\n\nIn addition to those predominant ex-bourbon casks, we do also have some proportion of sherry and French oak in this blend, as well. Still, we'll be on the lookout for orchard fruits, as the name of the whisky suggests, as well as some baking spices.\n\nNo chill filtration or added caramel coloring, as is always the case with Compass Box, and we get this at a pleasant strength of 46% ABV - the new minimum standard for quality single malts.\n\n**Compass Box Orchard House**\n\n*Scotland - Blend*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 47 (2023)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 47 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 46% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon, ex-Oloroso sherry, and French oak\n\n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added, batch L 17 09 22\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 1 month; bottles at 100%, 70%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Softly spirit-forward, and generally bright and fresh. It does have the lighter orchard fruits: lemon, apple, along with the occasional hint of dried mango. There are baking spices like brown sugar and honey, some vanilla and white pepper. With more time, soft oak and some fatty nuts arrive.\n\n**Palate**: Medium thickness mouthfeel, and a bit stronger on the baking side of things now. Sweetness comes from cinnamon, honey, vanilla, and creme brulee or custard, while spice is added by dry oak, white pepper, and sharper cinnamon. There are still subtle fruits of green apples and lemon drop candies; some malty flavors show up, and there's a slight fizz with the spirity side of this.\n\n**Finish**: Soft vanilla, simple syrup, and now the malty tones have turned quite sweet. There's still some mild dry oak, but sweeter fruits come back: pear, lemon, and unripe bananas. There's a bit of weight to the spirit which lingers in this finish; it's a medium length finish overall.\n\n**Final Note**: A classic, tasty blended malt that has a lot of the core flavors we enjoy in an understated, ex-bourbon whisky. It's not the most complex, but it has great balance between spirit and cask; it's slightly sweet, but not overdone in that respect, either. The 46% bottling strength is enough for this as an easy sipper, but the spirit does also have a nice weight to it, with the occasional waxy note drifting through to accent it.\n\nValue here is pretty good - this is a quality malt at a reasonable price.

It's a corn whisky, meaning corn must make up at least 80% of the mashbill, too. Will that difference in corn variety make a major difference in flavor? This is a pot-distilled whisky, so hopefully more of that character is retained, and it comes through after the aging.\n\nThis whisky comes with a bold 1 year age statement, but we get it at a pleasant 46% ABV (92 proof), so it should at least present the flavor well enough.

There's still that funky, savory, earthy character - something like roots and wet wood. Just hints of spiced banana, but not much other fruit - this is all baking spices now: cinnamon, dry vanilla pods, clove, and hints of pepper. Later on, some canned corn flavors arrive.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length, with lots of woody notes: vanilla, pepper, and some wood spice. There's sweetness from candy corn, and then some more harsh varnish and sour notes on the back end.\n\n**Final Note**: This was actually quite challenging to rate. It certainly is interesting - it gets points for that. The funky grain character is very unusual, to the point where we really had no idea what we were tasting when it was blind.

The selling point for the 1910 Old Fine Whisky is the double-oaking process - after spending time aging in new charred oak barrels, the whisky is then re-casked into another new charred oak barrel, imparting a much stronger wood flavor in the spirit.\n\nThis was done out of necessity during the aforementioned fire, when bourbon had already been dumped for bottling, but needed to be stored while the fire was put out and repairs were made to Old Forester's facilities. Interestingly, before entering the second barrel, this bourbon is proofed down to 50% ABV (100 proof) - the distillery expects this to pull out more subtle, sweet flavors.\n\nLike most of Old Forester's whiskies, there's no age statement to be seen, but we do get this at a strength of 46.5% ABV (93 proof), which at least elevates it above some of the typical 40% to 45% ABV entry-level bourbons. Price isn't quite entry level at $50 to $60 around us, but that's the ballpark for a lot of double-oaked bourbons now.\n\n**Old Forester 1910**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 55 (2022)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 52 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 46.5% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 5 times over 9 months; bottles at 100%, 80% (blind tasting), 70% (blind tasting), 60% (blind tasting), and 50% fill levels at times of review.

Banana bread, salted caramel, fruitcake, and Luxardo cherries; maple syrup on pancakes, clove, and coffee cake. There's a decent amount of oak, and later, the dark cherries turn slightly medicinal.\n\n**Palate**: Lots of dark, sweet flavors again - molasses and slightly spicy oak to start. The mouthfeel has a medium thickness at most, but there are some syrupy brown sugar notes to compensate, and some hints of ripe fruit. A little more spicy than the nose, too: clove, tannins, and a sharp burnt sugar all come to mind.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length, oaky, and lots of dark spice notes. Hints of spicy rye grain, caramel, rum cake, and cinnamon are strong; subtle notes of white pepper and nutmeg linger in the aftertaste.\n\n**Final Note**: Fantastic nose, but the palate can't quite live up to it - this needs just a bit more in the way of bottling strength. Still, this was nice to sip on, and it changed a bit in every tasting, offering different sweet flavors. It also gradually improved with time in an open bottle - the final rating was our highest.

Review #178 - Kilkerran 8 Year Cask Strength - Oloroso Sherry Cask Matured,34,18amx09,https://i.redd.it/ijh2c5fqta4c1.jpg,1701704698,,"[{'body': ""**Review #178 - Kilkerran 8 Year Cask Strength - Oloroso Sherry Cask Matured**\n\nBatch 5 of Kilkerran's 8 Year Cask Strength bottling features fresh ex-Oloroso sherry casks, a full term maturation. The cask type used in each release is unique, though there have been enough batches for repeat types at this point; we've seen ex-bourbon, first fill ex-sherry, recharred sherry, and port in the past.\n\nTracking these bottles down can be pretty tricky, depending on where you are - it's quite uncommon in our area, and when we do find it, the price is generally quite steep. The distillery sells this single malt for roughly $75 (using current exchange rates) in their shop, but until very recently, the cheapest we had ever seen was closer to $150.\n\nBecause this distillery is run by the same people as Springbank, we're getting all of the great presentational characteristics we look for - no chill filtering or added color. Because this is a cask strength bottling, a solid strength, too - 56.9% ABV, in this case.\n\n**Kilkerran 8 Year Cask Strength - Oloroso Sherry Cask Matured**\n\n*Scotland/Campbeltown - Single Malt*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 149 (2022)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 125 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: 8 Years\n\n**Strength**: 56.9% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: First fill Oloroso sherry casks\n\n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added; batch #5, bottled January 2021\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 3 months; bottles at 100%, 70%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Fresh, strong, deep, and musty - a juxtaposition between flavors. There's a crisp spirit, along with brighter fruits of raspberry and strawberry, but also plenty of umami notes: sauteed mushrooms, ground beef, dirty sherry casks, machine oil, a hint of root beer. The sherry influence is quite strong, adding more flavors of cranberry and earthiness, and later, there are hints of minerality.\n\n**Palate**: Medium-thick mouthfeel - oiliness from the strength, but not the age. Mild peat building to a medium level, and lots of baking spices now: clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, and brown sugar. There are still sharper fruits like orange, cranberry, and acai berries, but also earthy minerality and some molasses. Lots of character, like the nose.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-long; split into three categories: fruits, wood, and spirit. The spirity funk is fading, with just slight umami/meaty flavors lingering; the oak notes have increased, with wood spice, a hint of smoke, and mild tannins. Fruit is still the dominant category: orange oil, glazed strawberries, and pomegranate are all plentiful.\n\n**Final Note**: Wow, what a blast of old school sherry flavor. The casks have a very strong influence, but surprisingly, the spirit is still able to come through with the funky, savory notes - the limited age probably helps in that regard. Plenty of nice red fruit flavors to go around, and the hints of peat and minerality add to the complexity. Lovely dram, if slightly expensive in our area due to importation and limited availability.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 8.2 / 10"", 'score': 10}, {'body': 'If you can get your hands on the 15year olds that were done in various casks (bourbon, Fino, Oloroso, Port) for their anniversary in 2019/2020 they are really good.

Review #177 - Daftmill 2009 11 Year Summer Batch Release,16,188fi3q,https://i.redd.it/cn50shxsip3c1.jpg,1701446775,,"[{'body': ""**Review #177 - Daftmill 2009 11 Year Summer Batch Release**\n\nDaftmill, one of the smallest, yet most sought-after, distilleries in Scotland - it's a Lowland whisky, located near Fife. They began operations on their whisky business in 2005, though the family had owned the farm for some time before that - since 1984, in fact.\n\nIn an uncommon move for modern new distilleries, they did not sell any product in the first few years to ensure some cash flow; instead, they waited until they were comfortable that the whisky was truly 'ready,' releasing their first batch in 2018 with a 12 year age statement.\n\nLike many new-age distilleries, though, we get tons of information about the production of this whisky - Daftmill has been very transparent. The barley used is of the Optic variety (all grown on the distillery's estate), and it was harvested in August 2006, before malting during the summer of 2007; interestingly, it then sat for almost 2 years before distillation occurred in June and July of 2009.\n\nThese Daftmill whiskies are generally produced in very small batches - this specific batch, made for the United States, consisted of just 5 casks: four ex-bourbon barrels, as well as one first-fill sherry butt. There's no added color or chill filtration, as is customary with Daftmill - they're focused on presenting the highest quality whisky possible.\n\n**Daftmill 2009 11 Year Summer Batch Release**\n\n*Scotland/Lowlands - Single Malt*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 235 (2022)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 235 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: 11 Years\n\n**Strength**: 46% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: 4 ex-bourbon barrels, 1 first fill ex-sherry butt\n\n**Details**: 2009 vintage; 1,680 bottles; Optic barley variety\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 5 times over 3 months; bottles at 100%, 90% (blind tasting), 80% (blind tasting), 70%, and 60% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Fruity and malty - there's a decent amount of orange, along with some golden apple and darker dried fruits. Plenty of malt, which transitions toward chocolate and some other baking notes: white pepper, soft honey, butterscotch, and a hint of licorice. Moderate complexity, and later, some sharper spirit scents.\n\n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium, and we find mostly baking spices and orchard fruits. Dry vanilla, cinnamon, brown sugar, and peppercorns... slightly sweet overall, and then some chocolate and demerara sugar. The fruits are poached pear, orange marmalade, and prunes; the texture is creamy, and there's a fizzy element later on, like spearmint, as we transition toward the finish.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length, and it's all malt and baking spice now: pepper, anise, barrel spice, brown sugar syrup, and cinnamon. The malt sometimes turned slightly sour, and there's more oak in this finish; in the aftertaste, tiny hints of lemon and pear.\n\n**Final Note**: Decent whisky - this is a solid malt, if a little unexceptional in any way. Plenty of baking spices and maltiness, and some fruits as well, but none of the flavors were too strong. Rounded and somewhat well balanced, but the trick here is the value.\n\nOf course, because of the demand for these bottles, along with the very limited supply, prices are going to be higher than we would like. They aren't cheap coming from the distillery, but once this gets through the import and distribution process in the US, quite a premium has been added on.

Review #175 - Henry McKenna 10 Year Single Barrel,67,186rv8m,https://i.redd.it/si1dseqv0b3c1.jpg,1701271251,,"[{'body': ""**Review #175 - Henry McKenna 10 Year Single Barrel**\n\nMany bourbons have experienced a huge change in perception in the last 10 years, often changing from shelf regulars to more 'allocated' products with inflated prices and a lack of availability. Few experienced the change quite like Henry McKenna's 10 Year Single Barrel bourbon.\n\nAfter winning 'best in show' in 2019 at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, this $30 bourbon's popularity exploded, and on top of its price rising, it became almost impossible to find in many places. It's starting to become a bit more available again, and prices are more reasonable now, especially if you avoid the secondary market.\n\nHenry McKenna 10 Year Single Barrel is made at the Heaven Hill, where it rests for 'forty seasons' in federally bonded warehouses before being bottled with the 10 year age statement. As it is bottled-in-bond, it comes with a 100 proof, or 50% ABV, strength; each barrel is distillate made in a single distilling season.\n\n**Henry McKenna 10 Year Single Barrel**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 60 (2023)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 60 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\n\n**Strength**: 50% ABV\n\n**Details**: Bottled in bond\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 18 months; bottles at 50% (Barrel 11019), 30% (Barrel 13331), and 100% (unknown barrel) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Rich, rounded, and somewhat subtle - a decent amount of oak, along with baking spices of brown sugar and vanilla bean. There are definitely some older, or more mature, scents here: dusty old wood and some tobacco leaf, along with a peppery spice. Becomes slightly sweeter later, with hints of cherries.\n\n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium or so; both sweet and dry, with a decent oak spice, as well as sugary baking flavors. Nut butter, caramel, unsmoked tobacco, and wood smoke all combine for a relatively complex backbone; softer notes of cherry, cinnamon, and orange are present with more time.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length or a bit more, and sweeter again in the finish: dark fruits of cherry or prune, candied orange slices, and brown sugar are balanced by dry wood, tobacco smoke, and musty unsmoked cigars.\n\n**Final Note**: Like all single barrel bourbons, the product and quality is going to vary at least slightly from bottle to bottle. We've tried to review across a selection of barrels to get a more general idea of the flavor profile and quality, and in our personal experience, we've enjoyed each example of this McKenna 10 Year that we've tasted during the review process. \n\nThe topic of the deserved price of this bottle comes up frequently in the whisky community - what's really fair for this 10 Year, especially taking into consideration the potentially artificial price increases in recent years over the previous $30 asking price? Inflation is a real thing, but we're looking at double that old price in a lot of markets. Is it really worth that? Our opinion - if you see this sub-$60, we would give it a shot, but there's always potential to find a sub-par barrel.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 7.0 / 10"", 'score': 16}, {'body': 'I really wanted to like this bourbon but after 3 btls and none of them better than 5/10, it’s a hard pass now.

Or KC store picks."", 'score': 6}, {'body': ""**Review #174 - Basil Hayden's Kentucky Straight Bourbon**\n\nMade at the Jim Beam distillery, Basil Hayden's Kentucky Straight Bourbon is a high-rye bourbon, made with the intention of being as smooth and welcoming to the category of bourbon as possible. It's bottled at the minimum 40% ABV (80 proof), and the brand says that we can expect flavors like vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, and black pepper.\n\nWhile this bourbon previously carried an eight year age statement, there's no official statement about how long it's 'artfully aged' at this point; because of the 'straight' designation on the label, and the lack of an age statement, we can surmise that it spends at least four years in the barrel.\n\n**Basil Hayden's Kentucky Straight Bourbon**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 30 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 40% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 18 months; bottles at 70%, 40%, and 20% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Balanced between sweet and dry, and the overall feeling is a bit light and thin. The sweeter scents are vanilla, caramel corn, and a hint of cherry; the spice comes in the forms of clove, black and white pepper, semi-dry oak, and a hint of anise.\n\n**Palate**: A little more dry on the palate; the mouthfeel is thin, a bit watery. Light salted caramel and some vanilla add accents of sweetness, but this is mostly wood spice, black pepper, blanched almond, and a bit of chemical acetone. Later, tart cherry and clove arrive.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-short in length, and still mostly woody notes - dry, slightly salty, not too warm. Dusty corn and soft caramel linger, and a soft aftertaste of vanilla and salted nuts comes later.\n\n**Final Note**: This really suffers from the baseline 80 proof presentation. We actually like that it isn't too sweet, but there isn't a lot of flavor development in general - just general flavors/sensations like 'dry' and mild baking spice. The thin palate doesn't really help the experience, and around the $30 mark, there is a lot of competition.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 4.3 / 10"", 'score': 11}, {'body': 'What would everyone consider to be a fair price for Basil Hayden?', 'score': 2}, {'body': ""I tried this for the first time - I enjoyed it for what it was and I'd buy a bottle for cocktails.

Review #173 - 1792 Small Batch,14,182vb5k,https://i.redd.it/t8zf8k9jjb2c1.jpg,1700841690,,"[{'body': '**Review #173 - 1792 Small Batch**\n\nDistilled at the Barton distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky, the 1792 brand is named for the year that Kentucky joined as a state in the USA. The distillery has been operating since 1879, and a number of brands of whisky are produced there, including 1792, Very Old Barton, Kentucky Tavern, and many more.\n\nThis Small Batch bourbon comes in at 93.7 proof, a nice bump up from many of the entry level bourbons we see at 86 or 90 proof; it uses rye as the secondary grain, so after the sweetness from the corn, we could see a background of spice. There\'s no mention of maturation time, but other sources online point to ""at least four years.""\n\n**1792 Small Batch**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 26 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 46.85% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 18 months; bottles at 50%, 20%, and 10% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Balanced, maybe leaning a little sweet: cinnamon and brown sugar, along with a cherry or dark red fruit note that popped up in all of the tastings. Oak is relatively mild, but there\'s a backbone of dusty corn, candy corn, and a dry, nutty scent.\n\n**Palate**: Medium-thin mouthfeel, maybe pushing up toward medium thickness; baking spices are plentiful with clove, brown sugar, mild vanilla, and a burnt caramel. That red fruit hangs around, too: sharp cherry jam, red wine, or some tart blackberry. Not particularly oaky, and the sweetness becomes more syrupy with time.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length, with soft balanced oak, a mild peppery tickle, and some sugary notes of brown sugar and vanilla bean. Not as much fruit now, except a hint of freeze dried strawberry in the aftertaste.\n\n**Final Note**: Not bad, but a little uninspired and basic. For $26, that\'s fair enough - probably in line with expectations.

Review #172 - Springbank 10 Year,55,181b8yc,https://i.redd.it/9m8majub0x1c1.jpg,1700665740,,"[{'body': ""**Review #172 - Springbank 10 Year**\n\nThe base core range release from Springbank distillery - this is Springbank 10 Year, the youngest and most common of their age-stated bottles. It has the typical Springbank treatment, with quality specifications and no meddling with coloring or extra filtering.\n\nThe 10 Year generally leans toward the ex-bourbon side of maturation, though there's usually some amount of ex-sherry maturation as well; often, we see it in ratios like 60% bourbon/40% sherry, or 70% bourbon/30% sherry. Considering our love of ex-bourbon Springbank, this is giving us high hopes going into the tastings.\n\n**Springbank 10 Year**\n\n*Scotland/Campbeltown - Single Malt*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 83 (2022)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 83 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\n\n**Strength**: 46% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks\n\n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 9 months; bottles at 100%, 70%, 60%, and 50% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Charred orange rind and some sharper, spirity notes - this is rich, and has quite a bit of depth for a 10 year whisky. Lots of different facets: sweetness from brown sugar, vanilla, and tropical fruits of melon and guava; spice from oak, cinnamon, and subtle smokiness; funky notes of industrial oil or a dank cellar. With time, you can tease out delicate scents of flowers and honeyed apples, maybe a hint of salinity.\n\n**Palate**: Medium-thick mouthfeel, and like the nose, a diverse range of flavors. There's some spicy or peppery oak, some clove, along with some smoother buttery oak; fusel and oily notes from the spirit; tons of fruits, like apricot, creamy melon, lime sherbet, and apples; soft floral notes of perfume and wax, even honeycomb. Hidden behind the bright notes are some darker, deeper flavors from the sherry: oily sausage, dry red wine, just slightly savory.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length, nicely rich and with a lingering weighty mouthfeel. Oak is pretty mild, but there are nice baking notes of honey, vanilla, caramel, and cinnamon spice; slightly funky notes of damp hay come, and then we end with a soft fruity flavor.\n\n**Final Note**: It's just so solid. Really nice - not the punchiest due to the relatively standard ABV, but the flavor development is far ahead of most 10 year whiskies, and it incorporates flavors from many categories, like fruits, spice, spirit, and baking notes. It definitely does lean toward the ex-bourbon side of things - there are just subtle hints of the smaller proportion of sherry casks.\n\nWhile this still isn't easy to find, the dynamics between supply and demand seem to be improving slightly, and we're seeing the bottle on shelves near us a little more often; auction prices are softening, too, so hopefully it's only going to improve from here. If you can buy this Springbank 10 around the RRP in your respective market, there's a decent chance you're getting good value for the level of flavor.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 7.5 / 10"", 'score': 10}, {'body': ""Springbank 10 is my favorite!

Review #171 - Springbank 18 Year,67,180jlrg,https://i.redd.it/lnh76or5zp1c1.jpg,1700580592,,"[{'body': ""**Review #171 - Springbank 18 Year**\n\nSpringbank 18 - the first of the 'older' Springbank single malts, you could say, and the cutoff before the price goes absolutely crazy, at least in our area. This isn't cheap, either, but due to the limited production of the 21 Year, 25 Year, and 30 Year bottles, their costs are exorbitant.\n\nWe were lucky enough to find a bottle, specifically the 2022 release (bottled in August), and after hearing so much about the distillery and this age statement, we were eager to dig into this malt. This year, the cask makeup was a majority of ex-bourbon barrels, 65% to be precise, while ex-sherry casks made up the other 35% of the maturation.\n\nAs usual with Springbank, we get all of the good presentation marks: no chill filtering, no added coloring, and a strength of 46% ABV.\n\n**Springbank 18 Year**\n\n*Scotland/Campbeltown - Single Malt*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 230 (2023)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 250 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: 18 Years\n\n**Strength**: 46% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: 65% ex-bourbon, 35% ex-sherry cask (2022 release)\n\n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 3 months; bottles at 90%, 80%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Deep, a bit dirty or earthy, with some root beer and a bit of spirit influence still lingering; some chocolatey notes like cocoa and chalky dark chocolate, and then hints of cigar smoke. This take a long time to open up - later, the nose moved toward bookcases or old books, old polished wood, and some soft peat smoke. Hints of savory scents like charred barbecue and meaty mushrooms, and then some brown spices; soft notes of brine and oil.\n\n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium-thick, and the main theme is those dark, sweet, subtle flavors again: root beer and sassafras, dessert wine, milk chocolate, cocoa powder, and a strong cola note. There is a slightly fizzy, spirity side, but that's relatively reserved; the classic 'Campbeltown funk' is definitely in play, with flavors of earth and light funkiness. With time, sweeter brown sugar and orange make their ways out; it gets more syrupy; old, polished wood grows stronger.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-long, with the softest layer of sweet peat smoke lingering. There's still a nice character and weight to the spirit: earthy, coating, and soft warmth. Sassafras and cigar smoke linger for a while, along with old wood and a hint of chocolate.\n\n**Final Note**: This is a very good whisky. It didn't quite wow us like we expected, but that's probably on us - because of the reputation that Springbank enjoys these days, we had extremely high expectations for this bottle. It was more subtle than we expected, more restrained, but still full of quality and nice, dark, old flavors.\n\nAs always, the trick is finding the bottle - even when you can, it often is quite expensive, depending on where you buy it, and how many middlemen it has gone through to get there. Because of that, value suffers a bit; still, it's a unique experience, and in the realm of premium-priced whiskies, this is a good malt.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 7.9 / 10"", 'score': 13}, {'body': 'How do you compare this to the Springbank 15?\n\nSeems like for a lot of core ranges the 18yrs are reviewed lower or equal to 15-16yrs.', 'score': 3}, {'body': 'I usually have this one at home.

There has been another bottling now, for the 15th anniversary - it's very possible that we'll see a 20th anniversary bottle in a few years.\n\nThis is actually a blended malt, not a blend - all of the whiskies used to make it are malts from Scottish distilleries. In an unusual move for blended whisky, we actually know the makeup of this bottle: the distillate came from Ardbeg, Clynelish, Dailuaine, and Teaninich. Quite a mix of quality single malts, and we're expecting some weight in the mouthfeel due to a couple of the inclusions.\n\nThe casks used for aging were relatively simple: an American standard barrel, presumably ex-bourbon, and a virgin French oak barrel. That French oak might add some spice, but we're expecting a nice focus on the base spirits due to the lack of wine casks or other exotic finishing oak.\n\n**Compass Box The Nectar 10th Anniversary**\n\n*Scotland - Blend*\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 460 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 46% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: American standard barrel, new French oak\n\n**Details**: Bottled October 2016; blend of Ardbeg, Clynelish, Teaninich, and Dailuaine; not chill filtered, no color added, 660 bottles\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 3 months; bottles at 80%, 70% (blind tasting), and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Deep and rich, with a medium level of peat - seaside peat, with seaweed and a slight medicinal character - very measured. Wood smoke and salinity accent the peat, before we get into soft red and orange fruits; baking spices come in the form nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla.\n\n**Palate**: A nice, solid character to the spirit - the mouthfeel is medium-thick, and the peat smoke from the nose grows stronger into the palate. Lots of hot peppers and rich, warming oak, but it's all well balanced and almost restrained. Sweet and sour lime fruit, vanilla, and dry hay all appear later.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-long in length, with a decent amount of peat and dry wood, which adds pepper and spicy red pepper flakes. There's sweetness, too: creme brulee, and sweet peppers, but this leans a bit toward the dry side; a hint of youth and more savory notes linger in the aftertaste.\n\n**Final Note**: What a well-balanced, elegant whisky. Peat is definitely a strong theme - Ardbeg must have been used in no small proportion, but it's never overwhelming, and it leaves space for the subtle fruit and plentiful spice flavors to come in. We love the distilleries that were used in this blend, and they've been allowed to showcase their strengths.\n\nBecause this was such a limited bottling (for the Belgian market), and the release was seven years ago, prices are quite hefty - value can't be too good.

Review #169 - Old 55 Single Barrel - Moontown Brewing Pick,16,17xh17h,https://i.redd.it/k8ypm98vax0c1.jpg,1700233437,,"[{'body': ""**Review #169 - Old 55 Single Barrel - Moontown Brewing Pick**\n\nAnother look at a distillery relatively local to us: Old 55. This is a small bourbon distillery in Newtown, Indiana - they've been going for about 10 years now, based near the family's farm.\n\nEssentially all of the whiskies bottled by Old 55 are actually single barrel bourbon - most of them are bottled in bond, as well, aging for 4 years after a Spring or Fall distillation season, before being bottled at 50% ABV (100 proof).\n\nThis barrel was picked for a local brewery, not too far from the distillery - Moontown Brewing Company. Based in Whitestown, Indiana, Moontown shares a very unique character with Old 55 Distillery: both are based in old schoolhouses in their respective hometowns. This was the first barrel pick done by Old 55 for the craft brewery.\n\n**Old 55 Single Barrel - Moontown Brewing Pick**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 80 (2023 - for an equivalent product)\n\n**Age Statement**: 4 Years\n\n**Strength**: 50% ABV\n\n**Details**: Bottled-in-bond, distilled Fall 2018, bottled Fall 2022, picked for Moontown Brewing Co.\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 7 months; bottles at 90%, 80%, and 20% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Strong oak - somewhat dry, nutty, not a ton of sweetness at first. There's dusty corn grain and acetone, along with dry vanilla pods, even some sharper black pepper. Lightly earthy, and with a lot more time, hints of sweetness come through: brown sugar mostly, with a whiff of orange and cherry fruit.\n\n**Palate**: Medium-thick mouthfeel; oak is again dominant - it's strong, with lots of spices. Anise, pepper, dry vanilla and sweet vanilla, cooking spice. So much oak. There's char, soft herbal notes, and a super-dry wood, like sun-bleached driftwood; later, a little bit of barbecue flavor comes in.\n\n**Finish**: Lightly herbal and earthy, oily, and plenty of oak tones again: fresh lumber, nutmeg, cinnamon, and char. There are soft sweet flavors in the aftertaste, like sweet corn, cherry, and a mild caramel.\n\n**Final Note**: A bit one dimensional, and very strongly oaked, especially for spirit that's only four years old. Old 55 does use 30 gallon new charred oak barrels for their aging, as opposed to the typical \\~53 gallon barrels used by most of the American whisky industry; while that practice could possibly 'age' the whisky faster and introduce more mature flavors at a in a shorter time, it does also vastly increase the risk of over-oaking the product. For us, we would like to see a little more time taken to introduce the oak in a measured way, which would also allow for some more flavor development and complexity.

A bit of dry oak and sugary lemon, along with simple syrup and some sweet bell peppers; the flavors aren't particularly strong, and the palate gets more watery with time.\n\n**Finish**: Mild peat, dry white pepper, mild wood tannins, and some barrel char.

This, time, though, instead of another age statement or a strange cask mix, it's the base spirit that's been meddled with - the barley used to create the whisky was kilned with an unusual mixture of fuels. Instead of typical air drying, or the often seen heavy peat smoke, this barley was dried using a mixture of 'woodland botanicals.'\n\nThose botanicals include juniper berries (a key gin ingredient), birch bark, heather flowers, and some peat as well, which could add a layer of smoke. There's no mention of casks on the packaging, but on Glenmorangie's website, the brand describes the scheme as 'ex-bourbon and refill' casks, so that the underlying spirit can be allowed to shine through without too much interference.\n\n**Glenmorangie A Tale of the Forest**\n\n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 100 (2023)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 100 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 46% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon and refill casks\n\n**Details**: Barley kilned with woodland botanicals (juniper berries, birch bark, heather flowers, and peat)\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 2 months; bottles at 100%, 90% (blind tasting), and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Definitely unusual: herbal and floral, with eucalyptus, anise, strong juniper, and some soft woody smoke. Quite a few flavors, actually - this pulls us in a lot of direction. Fruits of raisins and berries, even moldy lemons, but also sweetness from caramel and brown sugar. There's another side, as well, with fish oil and salt, almost a clammy scent.\n\n**Palate**: Medium thickness mouthfeel, quite a lot of wood smoke and actually a decent peat kick. Quite a lot of dark flavors at first: fig and blackberry, dark chocolate, treacle, root beer. There's still a floral side to this as well, with juniper (bordering on gin flavor), purple flowers, peppermint, a slightly effervescence. Decent sweetness, with vanilla and cinnamon orange later.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length - peat and woody notes linger, along with flowers and a fizzy feeling. Soft baking notes of pepper and caramel, before pine wood and cigar smoke arrive. There are still some fruity notes, too: berries, orange, and a bit of rhubarb.\n\n**Final Note**: Well, this certainly was interesting. We liked the overall experience, but the flavors were quite unusual overall, and it reminded us of an aged gin at times. The somewhat soft peat influence was a nice additional to the Glenmorangie spirit, and the subtle casks did a good job of highlighting the distillate. Interesting mix of fruits, herbs and floral notes - this is a good one to dive into if you have some time.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 7.2 / 10"", 'score': 15}, {'body': ""Great review!

Review #165 - Kilchoman Concierge Small Batch No. 2,27,17s6syj,https://i.redd.it/398ndpb9kjzb1.jpg,1699631236,,"[{'body': ""**Review #165 - Kilchoman Concierge Small Batch No. 2**\n\nWe're Kilchoman fans and Sauternes cask maturation fans; after trying most of the distillery's core range, we find ourselves looking for more unique bottlings, whether they come in the form of single casks or limited release small batch products. When we found this bottle combining Kilchoman and Sauternes, we had to snag it.\n\nIn fact, the maturation of this whisky release is only 25% Sauternes, far from a majority. 70% of the maturation was done in bourbon barrels, and the remaining 5% was completed in sherry casks. Like many of the new age distilleries, Kilchoman is more transparent with their information, so they describe the small batch blending process on the back of the bottle:\n\n“This small batch vatting combines ex-bourbon barrel and Oloroso sherry cask matured Kilchoman at 46% ABV with one specially selected Sauternes cask, at natural cask strength. The result is a marriage of classic Kilchoman citrus and peat smoke notes with layers of fresh fruit and textured Sauternes sweetness.”\n\nSounds like they essentially tossed a cask strength ex-Sauternes barrel in with a typical batch of Machir Bay, raising the overall strength and adding that sweet wine influence.\n\nLike all Kilchoman whiskies, this is not chill filtered and natural color, statements that are proudly emblazoned on the front label in reflective golden lettering. There’s no age statement, but considering the age of the distillery and the usual age of their releases, we're assuming it’s relatively young whisky, possibly 5 to 8 years old.\n\nThis small batch bottling is Batch No. 2, created for the Total Wine chain of big box liquor stores in the United States. The outturn consisted of 1,260 bottles, so this is a relatively limited bottling, but they should still be available on the shelf in select locations across the US."", 'score': 4}, {'body': ""Which is everyone's favorite Islay distillery, and why?"", 'score': 2}, {'body': 'Similar cask configuration to my UK batch 3!', 'score': 2}, {'body': '**Kilchoman Concierge Small Batch No. 2**\n\n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 93 (2023)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 93 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 49.7% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: 70% ex-bourbon, 5% ex-Oloroso sherry, 25% ex-Sauternes\n\n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added, batch no. 2; 1,260 bottles\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 4 months; bottles at 100%, 80% (blind tasting), and 60% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Bright and crisp to start – strong peat with an agave or mezcal side to it, almost a little floral. Plenty of sweetness in the forms of green apple and lemon, but also crème brulee and buttery, freshly baked bread. Some sharper white pepper, but also hot peppers, or a spicy fruit and pepper jam. With more time to oxidize, stone fruit like nectarines comes forward.\n\n**Palate**: Plenty of hot peppers and smoke come through from the nose; it’s warm and spirity, potent and a little bit youthful. There’s a medium body to it, providing campfire smoke, ashy peat, quite a bit of sea salt, and sweet lemons. Black pepper gives way to peach and jalapeno jam, and there’s a lighter tone of dried hay on the back of the palate.\n\n**Finish**: The finish brings oats and buttery oil, along with lots of ashy smoke, grainy wheat bread, and pickled jalapenos; hidden among the dying embers, there are limes and some candied lemon rind.\n\n**Final Note**: This whisky brings plenty of the character that Kilchoman is known for – bright fruits like lemon, plenty of ashy peat smoke, and a sea salty complexion. It also does a good job of adding in that sweetness from the wine casks – we can see it in the flavors of crème brulee and peach, among others. Relatively well balanced, at least between spirit character and cask influence.\n\nThis is on the young side – you can taste it. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though. Because the level of smokiness will generally decrease the longer a whisky ages in a cask, younger whiskies can provide a rich, raw experience when they’re peated. This one is visceral; the hot pepper notes and bright, crisp spirit mix with the smokiness to provide plenty kick. It takes water well, too, which mellows the spirit and brings the sweeter notes to the front, along with the lemon.', 'score': 10}, {'body': ""Octomore, because imho, you can't beat the combination of intense peat and natural proof."", 'score': 4}, {'body': 'Hi all, I’m a new scotch drinker (the past 4 months) and so far my favorite Islay is Ardbeg.

I have a summer home about 15 miles from the distillery and stop by at least once or twice a year.\n\nI had a good friend come and visit me last month and we did the tour.  Most of their output is used for Diageo blends which is probably why we don’t see any more of a ‘core range’. \n\nTheir Distiller’s Editon and Distillery Exclusive versions are also very good. I’ve preferred the Distiller’s Edition myself as it has a higher percentage of sherry aged whisky.\n\nI did confirm that the 14 is chill-filtered even though it’s bottled at 46%.  Not sure why they feel the need to do that or how much better it might be if they didn’t, but I still like it so I’m not going to avoid it just because off that.\n\nIt’s readily available and still in the mid $60s around me (NJ).

On top of that, it's becoming increasingly uncommon to find Clynelish bottles from independent bottlers, so those of us who love the distillery really need to search for our fix.\n\nIn an unusual move from Diageo, we do actually get this Clynelish 14 Year at 46% ABV, which is a nice touch.

The chemical/herbal notes from the nose come back stronger - they're starting to take over the experience. Earthy, eucalyptus, nail polish remover, and flowers, young spirit notes; then, we do find some caramel and grain, along with clove and cardamom.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-long, with lingering warmth from the ABV and some peppery charcoal. Slightly mineral and still herbal/flowery, with a hint of that chemical character lingering. There's butterscotch and soft vanilla on the sweeter side, and this mellows out to become mild overall.\n\n**Final Note**: With all of the herbal spice notes, this almost drinks more like a rye than a single malt; there are a few nice sweet flavors with the baking spices and caramel, but much of the experience is dominated by the young, chemical, grainy character, especially in the palate.

Review #163 - Stranahan's Single Barrel Cask Strength,38,17qnrcg,https://i.redd.it/mcai5qcd45zb1.jpg,1699456418,,"[{'body': ""**Review #163 - Stranahan's Single Barrel Cask Strength**\n\nIn this new wave of American single malts, there are a few distilleries that have established themselves as the leaders in quality and age, helping to push the category forward. In our opinion, this is one of them: Stranahan's, out of Denver, Colorado, founded in 2004.  Unlike most other American whisky distilleries, Stranahan's is focusing solely on single malts.\n\nOne of their less common bottlings is the single barrel product, presented at cask strength - according to the distillery's website, they've been released in quite limited numbers. Our bottle is from a cask that was picked by the local Total Wine branch, and was aged seven years and one month before being bottled at a cask strength of 57.77% ABV, or 115.54 proof.\n\n**Stranahan's Single Barrel Cask Strength**\n\n*USA - Single Malt*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 52 (2023)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 54 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: 7 Years\n\n**Strength**: 57.77% ABV\n\n**Details**: 2016 vintage, barrel 16-1960\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 6 months; bottles at 100%, 70%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Quite sweet - a range of desserts. Strawberries, cherries, cherry Coca-Cola, chalky chocolate, lots of chocolate and malt, and then some syrupy caramel. A decent amount of oak as well - both dry and sweet, and it gives lots of baking spices: cinnamon, clove, and dry vanilla, as well as some sawdust. Interestingly, later on, we got a bit of tart lemonade, but the star of this nose is really the grainy, malty chocolate.\n\n**Palate**: A decent spirity kick - it's warm, and has a medium-thick mouthfeel. Again, there's a lot of sweet, malty chocolate notes, along with sweet oak and some underripe strawberries; then, more spice comes to the front, with black pepper, vanilla pods, and cinnamon. With more time to open, the sweetness really expands: warm caramel, brown sugar, oranges, decadent smooth chocolates, and cola. Quite complex and layered, and generally leaning sweet.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-long finish, and it's all sweet now. Brown sugar, cinnamon, white chocolate and milk chocolate; there's orange fruit, malt, and caramel as well. The oak is still somewhat strong, and comes in the form of sawdust, and we end with a soft tannin and some sugar cookies.\n\n**Final Note**: What did they age this in, ex-chocolate milkshake barrels? This must be the maltiest, most chocolatey whisky we can remember trying. It is good, but it also needs a lot of time to open up and reveal its complexities; our first rating didn't yield as high of a score, but this is getting better all the time.\n\nThe strong malty and chocolatey notes are a theme we're finding with American single malts aged in new charred oak barrels - could be a good bottle to look out for if you like sweet whiskies, although all single barrel products will have some natural flavor variation. Good value, too, with a price just over $50 for a 7+ year old cask strength whisky.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 7.1 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #162 - Found North Batch 006-S Second Summit,41,17pw8ly,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17pw8ly,1699369400,,"[{'body': ""**Review #162 - Found North Batch 006-S Second Summit**\n\n*Thanks to* u/whiskytrails *for sharing this sample with us!*\n\nBased out of Massachusetts, Found North is a relatively new bottler specializing in well-aged Canadian whiskies. Batch 006 was a 17 year old blend of Canadian whiskies with a mashbill of 87% corn, 12% rye, and 1% malted barley; for this Second Summit batch, they reserved 500 liters of the aged spirit for an additional 8 months of maturation, pushing it over the 18 year age mark in the end. That finishing was done in an ex-Pedro Ximenez sherry butt, which could add some fruity flavors from the sweet, syrupy dessert wine.\n\nWhile the age statement of 18 years is taken from the youngest whisky in the batch, there is actually whisky as old as 26 years in this blend. Before the PX finish, this spent time aging in new Hungarian oak, new American oak, and ex-bourbon barrels.\n\n**Found North Batch 006-S Second Summit**\n\n*USA/Canada - Blend*\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 160 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: 18 Years\n\n**Strength**: 64.9% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: Hungarian oak, American oak, ex-bourbon barrels, PX sherry cask finish\n\n**Details**: Batch 006-S, 642 bottles; not chill filtered; mashbill of 87% corn, 12% rye, and 1% malted barley\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 1 month; bottle at 90% fill level at time of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Almost exotic at the start with orange and red fruit, along with a hint of sulfury sherry influence, but soon, the deep, dark, rich flavors open up. Brown sugar and dark roast coffee, tons of fermented tobacco leaves, strong sweet oak, and maple syrup; worn leather arrives later, and there's some dusty furniture oak. Subtle to start, but ends up very rich.\n\n**Palate**: Wow. A thick, syrupy mouthfeel, with the perfect mix of sweet and bitter flavors. Tons of tobacco smoke and sweet, old oak; delicate orange rind, or orange oil; caramel, brown sugar, and molasses; spices of anise and nutmeg, and a hint of pepper. The oak becomes perfumed with time, and then vanilla and dark chocolate arrive.\n\n**Finish**: Syrupy sweetness like maple syrup and dark chocolate-covered acai berries, along with plenty of dry oak and barrel char. There's a mild wood smoke still lingering, but also the smoke of cigars and bitter tobacco leaves. Soft tannins and leather add more dry tones, and we found a bit of savory grain on the back end in one tasting; soft notes of hay and vanilla linger in the aftertaste.\n\n**Final Note**: Outstanding. This is one of the most richly flavored, mature, stunning whiskies we've ever tasted; the arrival on the palate is especially fantastic, and despite the monstrous 129.8 proof, the heat isn't overpowering at all. Loads of old oak and tobacco notes, and the sweetness layered in reminds us of a variety of desserts. Can't recommend this one enough - this is an amazing whisky.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 9.3 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

In fact, there is a series of 10 year Octomore bottlings, and today, we're looking at the 4th edition of this series, which came in 2020.\r  \n\r  \nAs per usual, Bruichladdich gives us lots of information about the whisky. The barley used was peated to 208 ppm in the malting process; this has a vintage of 2009; there were 12,000 bottles of this release produced, meaning it's somewhat limited, but not the most rare whisky. Along with that transparency, we get the usual lack of coloring and chill filtration that comes with every Bruichladdich whisky, and a solid cask strength of 54.3% ABV.\r  \n\r  \n**Bruichladdich Octomore 10 Year 4th Edition**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 260 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 54.3% ABV\r  \n**Details**: 208 ppm peat level; 2009 vintage, 12,000 bottles, 4th release, bottled in 2020; not chill filtered, no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 1 month. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: The peat is decently strong, but far from overwhelming - instead, sweeter notes of lime, vanilla, and custard are plentiful. These are balanced by sharpness from both spirit notes and some tart lemon; with time, that lemon scent sweetens, becoming almost a moldy lemon. That combines with the mineral, earthy, and lactic flavors from the spirit to create a funky experience; there is also plenty of damp hay, brine, and some petrichor.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium-thick mouthfeel, quite velvety, with more dry notes compared to the nose: dry oak, peppercorns, white pepper, and charred wood like a day-old campfire. There are still sweet notes of butterscotch, custard, lemon candies, and charred oranges; with time, tropical honeydew fruit and freshly baked bread crust arrive.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Long, with dry wood and grassy hay to start. Like the palate, vanilla custard adds sweetness, along with citrusy lime sherbet; it's spirity, and the aftertaste of peat smoke is the star, lasting several minutes.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Great whisky - it isn't the most complex, but there's this underlying character in the spirit that's just very solid and weighty. The mouthfeel is great, adding to those velvety custard notes, and while the peat is strong, it gives plenty of room for some classic ex-bourbon flavors of light fruit and baking spice to come to the front.

Review #160 - Russell's Reserve 13 Year,85,17mxky3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17mxky3,1699025173,,"[{'body': ""**Review #160 - Russell's Reserve 13 Year**\n\n*Another huge thank you to* u/whiskytrails *for generously sharing this sample with us!*\n\nBottle at 57.4% ABV, or 114.8 proof, and with a minimum of 13 years of aging, this Russell's Reserve bourbon is shaping up to be quite a tasty pour. The comments in the community seem to back that up - it's received almost universal acclaim, with no small share of reviewers naming it as one of the best bourbons they've had a chance to try.\n\nAvailability is the issue here - this is made in relatively small amounts, though we do seem to be getting batches with somewhat consistent timing. This bourbon can command some seriously high prices on the secondary market, though if you can get it for MSRP around $150, it's a better value proposition, considering its age and proof.\n\nThe bottle we're looking at is Batch 2, from the end of 2021.\n\n**Russell's Reserve 13 Year**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price at MSRP**: USD 150 (2023)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 290 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: 13 Years\n\n**Strength**: 57.4% ABV\n\n**Details**: Batch 2\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 1 month (from a sample bottle); bottle at 60% fill level at time of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Rich and deep dark sweetness, very richly oaked, with strong baking spices of cinnamon and brown sugar. Bits of toast and candied pecans come with time, and there's a whiff of barrel char or wood smoke; fruit isn't a dominant note, but we did get a hint of cherries. With more time to open up, we found savory barbecue, stronger vanilla, and raisins.\n\n**Palate**: A thick mouthfeel, with strong dusty oak again, which contributes some sharper spices like anise and clove, black pepper, maybe licorice, or even a cherry-licorice candy. Mature notes of tobacco and leather arrive in time, and then sweeter spices like cardamom and chai spices appear. There's a nutty character - peanuts, or maybe raw almonds, and then the fruit aspect increases on the back end - orange and some medicinal cherry.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-long, warm and oily and cozy, and that lingering oak is still the strongest flavor. Sweetness comes from syrupy brown sugar and semi-dry vanilla, but it's balanced by plenty of barrel spices like black pepper and tobacco smoke. There's an aftertaste of sweet red fruit.\n\n**Final Note**: Wow, this is a great bourbon. The age of the barrels allows the oak to become fully integrated, but it's never overwhelming; there's a great balance between the sweeter notes and the spicier notes. The mouthfeel is coating, and the high strength allows the flavors to be delivered at their full potential - this is very well made. One of the best bourbons we've tried, surely, and if you can find it as the suggested retail price, value isn't bad, either, which is unusual for a $100+ whisky.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 8.2 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\n\n**Value Rating (at MSRP)**: 6.21\n\n**About Us**: We're a husband and wife review team living in the Midwest United States.

Review #159 - Kilkerran Work In Progress 7th Release - Cask Strength Bourbon Wood,46,17m5xkr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17m5xkr,1698938581,,"[{'body': ""**Review #159 - Kilkerran Work In Progress 7th Release - Cask Strength Bourbon Wood**\r  \n\r  \n*A huge thanks to* u/whiskytrails *for generously sharing this sample with us!*\r  \n\r  \nWhile the Glengyle distillery was building their stocks up in anticipation of releasing regular age-stated products, they released several 'work in progress' whiskies along the way. This is one of them - the seventh release, in fact, from 2015 - and it's a cask strength bottling that was aged in ex-bourbon casks.\r  \n\r  \nStrength comes in at 54.1% ABV, and as always with this brand, there's no chill filtration or fake coloring to worry about. By the time that this was released, the distillery was 10 or 11 years old, so there may actually be some whisky in the mix that isn't especially young - we're guessing there's a range of ages in the recipe.\r  \n\r  \n**Kilkerran Work In Progress 7th Release - Cask Strength Bourbon Wood**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Campbeltown - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 367 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 54.1% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon casks\r  \n**Details**: 7th release, bottled 2015; not chill filtered, no color added; 6,000 bottles\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 1 month (from a sample bottle); bottle at 90% fill level at time of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Strong and quite woody, with a mixture of chemical, vegetal, and funk notes. There's sweetness from buttery brown sugar, but also some semi-savory mushroom, dry vanilla, and hay; sharper notes of pepper and balsamic come later.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium-thick mouthfeel, with more smoke and more sweetness: vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, and candied pecans are balanced by anise, black licorice candy, juniper twigs, and spiced oak. Later, it becomes more nutty, and we get cardamom and clove, along with a creamy texture.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Pleasantly warming, with hints of peat and strong oak - this is medium-long, and the texture is still creamy. Vanilla and honey give way to creme brulee, burnt sugar, almost a custard taste; there are bits of tangy yellow and orange fruit as well. The aftertaste is an interesting mixture of almond, sweet perfume, and melon.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Nice, not the most complex, but there's a solid underlying character that's hard to deny. After tasting the Kilkerran 12 Year, the lineage becomes more clear, and it seems they made a nice transition from these 'work in progress' bottlings to their 'final product' - they have that same strong Campbeltown character, with hints of umami and slightly funky notes. Price here is somewhat of a formality - as this is a long discontinued release, it's very hard to get ahold of these days, and therefore commands a pretty penny.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.3 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #158 - GlenAllachie 30 Year,50,17kmwdv,https://i.redd.it/rx3qq4mqxjxb1.jpg,1698764067,,"[{'body': ""**Review #158 - GlenAllachie 30 Year**\r  \n\r  \nWhen we saw this on the shelf at a local specialty bar, we had to give it a try - it's not often we get to try any 30+ year old single malt, especially from a distillery so 'in vogue' as GlenAllachie is right now. The price for a small pour was reasonable, so we pulled the trigger.\r  \n\r  \nThis bottle we tried is specifically from Batch 1 of their 30 year single malt, bottled in 2021 at a strength of 48.9% ABV. Because of the timing of this release, it definitely has Billy Walker's fingerprints on it - based on his usual style, and the history of GlenAllachie's spirit before Billy was involved, this probably spent the majority of its life aging in some tired casks before being re-racked into more potent wine casks for finishing. The third batch, currently available, employs PX, Oloroso, and virgin oak casks for finishing - we're guessing this first batch was similar.\r  \n\r  \n**GlenAllachie 30 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 1,006 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 30 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 48.9% ABV\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added; Batch 1, bottled 2021-04-15\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 40% fill level at time of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Very rich and dark - milk chocolate and tobacco to start, but soon we get concentrated orange oil and dark, inky red fruits, like strawberry and cherry. There's some molasses sugar, but also a musty, damp old oak, with a hint of wood polish.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium; still rich and oaky, with sharper tannins balanced by a creamy texture. Fruity notes come from tart cherry but also inky dark cherry, maybe some pomegranate, and a savory orange; with time, the polished old furniture oak from the nose reappears.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, subtle, and quite oily. The oak is drying and strong at this point, and there are aftertastes of tobacco and leather later on.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Really nice, and plenty of cask influence, although a lot of that may have come from those potent finishing casks. The dark red fruits point to some sherry cask maturation, but there are those nice semi-bitter tobacco notes that come mostly from longer wood maturation. Of course, the trick here is the price - unless you somehow manage to find one of these at a friendly retailer, you're looking at paying over $1,000; nothing in that range can be great value.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 8.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Hints of spirit still, but mixed with older oak notes, and we end with some burnt orange rind.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, very round and buttery, with a decent amount of oaky notes once again. Sugary brown syrup, vanilla bean, and then a bit of lemon comes in; at the end, pancakes with rum sauce.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: After seeing the popularity of this bottle online, and considering the price tag, we were hoping for a little more. It's a nice blend, with solid fruity tones in the nose and some richer baking spices and oak notes in the palate and finish, but the bottling strength does let this down a little bit. There's an interesting mix of mature flavor notes but also some spirity youth, so maybe this is a blend with components of a wide range of ages.

Luckily, we have a few friends with a bottle who were willing to share, and we were able to taste it at a couple of local bars, as well.\n\nThis is one of the reasonably priced 10 year old bourbons on the market, at least if you can find it around the MSRP, which is supposedly around $40 now.

Baking notes come in the form of light caramel; overall, it's a sweeter bourbon.\n\n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium, and we get more fruits to start: cherries again, and now strawberries, which add sweetness. More oak is present, and it adds some subtle astringency and nice spice like anise and nutmeg; caramel comes back later on. Nice and sippable, still sweet, but more balanced than the nose.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length, with more red fruits: cranberry juice and cherry are the most dominant, but now the oak is starting to add more sharpness, even a hint of acidity - there are some puckering feelings on the cheeks and tongue. Dark sweetness from molasses and caramel, and at the end, a light aftertaste of corn grain.\n\n**Final Note**: Nicely refined, very easy and pleasant to sip on, but not the most complex in the world. To be fair, it isn't really supposed to be - this is a bourbon that's had a MSRP in the $30 to $40 range over the last several years, just a step above 'entry level.' It has the classically sweet Buffalo Trace profile with nicely integrated oak and some great red fruit flavors.

Review #155 - Talisker Storm,43,17gy8l5,https://i.redd.it/0r8gq4398kwb1.jpg,1698331761,,"[{'body': ""**Review #155 - Talisker Storm**\r  \n\r  \nOne of the earlier examples from the new wave of NAS scotch popularity - Talisker Storm, a whisky that the brand wants us to know is made by the sea, and came about in 2013. In comparison to other Talisker expressions, Diageo claims that this specific malt was made to be the 'dark, smoky, more brooding member of the Talisker family.' They want us to look for wood spice and brine notes when we taste it, and presumably a slightly stronger peat influence than the typical 10 Year.\r  \n\r  \nCask types in this whisky are undisclosed, though we found hints online of 'refill' and 'rejuvenated' casks in the mix; strength is that classic 45.8% that we get with most Talisker whiskies. Again, there's no age statement, but rumors around the time of the release speculated that there was some very young whisky in the mix, as well as some quite old whisky; given the price point and Diageo's current pricing strategies, we're guessing there isn't much old stock left in here.\r  \n\r  \n**Talisker Storm**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 45 (2021)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 71 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 45.8% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 15 months; bottles at 100%, 90%, 50%, and 40% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Relatively peaty and coastal, with salt and some mossy rotten wood, like a damp bog; there's dry wood, too, hidden in the background. Vegetal, a bit of seaweed, but then lighter fruits of lemon and pear, maybe a hint of stone fruit. There's a significant heather or fresh hay scent, along with hints of vanilla and white pepper; we end with guava and orange.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium-thin mouthfeel, and a pretty mellow palate overall. Mild to medium peat levels, with some salt and a bit of peppery spice. Simple ex-bourbon flavors of oak and vanilla, maybe a hint of lemon sorbet, before more wood spice comes in the forms of cinnamon and anise. There are fruits like green grape and prune, but those are very mild; a bit of honey lingers later.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, mostly due to the peat, as some of the other flavors dissipate earlier. There's sweeter fruits of cherry and stone fruit, heather and honey, and a decent amount of citrus - moldy lemon, lime sherbet. Plenty of vanilla as well, along with that lingering hint of pepper spice.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Not bad, but the mouthfeel and mild complexity failed to deliver a more powerful or interesting experience. It's a pretty easy sipper, or 'smooth' if you like that term, once you get past the peat smoke at the front.

Review #154 - The Sassenach Blended Scotch,21,17fei2h,https://i.redd.it/b17m6iqox5wb1.jpg,1698158709,,"[{'body': ""**Review #154 - The Sassenach Blended Scotch**\r  \n\r  \nMeaning 'stranger' or 'outlander,' and generally referring to the English, the term 'Sassenach' now has some association with the book and television series 'Outlander.' On the back of the success of the series, one of the main actors in the series launched a blended scotch brand, and used the 'sassenach' term on the label.\r  \n\r  \nSo, a celebrity-branded spirit, and one with a premium price tag - a recipe for success? Well, it's gaining some popularity, especially with fans of the book and television series, but we're not particularly concerned with that. We want to know: how is the liquid inside the bottle?\r  \n\r  \nAnd... what is the liquid in the bottle? It's a blended scotch, so we can assume there's a mixture of malt and grain whisky here. There's no reference, however, to the source of the spirit - in fact, there's really no transparency at all, unlike many of the new whisky brands that have launched in the last five or ten years. We do get a strength of 46% ABV, at least, so there's one positive.\r  \n\r  \nThe only real information we get on the brand's website is a bunch of marketing jargon, like you might expect: lots of 'awards' have been won, it has 'distinct character' and 'smooth flavor,' and it's inspired by that rugged highland landscape. It's supposedly a limited edition of some sort, but it first became available more than two years ago, and it's still hanging around shelves near us...\r  \n\r  \n**The Sassenach Blended Scotch**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland - Blend*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 120 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 3 months; bottles at 90% and 50% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Gentle, supple sweetness, but not overdone in that respect. There's a hint of a sherry cask, but mostly we get green apple and ripe pear, some white grape and wine. Hints of black pepper give just a slight kick, but this is generally very mellow.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Warm and sweet, but a medium-thin mouthfeel. Fruit is again the dominant theme - red fruits like some sherry, but also crisp apple and grape. A bit of baked goods like bread or biscuits, a light, toasty oak influence, and a soft barrel spice... the sweetness subsides later to become more balanced.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-short in length, and mellow, with not too much going on. Again, apples and pears and some pale oak are the core flavors; later, hints of baking spice and tannins.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Well, they lauded this as a 'smooth' whisky on their website, and they've nailed it - this is inoffensive, single-lane, and slightly bland. The flavors aren't inherently bad, but it's very simple and comes across as weaker than its 46% ABV would make us expect. As for value - because this is a product with celebrity-heavy branding, they're demanding quite a premium for it.

It's a bit inky with some mild wine flavor, and then lighter fruits of lemon citrus and candied oranges come through. Damp earth after a rain, a driftwood campfire on the beach, and medicinal character are all relatively strong; the oak gets a lot stronger with time.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A bit oily with a medium thickness mouthfeel, and plenty of peat once again - strongly medicinal, and then it quickly takes on an ashy campfire character, with the strong oak influence adding a wood smoke element. Light fruits of lemon and orange, then red fruits, and then a green vegetal flavor behind those. Bits of vanilla and black pepper, but also a savory sauce - this had a lot going on.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, with plenty of peat and oil hanging around the palate, though it isn't overwhelmingly smoky. Lots of coastal salt notes and plenty of oak, and a bit of orange and red fruit in the aftertaste; even later, hints of peppered barbecue on the grill.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This was a solid Laphroaig - plenty of the medicinal peaty character that you would expect, with the nice additions of fruit and a strong oak note. Not the most complex dram in the world, but it is well-rounded with the variety of flavors.

The big bother of the bottled-in-bond bourbon from Dueling Grounds that we looked at in our 79th review, this is bottled at a hefty 60.5% ABV, or 121 proof, after 4 years of oak maturation.\n\n**Linkumpinch Single Barrel Cask Strength Bourbon**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 70 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: 4 Years\n\n**Strength**: 60.5% ABV\n\n**Details**: Barrel #71\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 3 months; bottles at 90%, 80%, and 60% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Dense, rich, dark - chocolate and molasses show up first, but we soon find some subtle darker fruit, like overripe strawberry or cherry. Spicy barrel char and some leather are mixed with sharper spices like anise and some cinnamon. Hints of wood smoke and dry vanilla, then bits of salted caramel as well... quite heavy on the oak despite 4 years of aging.\n\n**Palate**: Rich and dense again, with a thick mouthfeel, and lots of syrupy oak. Sweeter notes of molasses and brown sugar, before oak and spice overwhelms: black pepper and white pepper, nutmeg, clove, and wood char are all here. There's a whiff of wood smoke like the remains of a day-old campfire: ashy, and then some spicy tobacco comes in. Again, the oak overwhelms a bit, especially considering the age.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-long, with hints of dark fruits, but a lot of baking spice as the main flavor profile. Brown sugar, anise, vanilla, and clove are all plentiful, with accents of cardamom and hot pepper. Quite warm now, with heat lingering in the back of the throat for some time.\n\n**Final Note**: Solid strength and sweetness before the spices, but it's walking the line of over-oaking, even at four years old. Any chance this was possibly aged in some smaller barrels? We're not sure, but the oaky spice notes can be a little overwhelming. Still, this has some solid darker flavors - it's better than your average bourbon for sure, at least in our minds. Quite limited production means it can be hard to come by unless you're near the distillery, but at the $70 we've seen it sold for, not a bad pickup.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 6.3 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Situated near the River Lossie in Speyside, this is an unpeated single malt - a single cask, in fact - that was aged for 10 years in a first-fill ex-bourbon barrel.\r  \n\r  \nLike the vast majority of the Society\'s bottlings, this is presented at cask strength (56.7% ABV, in this case), and as always, there\'s no chill filtration or coloring added. The cask yielded 240 bottles, and it was distilled in 2011.\r  \n\r  \n**SMWS 71.83 ""Amuse Your Bouche"" - Glenburgie 10 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 110 (2022)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: No longer available\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 56.7% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: First-fill ex-bourbon barrel\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added; distilled July 11, 2011; 1 of 240 bottles\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 6 months; bottles at 100%, 80%, and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Bright with some sharper, clean spirit up front, before soft oak and strong baking spices flood in. Brown sugar, melted butter, cinnamon applesauce, and vanilla are all here - a hint of nuttiness, too, before some light lemon zest. With more time, the oak becomes slightly perfume but also sharp, and there\'s some sweet, juicy pear.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Strong and a bit spirity again, with a thick mouthfeel - it\'s very oily. Plenty of orchard fruits are here: lemon and orange, some sweet green apples or applesauce; there\'s a hint of watermelon at times. With more air time, juicy plum and nectarines come to the forefront, followed by those baking spices from the nose - vanilla bean, cinnamon sugar, and a hint of nutmeg. On the back end, dry oak and light honey.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Warm, medium length, with plenty of oaky spice. Black pepper and anise add some sharper tones, while vanilla and cinnamon balance it with sweetness. There\'s just a hint of peach on the back end, but this mostly sticks to the spices.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Decent whisky, solid, but nothing too special. The cask strength presentation definitely allows this to convey plenty of punchy flavor, but those flavors are generally contained to orchard fruit and baking spices, without a ton of depth or nuance.

Caramel apples and vanilla bean ice cream bring more sweetness, and there are subtle flavors of hay and salt.

Take whiskybase for example, there are tons of whiskies that get 90pt averages that don\'t always work for everyone because they are skewed to the audience that actively posts scores on whiskybase. Same also applies to web reviewers like Serge Valentin or Whiskynotes, they are very knowledgeable and provide respectable notes and reviews but their tastes don\'t always align with everyone\'s because of their experiences and what styles and attributes they weigh more than others.

Acquired by Diageo relatively recently, this distillery has been on the cutting edge of new whisky trends in the Lone Star state since 2009, when it was started in an old welding shop in Waco.\n\nBalcones offers a huge variety of spirits: a Pot Still Bourbon, 100 Proof Rye, Baby Blue (Blue Corn), Brimstone (scrub oak smoked corn whisky), a 'classic edition' single malt, and innumerable special/limited releases, along with the whisky we're looking at today - The Lineage American single malt. It's made from a mixture of Texas-grown and Scottish-grown malted barley.\n\nLike many whiskies from Texas, the maturation time isn't huge, due to the risk of over-oaking the spirit quite quickly. In this case, we get fine print on the back of the bottle which specifies this whisky has spent at least 36 months in oak, so a 3 year age statement. Both new charred oak and refill oak are used, supposedly to blend the styles of Texas whisky and traditional Scottish single malts.\n\nOur journey through American single malts has taken us up and down, up and down - this is the first we've tried from Texas. Will this be one of the better ones the blossoming category has to offer, or will it fall flat?\n\n**Balcones Lineage**\n\n*USA - Single Malt*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 42 (2022)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 42 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: 3 Years\n\n**Strength**: 47% ABV\n\n**Details**: Batch SML20-3\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 7 months; bottles at 100%, 90%, 80%, and 50% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Quite grainy - malty and young, with barley sugar, brown sugar, and some clove. There's plenty of vanilla - that's the focus here - and then some young, dry oak, which turns slightly savory later. A hint of acetone/alcohol is present in the smells, and later, oats and honey come forward.\n\n**Palate**: Medium mouthfeel, with quite a bit of oak up front - slightly astringent or sour, but then some sweeter wood sugars and vanilla come forward. Hints of orange peel and carbonated cream soda come and go, and the whole experience is pretty warm. On the back of the palate, more spice: cayenne pepper, anise, and more oak tannins mixed with dusty grain.\n\n**Finish**: Warm, oaky, and the complexion softens a bit. The wood is lighter, with just hints of dry tannins, and the vanilla turns almost to an imitation vanilla. There are hints of metallic notes and molasses, freshly baked bread, nutmeg, and cayenne; the vanilla continues to sweeten, turning to vanilla bean ice cream.\n\n**Final Note**: Young and grainy - it's hard to get away from the heavy oak influence despite the short maturation time. Some will enjoy that about Texas whiskies, but for us, the length of aging hasn't been long enough to tame the raw spirit notes, or to allow more complex flavors to develop. Relatively simple, but not a bad whisky, just a bit average; it's unlikely we'll pick up another bottle, given how many choices there are to try out there.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 5.3 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\n\n**Value Rating**: 6.06\n\n**About Us**: We're a husband and wife review team living in the Midwest United States.

Heavily peated like the other Kilchoman whiskies, and there's no age statement, but we're guessing the whisky is generally between 4 and 8 years old, like a lot of new-age distillery NAS bottlings.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the reasons we love Kilchoman is their commitment to natural whisky - everything avoids chill filtration and added coloring, and it's always at or above 46% ABV, so we know there should be enough flavor packed in for an engaging experience. They're transparent about their processes and their ingredients, and we hope more of the industry moves in that direction.\r  \n\r  \n**Kilchoman Machir Bay**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 65 (2022)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 67 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: 90% ex-bourbon casks, 10% ex-Oloroso sherry casks\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 2 months; bottles at 100%, 80%, and 60% fill levels at times of review.

There's lemon, or lemon-lime soda, lime sherbet, granulated sugar, even some agave; it can be a bit tart or dry, with some mild oak, along with plenty of younger spirit influence. With more time, dry hay and a mild barbecue note come forward.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Sweet and sour citrus fruit, lemon drop candies, peaches - this is nice and bright and tart, like the nose. The smoke comes to the forefront - it's strong, with a slightly ashy character, though not too much. There's a bit of buttery oak and some tangy barbecue, and softer notes like white wine and baked bread are hidden in the background; the mouthfeel has a medium thickness. At the end of the palate, there's a spiced heat from jalapenos.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, especially with ashy peat smoke lingering. There are some mild savory notes, but the strongest flavors (other than peat) are citrus fruits: oranges, lemon candies, watery lemonade, and then a hint of nectarine or peach on the back end.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Perfect entry to the brand, but not a perfect whisky - it's raw, bright, spirit-driven, but has had enough maturation time to develop solid fruit notes. Oak influence isn't particularly strong in the tasting notes, and we enjoyed that spicy jalapeno flavor on the palate. This is a good whisky, and while $65 or so isn't cheap for NAS whisky, it's on par with the pricing scheme that most other new distilleries are using - value is decent, then.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

We're looking at their standard 12 Year release - possibly not their entry level malt, considering the existence of the Virgin Oak release. This is bottled at 46.3% ABV and isn't chill filtered, so we're getting nice specs from Distell, the distillery's owners.\r  \n\r  \nThe label states that this is aged in ex-bourbon barrels, although, as we'll discuss in our tasting notes below, we found a very balanced character, almost hinting at some sherry casks. Maybe that's some savory, solid character in their distillate coming through instead? A little bit of a head scratcher for us, but this was our first Deanston bottle, so we still have plenty to learn about them.\r  \n\r  \n**Deanston 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 65 (2021)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 69 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46.3% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon casks\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 2 years; bottles at 100%, 80%, 40% (blind tasting), and 30% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review.

There's fruit as well: green and red apples, orange, almost fig like some sherry influence, some sharper notes from lemon and nectarine. In the oak, we find a nuttiness and spice, even peppercorns and leather; overall, this is pretty balanced, not straying too far in any one flavor direction.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Ex-bourbon orchard fruits and baking spices: orange, green apple and cinnamon which combine for a crisp apple pie, white pepper, plenty of vanilla, nutmeg; there's dry oak again, some burnt sugar, brown sugar, and even licorice. Mouthfeel is medium, and again, just a hint of spirit character lingering, but not too strong.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length or so, with those same baking spices dominating: vanilla is the strongest, but we also get anise and simple syrup along with more apples. The finish is more dry than the palate - a hint of sharp oak and dry hay are here, and we end with a grapefruit aftertaste.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: For us, this is solid, but nothing about it really sticks out to make it interesting. We had slightly higher expectations based on what we read online in the whisky community, but when we taste it, it's just... fine? A few nice flavor notes, but the overall experience is a little too rounded and flat. In more recent times, we've had the opportunity to taste other, more individualistic Deanston offerings (Deanston 20 Year Oloroso and Deanston 2008 PX, for example), and we've seen how much character they can have; spoiler alert: it's a lot.

Using the Granty Burn water source and worm tub condensers, this spirit is supposed to be clean and crisp, but also weighty and rich. Will that body be able to overcome the low bottling strength?\r  \n\r  \n**Speyburn 10 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 30 (2023)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 30 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 40% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: American ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 4 months; bottles at 90%, 70% (blind tasting), and 50% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Mild red fruit and sherry notes, like orange and raisin, but the stars here are baking spices and light fruits: vanilla, white pepper from the oak, butterscotch, and then green apple, passionfruit, and creamy mango. There's a hint of a cherry around the top of the glass, too, and just a bit of spirit character still peeking through. Despite all of the nice fruit notes, the overall experience is very mild and mellow - the lower strength definitely shows here.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Light and delicate - a thin mouthfeel for sure, as expected with the bottling strength. It is decently fruity, with grape, red apples, lemon, and tart pineapple rind, but there's also wood spice, clove, nutmeg, and butterscotch once more. Actually, a pretty interesting palate: we get a light umami note, maybe a remnant from those worm tub condensers, as well as minerality and some soft flora: flowers, grass, and thyme.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-short, again suffering from the lack of strength. It's mild but balanced, with orange rind, lots of bananas, just lots of creamy tropical fruits in general. There's a bit of chardonnay, as well as darker notes of prunes and spiced candies.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Honestly, a little better than expected. When spending $30 on a single malt, our expectations aren't particularly high, but we've heard a lot of positive press around the 15 year Speyburn expression recently, so we figured we'd give the brand a try. There are definitely interesting flavors here - nice fruits, nice spices, and the occasional floral, mineral, or savory notes. That said, it is definitely neutered by this bottling strength... it comes across as mild is all phases of the tasting, and the finish is especially lackluster in length. Still, at $30, it's a good value pick - it's about the cheapest OB single malt we can buy in our area.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 6.2 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

It's distilled and aged in Indiana, though - a pretty good likelihood, then, that we're tasting some MGP distillate.\n\nThere's no statement on the length of maturation, but we do get a solid ABV of 54% (or 108 proof), so there should at least be punchy flavors and a solid mouthfeel to look forward to.

Herbal and chemical as the nose opens up, almost like a rye - then nail polish remover, grain, slightly earthy and nutty. There's a hint of orange and mild vanilla, some bitter caramel, hay... all over the place.\n\n**Palate**: Medium mouthfeel, with sweet notes like molasses and vanilla, along with wood char and barrel spice. The chemical/herbal notes from the nose come back stronger - they're starting to take over the experience. Earthy, eucalyptus, nail polish remover, and flowers, young spirit notes; then, we do find some caramel and grain, along with clove and cardamom.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-long, with lingering warmth from the ABV and some peppery charcoal. Slightly mineral and still herbal/flowery, with a hint of that chemical character lingering. There's butterscotch and soft vanilla on the sweeter side, and this mellows out to become mild overall.\n\n**Final Note**: With all of the herbal spice notes, this almost drinks more like a rye than a single malt; there are a few nice sweet flavors with the baking spices and caramel, but much of the experience is dominated by the young, chemical, grainy character, especially in the palate.

Review #144 - Westland American Oak Single Malt,22,16vd62p,https://i.redd.it/wll5nkcyf7rb1.jpg,1695997727,,"[{'body': ""**Review #144 - Westland American Oak Single Malt**\n\nOne of the distilleries taking center stage in the new wave of American single malt whiskies, Westland started operations back in 2010, specializing solely in single malts, unlike the majority of American whisky distilleries. They've been one of the leaders of the charge to formalize the rules for the American single malt category, pushing for standards such as a 100% malted barley mashbill.\n\nBefore they began producing their current core range release, the Westland American Single Malt (the one with 'Thoughtfully Made' printed at the top of the label), they began with a series of three core releases: an American Oak aged release, a sherry cask matured release, and a peated single malt release.\n\nToday we're looking at the 'American Oak' release - while they're no longer producing it, there's still plenty floating around shelves. There's no smoky peat or sweet sherry cask maturation, just single malt distillate aged in new charred American oak for a minimum of three years.\n\nAs is common nowadays in the single malt whisky market (both in the US and abroad, and especially in Scotch), this is bottled at 46% ABV, pushing this toward the 'craft' bottling standards that many whisky enthusiasts are asking for.\n\n**Westland American Oak Single Malt**\n\n*USA - Single Malt*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 70 (2021)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 71 (2023) \n\n**Age Statement**: 3 Years\n\n**Strength**: 46% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 18 months; bottles at 100%, 80%, 50%, and 90% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Rich, juicy, and malty - this is barley-forward, even for a single malt. The fruitier notes comes from cherries and sweet red wine, along with a hint of grape; the oak is plentiful despite the 3 year age, and comes with notes of char and hickory. Sweet baking spices of brown sugar, caramel, and maple sugar are here; later, that malty note transitions to a strong chocolate flavor: chocolate syrup, even spiced Mexican chocolate.\n\n**Palate**: Mega malty chocolate, tons of dark sweet flavors. The mouthfeel is medium, and there's a definite oiliness, with molasses and smooth syrup. We do get a bit of spice up front, like cinnamon, paprika, maybe black pepper, but this generally dives into those chocolatey flavors: milk chocolate, malty milkshake, tootsie rolls, and that fake chocolate syrup. There are hints of cherry still floating around, and later, just a hint of barbecue and cardamom.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length, still oily and sweet: chocolate, malt, brown sugar, and chocolate-covered cherries. There's still a hint of hot cinnamon spice, and at the end, another whiff of black pepper.\n\n**Final Note**: The longer this is open, the better and better it gets; our ratings consistently trended upward with time. Drinks richer than the 46% bottling strength, and if you like a whisky with a malty note, this has it in spades. Very chocolatey, and a surprising amount of red fruit for a whisky with no aging in ex-wine casks. There are a lot of mediocre American single malts on the market right now, but this isn't one of them - this is solid stuff, and recommended if you're looking for an introduction to the category.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 6.7 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

This is a mix of four of the Four Roses recipes: OBSK, OBSO, OESK, and OESO. Based on the tasting notes from their website, we'll be looking at a combination of tasting notes including: rye spice, rich fruit, baking spices, and some vanilla.\n\nThis is presented at 45% ABV, and it's chill-filtered, but we're hoping there's still some mouthfeel left in the whisky. No statement about an age on the bottle, either, but their website gives an estimate of 6 to 7 years of maturation - that's at least a decent amount of time for this to develop some more complex flavors.\n\n**Four Roses Small Batch**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 30 (2020)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 28 (2023) \n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 45% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 2 years; bottles at 20% and 50% fill levels at times of review.

There's cinnamon and vanilla, balanced by more oak tannins, before an oatmeal aftertaste lingers.\n\n**Final Note**: This is a bit on the reserved and mild side - the nose took a while to show much flavor, and the palate didn't deliver too much of a mouthfeel.

Review #142 - Russell's Reserve 10 Year,37,16tm8iq,https://i.redd.it/cj37fik37tqb1.jpg,1695825244,,"[{'body': 'Keep in mind that there was a flavor profile change in in 2022.  Those medicinal cherry notes are sadly (for me) gone.  I hoarded a couple of bottles of "" original recipe"" and sip them sparingly.  Don\'t give me wrong, the current blend is still my favorite low-proof warm up.  Especially at this price.\n\nMore explanation here:  https://rarebird101.com/2022/05/11/russells-reserve-10-year-2022/', 'score': 13}, {'body': ""**Review #142 - Russell's Reserve 10 Year**\n\nFrom the Wild Turkey distillery, we have the Russell's Reserve brand, named for Jimmy and Eddie Russell - this is the entry point on the bourbon side, a 10 year age stated Kentucky bourbon bottle at 45% ABV. It's aged in #4 'alligator' char barrels, so we should be getting plenty of oak notes.\n\nThe real draw here is the value: many other 10 year old bourbons demand a huge premium price tag, though there are a couple others (Eagle Rare, for example) that keep it reasonable. This one beats pretty much all competition on price, though: in our area, this is $30 to $35, and can even be found below $30 on the occasional sale. It's available everywhere, too, which is an added bonus.\n\n**Russell's Reserve 10 Year**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 29 (2021)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 32 (2023) \n\n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\n\n**Strength**: 45% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 10 months; bottles at 100%, 50%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Oaky and sweet up front, with cola and syrupy cherry, then brown sugar and caramel. There's a soft nutty character, almost dusty peanuts, but more sweet flavors overwhelm: vanilla bean, mild milk chocolate, even Maraschino liqueur. Around the glass, we do find the occasional spice like anise or nutmeg, and the oak takes on a dusty character, along with some dry corn husk.\n\n**Palate**: Balanced and buttery-smooth up front, with a medium mouthfeel at most. There's still decent sweetness, with caramel, cherry syrup, and molasses; the oak is strong and occasionally slightly bitter, with a peppery and mildly tannic influence. Vanilla and red fruits come and go, and on the back end, more pepper and some licorice.\n\n**Finish**: Cola, cherries, and vanilla take center stage; this has a medium length finish, and the focus shifts later toward baking spices. There's an aftertaste of dry oak tannins and dusty grain, or even a grist from freshly ground corn.\n\n**Final Note**: This is a solid, but generally plain bourbon, at least in our experience. Nothing offensive, but not the most complex flavor development considering it spent ten years maturing in oak; still, it's nice and sweet, and quite easy-drinking. It's a solid entry point to the brand, and because of the price, quite good value. In search of more complex flavors, though, we'll continue looking elsewhere.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 5.9 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

It immediately fit into one of our favorite flavor profiles: strongly peated spirit and sweet cask maturation, in this case a large proportion of Oloroso sherry casks.\r  \n\r  \nLike all of Kilchoman's bottlings, we have good stats: no chill filtration, no added coloring, and everything has a strength of 46%+ ABV. They state it all plainly on the label, too - truly one of the new wave of craft distilleries that are emerging all over Scotland.\r  \n\r  \nKilchoman started operations in 2005, meaning that we could be getting close to 20 year old spirit in some of their first casks, if they're still hanging around. Still, in these widely available whiskies, there's no age statement on the bottle - we're guessing that they're using a similar strategy to many of the other newer distilleries, and the liquid we're tasting is mostly between 5 and 8 years old. That isn't a bad thing for heavily peated, heavily sherried whisky, though - those powerful, delicious flavors will still be more punchy without decades in a cask mellowing them out.\r  \n\r  \n**Kilchoman Sanaig**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 65 (2021)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 74 (2023) \r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Vatting of ex-bourbon and ex-Oloroso sherry casks\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 16 months; bottles at 100%, 70%, 30% (blind tasting), and 20% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Medium to strong peat smoke up front, with some slightly medicinal character, but also salt, seaweed, and kelp flavors. Lots of barbecue flavors take center stage: salami, greasy sausage, wood smoke, dry rub meats and some black pepper. Accenting the savory notes are fruits like strawberry and raspberry jam, with some sweet red wine, too. With more time to open up, there's iodine and ash in the smoke, as well as malty grain and a vegetal, musty character.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Mouthfeel has a medium thickness, and there's more spice now: red pepper flakes, jalapenos and bell peppers, some sharper wood char, and black pepper barbecue. The peat is medium strength, and there's more oak and sea salt now with the oily character of the spirit. Sweetness arrives in the form of barbecue sauce and orange fruit, and some mild sugary vanilla later on.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, and the peat keeps its medium influence for a while. Spicy and oily, with black pepper, sausage, campfire smoke, and hot salsa as the dominant notes. Fruit comes in as a secondary layer, with orange, strawberries, cherries, and peach all contributing subtle flavors; warmth lingers in the back of the throat for a long time.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Very nice whisky, well balanced and showing plenty of vigor. The peat is never overwhelming, but contributes throughout the tasting experience as it accents the fruit and spicy barbecue notes. This is a classic example of sherry-matured peaty Islay whisky, and while $70 to $75 isn't cheap, we still find this to be a pretty good value in that realm.

I appreciate the feedback, really. I think there\'s a lot of different things I could explore here:\n\n* The reason we get certain numbers more often is just due to rounding we take the average score from several tasting sessions for each whisky, and in those tasting sessions, we generally give whole number score. We never taste something and think \'this is a solid 6.8\'\n   * We round to a decimal point just because we feel it\'s a little more telling - a 6.6 and a 7.4 score would both round to 7 if we used integers, but to us, there\'s a real difference between a whisky we would score a 6.6 vs 7.4\n   * We try to do 3-4 tastings of a whisky before writing a final verdict, so relatively often, we end up with an average of 4 scores. Often, this will result in an average score of X.25 or X.75, which we would round to X.3 or X.8, which is why scores ending in .3 or .8 generally show up a little more often\n* A lot of the whiskies we rate are entry-level, widely available whiskies - they aren\'t necessarily meant to be amazing or terrible. I would argue that the majority of single malts priced between $45 and $90 do fall in the decent, but not exceptional range, but that\'s only my opinion/general experience, no sort of rule\n* We\'re relatively informed (I want to stress relatively - we are by no means experts, and don\'t intend to come across that way) about whisky at this point, and we have a general idea about whiskies that are not very good - we don\'t really buy many whiskies we know are bad because we don\'t have unlimited funds, and don\'t want to waste our money (or our liver capacity) just for the sake of drinking a quarter of a bottle to post a review. That\'s one reason that we don\'t have a lot of low scoring whisky reviews - we generally would try something of lower quality at a bar if at all, and it takes longer to build up a set of 3-4 tastings to compile an accurate review that way, so they occur less often\n* Related to the prior point - there are a lot of whiskies that are extremely good, but also prohibitively expensive to buy, and we don\'t have unlimited funds, so we taste those less often, and therefore will have enough data to write a review of them less often. We\'ve absolutely tasted whiskies we would rate between a 9 and 10, but if it\'s some $500 bottle that no one on the subreddit is likely to ever seen, we don\'t see as much value in posting a review of it\n* When we score something a 7, which we call \'good\', we think of that more like ""Wow, that\'s good."" Just because something has a score of 5 or 6 or so, doesn\'t mean it\'s \'bad,\' just that it didn\'t impress us to the point of moving to that next level tasting experience. There are TONS of decent, solid, whiskies in the 5.5 to 6.9 scoring range that we would happily recommend, especially if they\'re good value. That\'s part of the subjectivity of the scoring, and definitely something we could do a better job explaining in our scoring system; maybe we need to change our description of a 5 rating to something like ""Average, in a good way""\n* The first 100 reviews we completed were with a slightly different scoring scale, which brought about a lot more ratings like 8.0, which is why there are a lot of those in the past\n\nSort of went on a rant there, sorry lol. But I hope this gives a little insight to our process. At the end of the day, it\'s all a bit subjective, and I think that navigating the different rating scales (even on the same numerical scale) people use in whisky reviewing is all part of the process - if we can find someone\'s ratings that align with ours, then we can use their judgment as a guide to tasting new things, and when it\'s worth it to spend the money on it\n\n*Edit: Ah, I totally forgot one of the most important parts. Since we try to always use an average of several scores from different tasting sessions, this will naturally lead to more average scores: if we try a whisky one time and it seems great, but another time is just seems ‘fine,’ the rating will come somewhere in between; the more we taste a whisky, the less likely a score is to stray really high or really low.

Review #140 - Ardnamurchan AD/,26,16pb7bu,https://i.redd.it/p2ytjot6dtpb1.jpg,1695391474,,"[{'body': 'I had never heard of this brand until quite recently but it seems to be popping up everywhere. I gather the brand has been “on tour” in the US, which I think is generating a bit of the buzz.\n\nI’ve seen enough to put it on my short list of single malt distilleries I’m keen to try. \n\nThanks for the review.', 'score': 3}, {'body': ""**Review #140 - Ardnamurchan AD/**\r  \n\r  \nAt a tasting event earlier this year, we had a chance to try Ardnamurchan's AD/ whisky, along with cask samples of all of the spirit types that make up these 'blends' or batches. We were already fans of the distillery, but this experience gave us a chance to really dive into the details of their raw spirit, something we haven't had a chance to do with very many brands. The verdict at the end of the tasting was clear: quality whisky, invariably interesting, and ever-changing due to the relative youth of the distillery.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the great things about this distillery is their commitment to transparency - all of their releases are at a strength above 46% ABV, there's no added coloring or chill filtration, and each bottle sports a QR code on the back label that gives you amazingly detailed statistics about the makeup of your specific batch. For instance, here is the data for our bottle:\r  \n\r  \n\\- This is bottle 249 out of 7,500 in this batch\r  \n\\- The barley in our batch (ADCB022201) is of the Concerto variety, grown in Brucefield on Broomhall Farm\r  \n\\- The mash water temperatures were 65C, 80C, and 91C\r  \n\\- The fermentation took 76 hours\r  \n\\- Spirit cut points were from 74% to 70%, and the spirit went into the cask at 63.5%\r  \n\\- The batch is made up of 25 casks: 12 peated and 13 unpeated; 4 were hogsheads, 2 were butts, and the remaining 19 were ASBs; vintages ranged from 2014 to 2016 on the casks\r  \n\r  \nThey even gave us the individual numbers for each cask, but we're drowning in details here, so we'll omit those. A silly amount of detailed information, really, but we admire their willingness to share.\r  \n\r  \nBased on those vintages, we can estimate that the whisky in this bottle is generally between 5 and 7 years old, and like all of their standard AD/ releases, this is a mix of both peated and unpeated spirit, as well as ex-bourbon maturation and ex-sherry maturation. We enjoyed the earlier batch release product AD/ 03.21:02... how will this one compare, now that it's under the standard label?\r  \n\r  \n**Ardnamurchan AD/**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 61 (2023)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 61 (2023) \r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 46.8% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 3 months; bottles at 30%, 70% (blind tasting), 60% (blind tasting), and 50% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Salt and pepper: sea brine, white pepper, black pepper, slightly ashy. The peat here is mild, building toward a medium level, and the whole experience is very oily and coastal. There's a little bit of a farmyard funkiness, with hay, earth, even a sort of inky character; fruits aren't really the focus of this nose, but we do get hints of candied pear and a mild sherry wine note. Brown baking spices and brown sugar are more influential, and there's a hint of savory brisket when it's had more air time.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Balanced, with elements of both sweet and dry. There's a medium peat smoke level, along with black pepper and brine, but also buttery oak and toast, seedy fig, lemon, and lime. There's still a dirty, farmy side to this, but it's hidden behind lots of savory flavors: salt, barbecue, smoked meats, and wood smoke. With more time to oxidize, sweeter notes of plum and Luxardo cherry creep forward; the mouthfeel is medium, bordering medium-thick.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Salty, peppery, dry vanilla and some oily brine. The finish is medium-long, with just a mild peat still remaining; mostly, we're getting butterscotch and bitter burnt caramel, some sweeter lemon citrus here and there. There's a bit of dried grass or hay once more, and the lingering aftertaste is lime flavored sherbet.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Another solid Ardnamurchan - this is a great entry to the brand. It showcases that Western Highland character, while giving us enough depth to explore as well: flavors of fruits, baking spices, mild smoke, and spirit character all find harmony in the liquid.

Despite this being young, NAS whisky, all of the releases so far seem to be high quality and have solid character. Everything (including this bottle) is at 46.8% ABV or higher, and there's no use of artificial coloring or chill filtration - all good things.\r  \n\r  \nThis release is one of the earlier batched releases, before Ardnamurchan began releasing under a consistent entry-level label (the AD/ - we're looking at that one tomorrow). Let's decode this name: 03 is the month of March, 21 is the year 2021, and 02 is the batch number in the year. So this was the 2nd batch of Ardnamurchan spirit released in 2021, which was blended and bottled in the month of March. This is one of the earlier releases from the distillery - their inaugural batch release was in September 2020. Once their stocks reached a sustainable level and they had perfected a recipe, they ditched this naming convention in favor of the standard 'AD/.'\r  \n\r  \nLike most of their core releases, this is a mixture of both peated and unpeated spirit, as well as ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks. This might lead us to a balanced flavor profile, but we're also expecting some youth - most of the whisky in this bottle is probably four to six years old.\r  \n\r  \n**Ardnamurchan AD/ 03.21:02**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 70 (2021)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 61 (2023 - for a comparable release) \r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 46.8% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks\r  \n**Details:** Not chill filtered, no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 5 times over 12 months; bottles at 100%, 90% (blind tasting), 70%, 60%, and 40% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Where to start? This is a classic 'West Highland' single malt as we've come to know it: salt and sea spray, damp wood, heathery, a soft peat tickle; there's green moss, but also brighter fruits of lemon, lime candies, maybe some pear. Sweetness arrives from vanilla and creme brulee/burnt sugar, and there's just a hint of wine influence, but this seems heavy on the ex-bourbon maturation. The oak is subdued and musty, and there's a definite baking element: fresh baked bread, malty sugars, some chili powder or paprika. Occasional notes of honey, bitter butterscotch, and dried grass appeared in individual tastings.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Dry on the palate - a medium mouthfeel, with barrel spice, more oak, acidic lemon, and white pepper. Vegetal moss and dried grass were more prominent, and some of that oily coastal salt is woven into the whole experience. Baking spices of vanilla and cinnamon arrive in the mid palate, along with a light to medium peat smoke influence. More tart lemon: lemonade, tart lemon candies, and a little bit of spirity youth pokes through; later, a hint of lavender perfume and flowers, along with mild raisin and some yeasty character.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length or so, oily and a pleasant warmth permeating the experience. Soft oak, still on the dry and acidic side, with apples and lemon, as well. There's a hint of malty milk chocolate, maybe some orange and prune fruits, but this stays generally dry: sawdust, white pepper, and a soft peat tickle lingers. At the end, an aftertaste of vanilla, cane sugar, and creme brulee brings back the faintest sweet side.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is a solid entry from a young distillery; actually, Ardnamurchan is going on 10 years old now, and they've becomes so celebrated in the whisky enthusiast community in the last couple of years, we almost can't call them newcomers. While there are soft reminders of youth in the palate, this whisky feels more mature than it likely is; we can't wait to see how this liquid tastes when there are 10 or 15 year old releases (we expect it will be sublime). Great character with the salt and pepper, sort of a coastal dryness, and the varying light fruits add a nice layer of complexity.

It's an affordable, supposedly solid rye that's bottled in bond, so it comes in at a strength of 50% ABV (100 proof), meaning it can stand up to other ingredients in a cocktail. Mrs. Reviewer actually spent some time bartending at a craft cocktail bar, and this was their go-to rye for most whisky-based drinks.\n\nRittenhouse is made at the Heaven Hill distillery in Kentucky, but it takes its name from Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. There's no age statement on the bottle, but because of the 'bottled-in-bond designation,' we know that this has been aged for at least four years; that's backed up on the distillery's website, where they state it plainly.\n\n**Rittenhouse Rye**\n\n*USA - Rye*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 25 (2022)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 25 (2023) \n\n**Age Statement**: 4 Years\n\n**Strength**: 50% ABV\n\n**Details**: Bottled in bond\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 18 months; bottles at 50%, 100%, and 30% fill levels at times of review.

A little bit of spice, too, like cardamom, pepper, and some anise. There is oak influence but it's soft, and there's an herbal side to this, although not as strong as other young ryes. Later, nutmeg and a hint of tangy barbecue, and we end with a hint of ethanol.\n\n**Palate**: Reflects the nose pretty well: the mouthfeel has a medium thickness, and there's mild cherry and some dry caramel bringing sweetness, along with sweeter baking spices. The sharper spice comes from white pepper, dry oak, and a slightly chemical eucalyptus; the oak is a little stronger now, with bits of fresh lumber. With more time, a spicy grain note comes forward.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length; balanced again, with warming oak. It's rounded and buttery, with a bit of sweet syrup and some warm spices like black pepper. Not too much rye flavor on the finish - sort of a barely-legal rye vibe, with a hint of corn grain.\n\n**Final Note**: Solid pour. Nothing special - it's a little simple, generally average, but pleasant enough. We can see why it's a favorite for whisky-forward cocktails: that bottling strength does bring a kick and a warmth, and there's a nice spice flavor, but none of it is overwhelming.

It's coastal, with salt and seaweed, and we sometimes found a slight vegetal funkiness, like damp earth and green plants. Well-rounded, with some vanilla and balsamic later on, and a mild, dry, barbecued wood.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Intense, quite salty and peppery; the mouthfeel is medium or so, with medium-strong peat smoke coming through immediately. This is a little more dry than the nose, but we do get charred orange fruit, a hint of pear occasionally. Dry driftwood is paired with a slightly damp, musty oak note, and later, lemons and limes arrive along with barbecue flavors.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Warm and medium-long - that peat sticks around, along with sea spray and dry wood tannins. It's still a bit oily, and the citrusy acids cut through sweeter notes of vanilla and lemons candies. At the end, there's a lingering aftertaste of campfire wood smoke.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is a really solid entry in the realm of 'entry-level' Islay peat monsters. Strong smokiness, especially on the palate (the nose hides it a little bit in comparison), and a lot of classic, bright ex-bourbon Bruichladdich notes like dry wood and lemon. There is the occasional hint of richer cask influence, but this is nicely spirit-driven and balanced overall. Not exactly cheap at $70 to $75 or a little more, but still a pretty decent value in today's market for the flavor you're getting.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.1 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #136 - Highland Park 12 Year,49,16jf3qh,https://i.redd.it/8clbc5iikfob1.jpg,1694788563,,"[{'body': ""**Review #136 - Highland Park 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \nUp in the somewhat remote Orkney Islands, an archipelago located off the northern coast of Scotland, is the widely beloved Highland Park distillery. This is one of the oldest distilleries in Scotland, its roots dating back to 1798, and they have a defined style of light (but noticeable) peat, along with a decent number of releases employing sherry cask maturation. \r  \n\r  \nThis 12 Year bottling is the 'Viking Honor' edition, so it's been bottled after the rebrand in 2017. We still don't have the 46%+ strength that we would like, and like most of the volume bottles with these big brands, there's no mention of coloring or chill filtration. Actually, we could consider ourselves lucky here - being in the US, we get the 43% version of this whisky, while much of the rest of the world can only access it at a measly 40% ABV.\r  \n\r  \n**Highland Park 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 50 (2021)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 55 (2023) \r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 14 months; bottles at 80%, 70%, 50% (blind tasting), and 40% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Very soft smoke, with a mildly coastal character - salt, slightly briny, maybe a hint of seaweed at times. There are nice dark fruits here: plum especially stood out, but we get red apple and white grape as well, some red wine and pears, some candied fruit rinds. Baking spices are present, in the form of vanilla, cardamom and nutmeg, and there are sweet notes of caramel and freshly baked rolls; oak is mild, and slightly musty. Pleasant and interesting, if slightly soft, overall.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Balanced between sweet and dry: some tannins from the oak, but lots of sweeter fruits like candied apple, white grape, blood orange, and prune. The peat smoke is still light, but it causes light puckering in the cheeks; later, it gives way to a slightly savory barbecue note, accented by caramel, dried grass, and heather. There's a crust of sea salt on top, and it becomes just slightly bitter at the end. Medium-thin on the mouthfeel, but with the flavor variety, it almost feels a bit decadent.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, warm, and a buttery texture. The sherry cask notes of orange fruit and wood spice hang around, while the smoke is soft, only an accent flavor. There's just a hint of musty sulfur at times, but it's mostly masked by hay, vanilla, and candied apples.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Good whisky - well balanced and somewhat interesting despite the relatively low bottling strength. The mouthfeel does come across a little thinner than we would like, but the finish is long enough, and there are a variety of flavors packed into the different portions of the tasting experience. This could be a great introduction to peat for those who are hesitant - it just gives a light smoky flavor, nowhere near overwhelming like some of your Islay and other Highland malts. Value is quite good, too - it's $55 here, which is $10 to $15 cheaper than comparable (in our opinion) alternatives.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

I had originally started it right after I had finished a bottle of HP18, which I absolutely loved, and this didn't compare.\n\nNow, prices on pretty much everything highland park have doubled in my area so instead of $180 CAD for an HP18, it's $350 CAD so that's a bottle I'll never have again.\n\nSo, I gave the highland park 12 a redo (it's been half empty for a couple of years in the back of a cool cabinet) and I quite liked it! I was doing a comparison to a Glenmorangie 16. The HP12 won by a landslide, imho.  I agree with your notes. Given that it's $80 where I am, I'm not likely to buy it again as I find myself enjoying other things in that price range more than I would the HP12.  Most of them are bourbons, to be fair, but I'm glad I revisited the HP12. Fairly smooth, tasty and enjoyable.

Not only do you get a variety of flavor notes, from heather honey to light peat to sherry, but you get them sequentially, like a story.  \n\nI recently did a taste test of Macallan 12 vs. Glendronach 12, comparing entry level sherry bombs.  And I threw in HP 12 just because I had it handy.  They were all quite similar in terms of sherry notes.  But the Macallan lost out for being slightly spirity, the Glendronach was better as a bright sherried dram, but the HP 12 won for me.  It scratched the exact same sherry itch as the Glendronach, and they tasted very similar on the finish, but the HP 12 did a lot more as well, with more complexity and more of an unfolding experience.  \n\nYes, it's still an entry level 12 year, but it's one of the best entry levels and offers one of the best quality to price ratios.

Review #135 - GlenDronach 12 Year,29,16ijmsr,https://i.redd.it/hkhg0bm0c8ob1.jpg,1694700955,,"[{'body': ""**Review #135 - GlenDronach 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \nThis has to be one of the most hyped up distilleries that we've found through our online research (reading reviews, watching videos, looking for recommendations). Previously owned by Billy Walker's team, GlenDronach was revived and turn into a fan favorite with its balanced sherry cask maturation and improved bottling stats, such as higher strength, high age statements, and lack of additives/filtration.\r  \n\r  \nFor our introduction to the brand, we went to the entry-level 12 Year, one of the whiskies we see recommended most often here on Reddit when newer whisky enthusiasts are looking for next steps, especially in the sherried direction. This is presented at 43%, not quite as high a strength as we would prefer, but we're hoping the quality of the distillate and casks can make up for that.\r  \n\r  \n**GlenDronach 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 53 (2022)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 60 (2023) \r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: PX and Oloroso casks from Spain\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 5 months; bottles at 90%, 80% (blind tasting), 60% (blind tasting), and 50% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Pleasant and rounded, a little soft, with plenty of fruity wine notes: nuts and figs and cinnamon, sweet grape, brown sugar-like baking spices, cherries and strawberry. The longer the bottle was open, the more the nose transitioned to stewed fruits like prune, along with a bit more wood spice: pepper, dry oak, even just a whiff of wood smoke at the top of the glass. Sweet, reddish-purple fruits are really the star of the show.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Sort of cozy and warm for 43% ABV, with a medium-thin mouthfeel. Still a lot of fruit, in the realm of prune, blood orange, seedy raisins, figs, and freeze-dried strawberry; there's more spice now, with cinnamon, clove, cardamom, your typical 'Christmas spice' notes. Oak is pretty mild, and with more time, some chocolate and perfume creep out in the palate. In individual tastings, we found the occasional caramel, nutmeg, and molasses flavor.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, pleasant and gentle, with a soft texture and mild flavors. Not particularly oaky, not showing a lot of age, but there are stewed and dried fruits, a hint of malty chocolate, and some candied nuts. We finish with a gentle orange fruit note.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Fruit-forward, cask heavy... it's fine. The flavors are all in one vein, not leading to a lot of complexity, and the lower ABV does let this down on the mouthfeel and the length of the finish, but it's a pleasant sipper. Great for an entry level palate or a casual drink if you don't want to analyze, but if you're looking for something complex and interesting, you'll probably move on past this.

Review #134 - Filey Bay Flagship,9,16hp8wt,https://i.redd.it/osupompme1ob1.jpg,1694617089,,"[{'body': ""**Review #134 - Filey Bay Flagship**\r  \n\r  \nA few months ago, we had a chance to attend a tasting event led by one of the co-founders of the Spirit of Yorkshire distillery, David Thompson. We walked through a variety of the distillery's offerings: this entry level Flagship, a STR cask finish, a peated cask finish (their distillate is entirely unpeated), an Oloroso single cask, a Fino single cask, and the Yorkshire Day annual limited release. Their bright, crisp spirit style allows the casks involved to showcase their unique flavors very effectively.\r  \n\r  \nSpirit of Yorkshire actually started as a beer brewery on a farm, located in the Filey Bay area of Yorkshire, England. One interesting thing about the their single malt whisky is the way it's made - due to specific wording in the current iteration of the English single malt rules, copper pot still distillation can be combined with column still distillation, as long as it's all malted barley.\r  \n\r  \nThere's no age statement on the bottle, similar to many younger distilleries, but during our guided tasting, David mentioned that the average age of the whisky in these bottles is just under 7 years old, so it's far from the youngest new single malt. Maturation for this release is a majority of ex-bourbon casks, although those details aren't specifically disclosed, either. Another nugget from the tasting session - they use Old Forester bourbon barrels for their maturation.\r  \n\r  \n**Filey Bay Flagship**\r  \n\r  \n*England - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 74 (2023)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 70 (2023) \r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon casks from Old Forester\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 2 months; bottles at 30%, 40% (blind tasting), and 10% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Fresh and bright is the overall feeling - light tropical fruits of pineapple, melon, and guava, along with baking notes of biscuits, yeast, vanilla, and cinnamon. This has a nice spirit influence in it - cleaner and mildly sharp, and more fruits soon arrive: dried mango and tons of peach, which gradually changes to bubblegum. The oak is soft but dry, and we end with butterscotch.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium mouthfeel; it's warm and silky, strong and crisp. Sweeter notes of butterscotch, honey, and burnt sugar, but also nutmeg, cardamom, dry wood, and sharpness from lemon. The peach fruit comes back with a vengeance - it starts to take over, with notes like ripe peach, peach ring candies, and sugar. Slightly tropical at times, with creamy vanilla.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, with more of the sweet baking notes from the palate: brown sugar, cardamom, vanilla, and then peach schnapps. Drying oak and tart lemon balance out the sugary flavors, and clove and peppercorns back that up. At the end, lingering notes of oats and honey.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is nice - a good example of bright, ex-bourbon single malt at a relatively young age. Not the most complex, but the light, tropical fruits were a delight, and it's probably the strongest peach note we've ever gotten in a whisky. Not the cheapest, but this seems to be in the ballpark with a lot of other standard releases from new age single malt distilleries.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 6.5 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #133 - Royal Brackla 12 Year,41,16fx3va,https://i.redd.it/0qz6dmx32nnb1.jpg,1694443424,,"[{'body': ""**Review #133 - Royal Brackla 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \nA relatively new distillery for us - established in 1812, and given a royal warrant in 1833, so by no means 'new' in the scheme of distilleries. We only tried products from this brand in the last couple of months, though, including this 12 year, as well as a couple of Signatory bottlings. Today we're looking at the distillery's entry level whisky.\r  \n\r  \nOwned by Bacardi via Dewar's, this whisky has an Oloroso sherry cask finish, which presumably means it spent some earlier time in ex-bourbon barrels for initial maturation. It's presented at a solid 46% ABV, and we don't have any added color or chill filtration, which is an added bonus.\r  \n\r  \nWe don't generally place much stock in the appearance of a bottle and its label, but we do like the look of this one a lot. It's a tall bottle, which can be problematic for storage purposes, but this has a premium feel to it, and the label is quite understated, classic, and classy. The natural color of the whisky is a lovely darker tone, implying some potential first-fill sherry maturation; if appearance is anything to go by, we might be in for something nice. We'll let the liquid do the talking, though.\r  \n\r  \n**Royal Brackla 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 63 (2023)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 63 (2023) \r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Oloroso cask finish\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 1 month; bottles at 100%, 90%, and 80% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: A bit of ginger, then lots of fruits: stewed fruit like plum, tart fruit like cranberries, and plenty of citrus like orange and lemon. There is more sweetness from brown sugar and cardamom, along with a freshness from some spirit influence and malt. This is clean and bright, and with more air time, the oak slowly comes to the front.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A medium mouthfeel, maybe a little more; peppery and a bit more spicy than your average unpeated sherried single malt. It's white pepper and cinnamon, wood spice, some cardamom and clove. There are still fruits like orange and cranberry, maybe a hint of light fruit like apricot on the back end; it's balanced between sweet and sour, with brown sugar balanced by oak. Later, hints of metallic character, like copper, and it's slightly estery.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, with soft, oily oak and some sweeter fruits of orange and raspberry. Black pepper and drying oak come and go, and there's an aftertaste of bell peppers.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Enjoying this one - the spicier, more peppery kick on the palate is a nice added dimension when compared to some other entry level, unpeated, sherried whiskies. There's a nice selection of fruits on the nose and palate if you give it some time to air out, as well; still, it's not the most complex whisky, and the standard bottling strength doesn't allow it to convey more at its relatively young age. Price seems about par for the course when we come to Speyside and Highland 12 year whiskies - for that reason, this gets a roughly average value rating.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 6.3 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

From the Midleton distillery, this is a step up from the entry level Redbreast 12 Year in multiple ways: it gets an additional three years of maturation, and it's bottled at a strength of 46% ABV, up from 40% on the 12 Year. That does come at a price, though - while this can be found under $100 in some places, it costs more like $115 in our area.\r  \n\r  \n**Redbreast 15 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Ireland - Single Pot Still*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 115 (2023) \r  \n**Age Statement**: 15 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 2 months; bottles at 50% and 100% fill levels at times of review.

Pleasant, slightly floral at times.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Warm and cozy, with plenty of oils; a medium-thick mouthfeel. Fruits are red but also nectarine stone fruit, introducing a slightly dry side. Spiced cider and mulled wine notes add to the cozy feeling, and there's a hint of cream as well; the oak is still somewhat strong, and it's balanced.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, with pleasant warmth a some oils hanging around the mouth. That oak influence is still here, but much more mild on the finish - yellow and orange citrus notes come in, along with nutmeg and pepper spice. Becomes a bit more delicate, but a nice finish.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is good - starting to get some complexity, definitely more than the 12 Year offering, but it's still a bit subtle.

Now, we have the Edited single malt, a lighted peated Indian whisky from Goa. It's aged in an undisclosed variety of casks, and comes in at a pleasant 46% ABV.\r  \n\r  \nOne interesting point from the brand is on its website - they actually give a recommended food pairing for this whisky. Due to its flavors of 'peat and chocolate mint,' they recommend sipping this alongside a mildly spiced lamb stew or dark chocolate.\r  \n\r  \n**Paul John Edited**\r  \n\r  \n*India - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 46 (2023) \r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 6 months; bottles at 80% and 30% fill levels at times of review.

There's some cut grass and almost a dirt note to start, a decent amount of minerality, and then we move into spices: pepper and nutmeg come to mind. It's a bit green and mossy, more vegetal with time to open up, and not too sweet - slightly dry wood and herbs. Later, some petrichor and sweet perfume come to the front, along with a hint of... ammonia?\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium mouthfeel, nice oily oak and mellow warmth. Lots of baking notes now in the palate: clove and mild nutmeg, some banana and butter, a hint of sherry wine, some white pepper and paprika. A pleasant shift from spicy to sweet, with barbecue on the back end, and a medium peat smoke influence. Not nearly as vegetal and herbal as the nose, very different.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, maybe medium-long with that peat smoke still sticking around. Red fruits and a black pepper kick near the beginning, but sweet green apple peels and overripe banana on the back end. Lingering notes of buttercream and clove, with an aftertaste of spice.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This one is quite interesting - the nose may put some people off with its unusual character, but there's a lot to explore. The palate becomes a bit more mainstream, but still delivers decent complexity, changing a bit from tasting to tasting. Hard to say what the undisclosed casks are - we get hints of sherry or red wine in there, but there's plenty of baking spices, suggesting some ex-bourbon or refill barrels as well.

Review #129 - The Sovereign Invergordon 50 Year (1964),30,169tshz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/169tshz,1693838478,,"[{'body': ""**Review #129 - The Sovereign Invergordon 50 Year (1964)**\r  \n\r  \n*'Old' Whisky Series: Part 4 of 4*\n\nTo those of you who celebrate - happy Labor Day!\r  \n\r  \nWhat better way to wrap this series than a ridiculously old whisky? This is the oldest spirit we've tasted, by a decent margin. Aged for 50 years before bottling in 2014, this Invergordon single grain comes from a single cask. It has a distillation vintage of November 1964, and was aged in an ex-bourbon cask, which somehow still yielded 252 bottles after those 50 years... perhaps multiple previous casks were combined and recasked into this one?\r  \n\r  \nOwned by Hunter Laing, The Sovereign brand is used for bottlings of single grain Scotch whiskies, specifically single casks. They are generally bottled at more mature ages, from 25 to 50 years, as grain whisky ages quite well compared to single malts, which becomes more easily over-oaked. Grain whisky is also much cheaper to produce and purchase than single malts, so these very old single grain bottlings can be found at a fraction of the price of malts the same age.\r  \n\r  \nInvergordon is a huge grain distillery in the Highlands of Scotland - its estimated production capacity is 40 million liters of pure alcohol per annum, double the size of the largest single malt distillery in the country. It's actually a relatively new distillery, founded in 1960, and as you'd expect, the vast majority of its production becomes the grain component of large blended whisky brands.\r  \n\r  \n**The Sovereign Invergordon 50 Year (1964)**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland - Single Grain*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 558 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 50 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 42.5% ABV\r  \n**Details**: Distilled November 1964, bottled November 2014, ex-bourbon cask HL 11047, 252 bottles\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle 40% fill level at time of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Rich oak and brown sugar; it's still slightly grainy, and it takes some air time to open up. With time, there's more herbal spice, along with licorice and wood sugars. The oak takes the form of old polished mahogany, and that polish note continues to grow stronger.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Rich again on the palate, with a medium mouthfeel - the lower bottling strength is being offset by all of the woody oils from so much time in the cask. Very oaky with wood sugars and spice, brown sugar, and then baking spices: nutmeg, maybe clove. A hint of spirit influence, and as it opens up, it becomes sweeter.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long; sweet oak and toast, more brown sugar, and soft vanilla. There's a hint of grainy character again, sweetness like simple syrup, and then a mild nutmeg to end.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Good whisky, and actually one that's hard for us to judge. This combines two categories we aren't too experienced with: single grains and very old whiskies.  The flavors are rich but a little simple - past the oaky baking spices and grain, there isn't really another dimension like fruit, savory, or mineral. Still, a very enjoyable experience, and one we're glad we had a chance to try. As you might expect, though - the price makes a bottle purchase pretty difficult to justify, unless you're in the habit of buying a lot of old whisky already.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #128 - Bruichladdich Black Art 09.1 29 Year,91,1678t2z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1678t2z,1693578791,,"[{'body': ""**Review #128 - Bruichladdich Black Art 09.1 29 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*'Old' Whisky Series: Part 3 of 4*\r  \n\r  \nWe were lucky to be introduced to Bruichladdich early on in our whisky journey - it quickly became one of our favorite distilleries, and it remains that way today. While we first fell in love with the flavor (which we still love), we now appreciate the distillery even more for its quality presentation \\[50%+ ABV, no added color or chill filtration\\], intrinsic quality, and transparency.\r  \n\r  \nIt was a tasting event at a local whisky-centric bar where we got to know these whiskies - a brand representative from Remy Cointreau, who represented Bruichladdich specifically, gave a presentation on the distillery's whiskies, alongside a viewing of 'The Water of Life: A Whisky Film.' This is a documentary about the Scotch whisky industry, with a focus on Bruichladdich - it's worth a watch.\r  \n\r  \nWe tasted the core Bruichladdich range, one from each of their brands: Bruichladdich's unpeated Classic Laddie, the heavily peated Port Charlotte 10 Year, and one of the Octomore bottlings available at that time (we didn't record which one). As a treat at the end of the tasting, we were each given a conservative pour of Jim McEwan's swan song at Bruichladdich, the Black Art 04.1. These Black Art bottlings are annual special releases, with varying cask recipes and ages - the 04.1 was aged 23 years, for instance, or at least the youngest whisky in the bottle was that old.\r  \n\r  \nAfter just a couple of sips, we knew that we had to get our hands on a Black Art bottle someday, if the chance arose - they were prohibitively expensive, but this was special.\r  \n\r  \nFast forward a couple of years, and we found a bottle from the European market that could be shipped to us in the USA - after some debate between us, we decided to pull the trigger for something special, this one time. It wasn't the 23 year old 04.1 that we had previously tasted, but instead, the 09.1 edition of Black Art, a 29 year old whisky.\r  \n\r  \nWith a distillation vintage of 1992, this is an unpeated Bruichladdich aged in an unknown assortment of casks. Based on the taste, it has almost certainly spent time in some wine or sherry barrels, but we're not nearly capable of picking out any specifics. As far as we know, the information about this bottle will remain a mystery.\r  \n\r  \nBottled at a cask strength of 44.1% ABV, this is not chill filtered and has no added coloring. We'll do our best to keep the tasting notes manageable, but this is a very complex whisky - it gave us new flavors each time we tasted it.\r  \n\r  \n**Bruichladdich Black Art 09.1 29 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 430 (2021)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 655 (2023) \r  \n**Age Statement**: 29 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 44.1% ABV\r  \n**Details**: No color added, not chill filtered, 1992 vintage\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 5 times over 17 months; bottles at 100%, 80%, 60%, 50% (blind tasting), and 40% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes (or more)\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: A plethora of fruits - we could write a whole paragraph just about those. Tropical fruits like melon, pineapple, mango, and cantaloupe; darker fruits like raisin and prune, some seedy figs, even dark berries; later on, some cherry and licorice come through, too. This whisky does show its age, with old oak wood and polished leather shoes, some tobacco... quite mature, almost bordering on over-oaked in one tasting. We get some sweeter baking notes like cream and brown sugar, but also cream soda and vanilla - it's bright, despite its age, and once in a while a hint of spirit character sneaks through. A few feinty notes here and there: mulch and seaweed, a slight salinity.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium-thick mouthfeel despite the ABV, it's oily but soft all the time, very rich. Plenty of ex-wine cask influence in the form of more fruits: raisin, melon, pear, fig, sour prune, pineapple fizz, and guava - maybe some sweeter white wine cask aging? It's somewhat light and tropical overall, but those dark, mature notes come back: lots of leather and old oak, polish, unsmoked tobacco leaf, maple sugar. This is probably the oakiest Scotch we've tried without it being over-oaked. Hints of blackberry and plum waft through, along with black pepper and cinnamon, which add a mild spice kick. With more air time, sweetness from malty butterscotch and floral perfume arrive.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, but still soft and velvety. Subtle fruits now of raisin and plum, more into the dark side of fruit - those tropical notes from the palate have faded. Lots of oak now, a hint of bitterness as some astringent tannins poke through, which warms the cheeks; some malty grain and brown sugar are here, butterscotch too, and the strong oak continues to linger. Lots of polish notes, almost bordering on chemical, and we end with an aftertaste of buttered pancakes and sparkly cream soda.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: If there's one thing we've learned from this, it's that an old whisky with exotic cask maturation can offer a different experience every time you taste it - there are new flavors all the time. In addition to subtle differences in each tasting, the overall complexion also changed over time: when freshly opened, the bottle was full of fresh fruits of all colors; now, after a year and a half of oxidation, there is a much heavier emphasis on old, polished oak notes and perfume.\r  \n\r  \nFor overall perspective - this is very good. Lovely stuff, really, and especially with the nose, we could sit for a long time to admire the different flavors. Is it the best whisky we've tasted? No, and it definitely isn't perfect, but it's up there. This is a lot of money to spend on a bottle of whisky, but given the option to go back with our current knowledge and make the decision again... we would buy it again.

Review #127 - Laphroaig 30 Year,132,166cy5b,https://i.redd.it/7yfmyfjbjglb1.jpg,1693492724,,"[{'body': ""It's funny, I've read so many high age Laphroaig reviews and it definitely seems not worth it, but I still want it. 😂"", 'score': 35}, {'body': ""**Review #127 - Laphroaig 30 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*'Old' Whisky Series: Part 2 of 4*\r  \n\r  \nThis tasting was a milestone birthday treat, and it came at no small expense - this is very hard to find, especially in our area. It's Laphroaig 30 Year, a distillery bottling, coming in at 43% ABV. We were able to try it at a local whisky bar, where it had been sitting for a couple of years, rather untouched.\r  \n\r  \nThe smokiness or peat in a whisky will generally decline with more time spent aging in a cask. Because of this, we're expecting this Laphroaig to be much less smoky when compared to more available versions like the 10 year or Quarter Cask. How much peat will there still be? That's what we're most curious about.\r  \n\r  \n**Laphroaig 30 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 1,100 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 30 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle 80% fill level at time of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Tar and rubber to start, and it's slightly metallic, a bit like copper. The smoke is mellow, but the experience is rich overall, with a strong old oak influence, like polished furniture wood. There is a mild savory barbecue note, some charred orange rind, and just a hint of dark red fruit like a raspberry preserve. With more time, the rubbery note grows stronger; there's creosote, as well as more grilled fruit.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium and the smoke is mild, maybe pushing toward a medium influence. Rich and mellow wood smoke, more rubber, and some barbecue return; there are charred berries and orange rind as well, with sweeter orange slices and sherbet undertones later. We get old leather and polished oak, and it ends with some soot.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, with a cooling feeling and a tickle of tannins around the gums. The mellow peat smoke lingers but does fall away, leaving more rubber and wood smoke. In the background, there are subtle fruits like sugary orange.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: An interesting one, and probably the most rubbery Laphroaig we've tasted, despite the reduction in the peat influence. There are those nice old oak flavors you expect with a whisky this old, and the sherbety and citrusy fruits add a nice dimension. This definitely is not a flavor bomb - it's very subtle, quite restrained, so it's not going to punch you in the face like a lot of single malts from this distillery. If you take your time with it, though, there is a lot to enjoy. No comments for value, really - nothing at this sort of price point is a good value.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 8.5 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\r  \n\r  \n**Value Rating**: 3.13\r  \n\r  \n**About Us**: We're a husband and wife review team living in the Midwest United States.

When you compare Laphroaig 25, for example, to Ardbeg 25, you get a higher proof offering for at least $400 less. It\'s priced in the same neighborhood as Longrow 21 and Springbank 21, which are younger and lower proof. \n\nI think for most people, depending on wealth, there\'s a price point beyond which no whiskey is worth the price.

Review #126 - Craigellachie 23 Year,24,165gnse,https://i.redd.it/gykolah8f9lb1.jpg,1693406603,,"[{'body': ""**Review #126 - Craigellachie 23 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*'Old' Whisky Series: Part 1 of 4*\r  \n\r  \nHere's a quick series on 'older' whiskies, which we're defining as 20+ years in the cask, at least for the purposes of these reviews. We really haven't tried too many older whiskies like this - we got into the hobby a little too late to get our hands on them without paying gigantic prices. Still, we have had a chance to try a few, and we're lucky enough to have a couple of the bottles ourselves.\r  \n\r  \nThe first we're looking at is Craigellachie 23, a Speyside single malt, made in a self-proclaimed 'old-school' and 'sulfury' style. They use worm tubs in the condensation of their spirits, so we're hoping for a weighty, slightly meaty whisky experience; the distillery is also known specifically for their sherry cask maturation.\r  \n\r  \nThis 23 Year bottling has the preferable strength of 46% ABV, and has the benefit of being un-colored and not chill filtered. The combination of higher age and good stats does come at a price, though - this is $330 in our market.\r  \n\r  \nAn interesting note - in the marketing gibberish on the back of the bottle, the brand claims that their old school methodology 'creates a gutsy dram that rivals whiskies twice its age.' Yes, that is a direct quote. So, will this sip more like a 46 year old whisky? In that case, $330 might not be so bad. Ha.\r  \n\r  \n**Craigellachie 23 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 330 (2023) \r  \n**Age Statement**: 23 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: First fill ex-bourbon and first fill ex-sherry casks\r  \n**Details**: No color added, not chill filtered, Batch 67KA23\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 14 months; bottles at 100%, 90%, 80%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Perfume and old, rich, polished oak come to the front right away. You can smell the age on it, and it brings leather and the dried leaves of autumn, a dry wood campfire, which is mildly smoky. Cigars and nutty oak, balanced, and then the baking notes come in: vanilla, orange fruit, cranberry-orange bread, nutmeg. With more air time, we're finding damp tree bark, spearmint, and some tropical fruits: pineapple, creamy guava, and some plums. Really nice nose.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium mouthfeel, almost medium-thin; this is more tart and sulfury than the nose, with oak oils, grapefruit, orange, and plenty of baking spices. The age does still show through: polished leather, old wood, a light tannin influence, and some sweet perfume are all here. Light honey syrup, cinnamon, and nuts linger in the background; it's quite complex, and takes time to dig into. There are fruits later, more spiced orange, and then brown sugar.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, with oily oak, lots of nuts like toasted almonds, resin, and some slightly savory flavors. Mild bitter sulfur and maltiness come and go, tart apple and dried grass add a lighter dimension, and shoe polish and tobacco smoke add complexity. There is sweetness from vanilla once more, along with golden raisins and a soft red wine richness.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This one definitely benefits from more air time; leaving it in the glass for 30+ minutes allows it to open up and reveal more of its complexity. The nose especially is lovely, and while the palate is nice as well, it can't live up to the smells we were tempted with. The mouthfeel is on the thin side of medium, and the flavors in the palate are much more subtle - you need to go searching in it for a while for the details. Still, a very good whisky overall - we would happily recommend this on flavor alone. The issue is the price... over $300? I'm not sure about that, but as you get into older whiskies, value does seem to disappear across the board, and this isn't the worst offender.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 8.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #125 - Old 55 100% Sweet Corn Bourbon,14,163ochh,https://i.redd.it/fasxtthw7vkb1.jpg,1693234640,,"[{'body': ""**Review #125 - Old 55 100% Sweet Corn Bourbon**\n\nFrom a small, rural distillery in Newtown, Indiana, we have a 100% Sweet Corn Bourbon - this is from Old 55 Distillery. Established in 2013, this family-owned distillery is built around the family's farm, based in the remains of an old schoolhouse near their property.\n\nThe unique mashbill is really the point of interest here: this is made entirely from low-yield sweet corn grain. No typical corn varieties, no rye or wheat, and no malted barley. In order to get mashing and fermentation working correct, enzymes are added synthetically to the mash, as opposed to the traditional malted barley method. Because of the use of this grain, the cost of these bottles is quite high - it's not an efficient method for creating bourbon.\n\nThis bourbon is also bottled-in-bond, so it's aged at least four years, and bottled at 50%. In fact, most of the whiskies bottled by Old 55 are single barrel products, and we get some good information on the back label: this bottle is from Batch 18A10, which was distilled and barreled during the Spring of 2018, and bottled in the Spring of 2022.\n\n**Old 55 100% Sweet Corn Bourbon**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 170 (2023) \n\n**Age Statement**: 4 Years\n\n**Strength**: 50% ABV\n\n**Details**: Mashbill of 100% sweet corn; bottled in bond; Batch 18A10, barreled Spring 2018, bottled Spring 2022\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 2 months; bottles at 80% and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Light and pale in complexion, sharp, and a pretty strong acetone or sharpie marker smell at the beginning. We get wheat and hay, and it's slightly sweet, with just a bit of grain. Mild vanilla, white pepper, and some canned corn come in; it can be a bit metallic, and there's a chemical eucalyptus note, almost like a young rye. That permanent marker note ends up permeating pretty much the entire experience, start to finish.\n\n**Palate**: Acetone and oak, it's young and a bit raw. There is a sugary sweetness hiding behind that, with cake icing, vanilla bean, maybe a bit of spicy pepper to go along with it. It's warm, and the oak seems young, adding more maple sugar and burnt cinnamon toast. There's a sort of craft, almost homemade, feel to it, and the mouthfeel is medium-thick; again, that chemical permanent marker note keeps on appearing.\n\n**Finish**: Vanilla ice cream, some heat from both ABV and spicy oak, some white pepper, too. More permanent marker, some wet oak later, and a bit of canned corn. There's a sharp aftertaste, young and raw.\n\n**Final Note**: Well, the concept is certainly unique. The sweet corn does definitely add another dimension of grain flavor - you can almost taste a sweet, canned corn sort of note in there. Beyond that, though, there are some flaws: the maturation doesn't seem to have tamed this nearly enough, there are a lot of similarities to a new-make spirit. It's sharp and harsh, and that chemical permanent marker smell and taste never disappears. It could be that this specific single barrel had issues, but we're not sure. And, because of the combination of flawed liquid and high price, value... isn't great.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 2.5 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

This ranges from the BTAC released each year, which is extremely allocated and can fetch thousands per bottle on the secondary market, down to products like Eagle Rare, a $30, 10 year age-stated bourbon. In some places, it's even gone down to their entry level product - Buffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey.\n\nThis is a $25 bourbon bottled at 45% ABV (90 Proof) with no stated age... or really much other information of any sort. Research online will reveal that this product is made using BT's mashbill #1, a low-rye recipe, so we might be looking for a sweeter sipper today.\n\n**Buffalo Trace Bourbon**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 30 (2021)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 25 (2023) \n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 45% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 8 months; bottles at 80% and 60% fill levels at times of review.

With more time, that cherry note turns almost medicinal; there's leathery wood smoke and a whiff of barbecue at times, with just the faintest alcohol note.\n\n**Palate**: Balanced between sweet and dry, maybe leaning a little sweet; it's sweet and sour cherries, a nice mild kick, leather and cough syrup, some molasses, too. The mouthfeel is medium, and there's some light oak in here, still not too dry, with mild baking spices. On subsequent sips, a little bit of dusty grain character peaks through.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length with a slight acidity but lots of sweetness - cherry again, orange rind, it's rounded and soft. Somewhat mellow overall, but we do find a tickle of anise spice on the back end.\n\n**Final Note**: A pretty good sipper - above average, surely, and well above average for its price point, making this a good value pick if you can find it around $25 to $30. There's nothing really exceptional here, but it's quite solid, and we recommend it - both for a casual neat sip, but also to make a nice, sweet cocktail.

Plenty of pepper and black licorice, some cardamom, turning into buttery brown sugar.\n\n**Final Note**: This is okay - lots of young, menthol rye notes.

Between skiing Mary Jane and hunting up in that area I’m around Fraser quite a bit but haven’t ever stopped here, I’ll have to give them a try soon. For favorite CO whiskey I’ll have to go with the Leopold Bros.  Three Chamber Rye. Not worth $250 but absolutely worth the $15 for a pour at their tasting room!', 'score': 6}, {'body': ""**Review #122 - Fraser Valley Colorado Bourbon**\n\nOn a trip to the Rockies a couple of years ago, we stopped at Fraser Valley Distilling in Fraser, Colorado. This is a small, local distillery producing a range of products - whiskies (including bourbon, rye, single malt, and more), gins, agave, vodka, and more.\n\nAfter tasting a flight of spirits at the distillery's cozy tasting room, we decided to snag a bottle of this Colorado bourbon whiskey - it stood out from the others. This was earlier on our whisky journey, and we couldn't quite pick out what the unique factor was, but our interest was piqued.\n\nWhile the distillery currently makes a straight bourbon, this is actually a different product, a more limited bottling from earlier in their distilling journey. This is the 'Colorado Bourbon,' a whisky with a mashbill high in malted barley content - the difference that stuck out in our tasting at the distillery.\n\nLike many young, craft distilleries, the whisky produced is often bottled at a relatively young age; in fact, this one doesn't boast an obvious age statement, but in the print on the back label, you can find a guarantee of one year of aging.\n\n**Fraser Valley Colorado Bourbon**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 38 (2021)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: N/A - no longer available (2023) \n\n**Age Statement**: 1 Year\n\n**Strength**: 43% ABV\n\n**Details**: High barley mashbill\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 11 months; bottles at 90%, 80%, and 70% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: A decent amount of grain, both corn and malt - this almost smells like a single malt at times due to that high malted barley content. Young but still oaky, lots of oats and cereal, along with some white pepper; it's relatively dry, not too many sweet flavors other than barley sugar. Some cinnamon comes in, and in one tasting, hints of stone fruit wafted in.\n\n**Palate**: Medium-thin mouthfeel, lively and spirity, and that one year age statement is shining through - young with sugary oatmeal grains, some heat and not too much oak. There's a hint of maraschino cherries, but lots of spices take over - anise, black pepper, wood smoke, a slight astringency, too.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length, warming with hot cinnamon and some wood astringency. A hint of acetone, and there's some corn grain once again.\n\n**Final Note**: The big drawback here is the age - while some whiskies can be good after a relatively short time spent maturing, this one needs a little more time. The more current bourbon offering from FVD sport a 'straight' bourbon designation with no age statement, meaning it should be at least 4 years old; that might be worth a look soon, so we can compare. As for value - not necessarily relevant in this case, as this bottling is no longer available.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 4.8 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Complementing the fruits are baking spices of vanilla and cinnamon, almost like a baked donut. Occasionally, it was slightly tart with a tiny hint of wood smoke; with more time, the nose opened to rich plum.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A bit more dried fruit on the palate - raisin and plum, some cherries, but also sweet green apple and grape. The cinnamon returns from the nose, and there's just a bit of oak in here, but it's somewhat mild overall, rounded and soft. The mouthfeel is medium-thin, and after tasting some other higher proof spirits, this does come across as slightly watery in comparison.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is short, providing soft apple and maple sugar, along with savory pears and plenty of vanilla.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is fine, if a little plain. There are pleasant flavors of orchard fruit and baking spices, but it's pretty simple and mild in the end. The 40% bottling strength really doesn't do it any favors, but because of its mild complexion and lower strength, it's a great entry point to sherried single malt whisky.

Review #120 - GlenAllachie 12 Year,39,15um79h,https://i.redd.it/d9j651udqvib1.jpg,1692369158,,"[{'body': ""**Review #120 - GlenAllachie 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*12 Year Speysider Series: Part 6 of 7*\r  \n\r  \nPart 6 of our series is heading to GlenAllachie, Billy Walker's latest project. Located near Aberlour in the Speyside region of Scotland, this distillery was taken over by Billy and his team in 2017, when they purchased it from Chivas Brothers. This actually isn't a particularly old distillery in the first place - opened in 1967, it certainly isn't 'new,' but much newer than the stalwarts of Scotch whisky that opened in the late 1700s and early 1800s.\r  \n\r  \nThe distillate in these 12 year bottles predates Billy Walker's time at the distillery, so we'll still be looking at the old character of the spirit. That said, the master blender is known for his heavy cask play and dominant wine finished whiskies, so we might not be seeing a whole lot of that distillate character, anyways. This whisky is supposedly aged in a combination of ex-Oloroso, ex-Pedro Ximenez, and virgin oak casks, and possibly some ex-bourbon casks, although the information isn't officially stated anywhere, as far as we could tell. If color is anything to go by - natural color, in this case - this is going to be a very cask-dominated affair.\r  \n\r  \n**GlenAllachie 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 67 (2022)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 73 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 6 times over 9 months; bottles at 80%, 70%, 60% (blind tasting), 60% (blind tasting), 50%, and 40% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Rich, sweet, and very cask driven - dark cherries covered in chocolate, grape jelly, spiced candy and cinnamon, raspberries and strawberry. Lots of darker notes continue to come forward: molasses, prunes, figs, and some 'Christmas spice.' There's leather and more dark chocolate, cocoa powder and some sweet orange, as well... wow. Very rich and luxurious. Dark roast coffee beans, syrup, and just a mild dark oak finish us off.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium mouthfeel, syrupy with those dark fruits, chocolates, and baking notes. A hint of wood char before we get into fudge, molasses, candied nuts, and sweet raspberries; it's pomegranate seeds, cinnamon, sharp orange citrus, and clove. There is just a hint of a lighter flavor like vanilla or dry oak, but this is mostly in those dark sweet flavors. Pretty oily now, with plum and blackberries, even some of that 'fake' chocolate syrup.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length with sweet chocolate and a light tobacco; it's semi-sweet overall now, pretty cohesive and syrupy. There's slightly bitter cacao and a hint of sparkly pomegranate kick, but also dark brown sugar, buttery oil, molasses, and some cloyingly sweet maple syrup.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Rich and luxurious for a 12 year old whisky - this is good stuff. It's definitely leaning heavily into those casks, so if that's your style, you might like this even more; if you enjoy spirit-driven whiskies, it might not be up your alley.

Review #119 - Glenfiddich 12 Year,39,15tpngt,https://i.redd.it/o003akotnoib1.jpg,1692283557,,"[{'body': ""**Review #119 - Glenfiddich 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*12 Year Speysider Series: Part 5 of 7*\r  \n\r  \nThe best-selling single malt Scotch whisky in the world, at least as far as we can find - both the bottle specifically (the 12 Year), as well as the brand in general (Glenfiddich). This was one we couldn't avoid putting in the series - it's everywhere, and we pretty much always have a bottle hanging around our shelf.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the reasons this one is so popular is its entry level stats: on top of the 40% ABV strength, it's also one of the more budget friendly single malt options - we've seen it in the $42 to $48 range in the last year. It's almost definitely chill filtered and artificially colored, and the casks aren't too fancy - ex-bourbon is the predominant flavor, so we're looking for baking spice and lighter fruits.\r  \n\r  \n**Glenfiddich 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 42 (2022)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 50 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 40% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 5 months; bottles at 40%, 10%, 80% (blind tasting), and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Orchard fruits aplenty - pears, ripe green apple, red apples, golden apples, canned peaches as well. There's sweetness from vanilla and cinnamon, and we get quite a strong malty note at times; it's buttery and gives us wildflower honey, too. There's a soft side of creamy melon and perfume, before mild oak and nutmeg finish the nosing experience.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Light and crisp, with a thin mouthfeel - slightly watery. That said, it does give us plenty of light fruit flavors, similar to the nose - sweet apples, pears, savory orange, almost an apple pie at times. There's powdered sugar and vanilla backing up the baking side, along with nutmeg, brown sugar, and cardamom. There's mild dry oak, but it's more muted than the nose overall.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-short with buttery malt, drier oak, and some dry vanilla bean pods. It's a little less sweet now, with some wood sugars and dry cinnamon as well, but there are still some nice apple juice, pear, and clove notes.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is a classic entry level Speyside whisky - there's a reason it might be the best selling single malt bottle in the world. Classic (if slightly boring, sometimes) ex-bourbon cask flavors and no smoke, so it's approachable and easy on the palate. The 40% ABV does make this easier to try when you're new to spirits, but later in your journey, it might become a bit weak; we're at that point, although we can appreciate it for what it is. The whisky is fine, and the price is usually pretty good... although it has crept up in our area in the last year.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 5.7 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\r  \n\r  \n**Value Rating**: 6.43\r  \n\r  \n**About Us**: We're a husband and wife review team living in the Midwest United States.

Review #118 - Tamdhu 12 Year,17,15srkn3,https://i.redd.it/xrts204rghib1.jpg,1692196420,,"[{'body': ""**Review #118 - Tamdhu 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*12 Year Speysider Series: Part 4 of 7*\r  \n\r  \nAnother sherried Speyside whisky, and a distillery that's known specifically for that style - Tamdhu, and their 12 year entry. This is actually another exclusively sherry matured whisky as well, as opposed to the common double cask or finished whisky - it's proudly emblazoned on the top of the label in shining foil text.\r  \n\r  \nLike the Macallan we looked at recently, this is another brand that is clearly leaning heavily into their style to justify premium reputation, and the resulting premium pricing. Actually, this isn't terribly expensive (yet) - we bought it last year for $66, which isn't cheap, but maybe middle of the road for a 12 year old Scotch in today's market. How will it measure up against those other competitors that are in a similar price bracket?\r  \n\r  \n**Tamdhu 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 66 (2022)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 67 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Sherry casks\r  \n**Details**: No color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 3 months; bottles at 100%, 70%, 70% (blind tasting), and 50% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: A little bit reserved, with a darker cask complexion but also some sharp, musty spirit influence. The sherry aging shows up as orange, dry fig, and plums; there are some blanched nuts and nutmeg, as well as cinnamon, pointing in the direction of some possible European oak casks. We find a lighter side of vanilla, lemon, and orange wine at times, but it's soon back to dark chocolate, pecans, and woody red wine. Despite all of the flavors, this remains subtle, never too strong when wafting out of the glass.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium-thin body - the dilution is noticeable, though there are still plenty of intricately layered flavors to dig through. It starts with caramel and grapes, but we're soon into dried fig, cinnamon, spiced oak, and 'Christmas spice' - the hallmarks of the sherry aging. It's sweeter now, too, with brown sugar and cherries, some tinned fruit like pineapple, but that's balanced by more pepper and bitter orange rind. Near the end, we get dark roast coffee and milk chocolate.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, soft and silky, but a little thin. Mildly cozy with soft oak and dark fruits of plum and prune, along with a hint of clove and pepper. There are chocolate covered strawberries and some candied orange slices, along with a sharp lemon.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Again, the cardinal sin in these entry level Speyside whiskies seems to be low strength and heavy filtration - the mouthfeel just isn't there, and while there are some pleasant flavors to dig into, it struggles to deliver any sort of punch. Good if you're looking for a casual, easy sip, but we're looking for a little more than that in our reviews. The other item we can't pass on mentioning is the packaging... a little over the top, in this case. Yeah, the tall, art deco bottle looks nice and sparkles in the light, and the big semi-open box it arrived in looks 'cool,' but in this case, we would rather have no box and a simpler bottle if it could take $10 off the price.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 6.3 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

It's a series designed to celebrate the founder of the distillery, George Smith, and the way he crafted the distillate in the early 1800s, before the distillery was licensed.\r  \n\r  \nThe difference between this Illicit Still bottling and the standard Glenlivet 12 is a great improvement: we go from 40% ABV up to 48%, and it's no longer chill filtered, two changes that mean we should get a lot more of the natural flavor delivered from the liquid. The standard 12 year is pleasant, not going to offend many drinkers with its flavors, but it can be a little bland once you're out of the beginning stages of a whisky journey; we're hoping this one is a bit more interesting.\r  \n\r  \n**Glenlivet 12 Year Illicit Still**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 62 (2022)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 62 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 48% ABV\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 10 months; bottles at 90%, 70%, 60% (blind tasting), and 30% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Mellow and sweet, with lots of fruits... an orchard fruit bomb, really. Sweet green apples, juicy Asian pear, red plums, even strawberries come to mind, and there's a hint of stewed fruits in there, too. Plenty of creamy vanilla and honey when it comes to baking notes, along with Hawaiian rolls and some cinnamon; there's oak here, but it's mild and not too dry. With more air time, the nose turns toward beeswax and perfume, even a bit of elderflower.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium, and it brings more sweet notes: vanilla and bubblegum, glazed strawberries and thick wildflower honey. This is noticeably more oily than the standard Glenlivet 12, and we're getting more brown sugars and caramel, along with more orchard fruits: overripe pear, red and green apples, and there's some cinnamon and clove mixed in with the other baking spices. Occasionally a whiff of wood smoke appears but it's quite soft, and it gets mixed in with more sweet perfume. We end the palate with soft yet warming pepper, some candied purple fruits, oatmeal, and a hint of mineral water.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, with a little bit of prickly oak and spice that helps build some lingering warmth around the palate. Sweet vanilla and perfume stick around, along with red apples and a touch of butter; there's light brown sugar and cinnamon from the oak, as well as dry vanilla pods.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: A definite step up from the standard 12 Year Glenlivet - while this still doesn't have many challenging flavors, it's much richer and oilier than the entry level bottle. If you enjoy some classic ex-bourbon whisky notes of orchard fruit and baking spices, this could be a decent shout for you.

Review #116 - Balvenie 12 Year DoubleWood,34,15obe88,https://i.redd.it/sxnzphmxxhhb1.jpg,1691766350,,"[{'body': ""**Review #116 - Balvenie 12 Year DoubleWood**\r  \n\r  \n*12 Year Speysider Series: Part 2 of 7*\r  \n\r  \nPart two of the series is Balvenie - this is their 12 year 'DoubleWood,' pointing out that we're employing finishing casks, as opposed to full maturation in a single cask type. In this case, we starting with aging in 'whisky' oak - we're guessing this is likely refill ex-bourbon oak, at least predominantly. Then we spend time in sherry oak - in this case, casks made from European oak, which should impart some spice in addition to the fruit.\r  \n\r  \nLike our Macallan in the last review, this is bottled at 43% ABV, a bit below what we really want. Because of that strength (or lack thereof), this is probably chill filtered, an assumption which could be supported by this being a mass market, large scale brand that's built to appeal to a wide range of consumers. There's no statement on natural coloring, either, so we're going to assume it has some caramel added, as well.\r  \n\r  \n**Balvenie 12 Year DoubleWood**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 58 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: 'Whisky' oak and sherry casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 22 months; bottles at 70%, 50%, and 20% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Starts with a decent sherry influence - oranges, cinnamon spice, just a hint of sulfur, other savory baking spices as well. There's some savory red fruit, too, but despite all of these flavors, this isn't the richest nose - it certainly isn't jumping out of the glass. As it develops, we find ex-bourbon notes of vanilla and icing sugar, a hint of coconut, some caramel... bits of burnt sugar, like creme brulee topping. There's some smooth mild oak, and one time, just a hint of mellow cigar smoke.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: There's some sherry once again to start the palate - spices, red wine, caramel, cinnamon, and a slightly savory note. The mouthfeel is medium-thin, not too oily; some sweeter wood sugars and vanilla come into play, along with more coconut, and some mellow oak. There's a nice savory spice of paprika or rosemary, and at the end, a hint of coffee ice cream.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-short, pleasant warmth, and some slightly more bitter, dry wood now. The baking spices of vanilla and molasses stick around, along with a hint of red fruit, which turns toward exotic fruit. At the end, there's a hint of sweet taffy.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Another somewhat simple but pleasant sherried dram - not going to offend anyone with its mainstream flavors, but does offer a tasty sip when you're in that sherried whisky mood. It does seem to be a cask-dominated affair - not a lot of spirity notes left in it, which might make it 'smooth,' but it lacks a bit of depth. Value is decent - a lot cheaper than the Macallan we compared it with, so the value rating is well above average.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 6.5 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\r  \n\r  \n**Value Rating**: 6.76\r  \n\r  \n**About Us**: We're a husband and wife review team living in the Midwest United States.

Review #115 - Macallan 12 Year Sherry Oak Cask,33,15ne6yj,https://i.redd.it/8crhjl5cnahb1.jpg,1691678039,,"[{'body': ""**Review #115 - Macallan 12 Year Sherry Oak Cask**\r  \n\r  \n*12 Year Speysider Series: Part 1 of 7*\r  \n\r  \nToday we're starting a seven part series on 12 year Speyside whiskies, all from different distilleries - these are a many of your entry level, widely available, reasonably priced (sometimes) single malts, whiskies that introduce a lot of people to the hobby.\r  \n\r  \nWhat better place to start than Macallan? One of the most famous and well-sold 12 year Speyside whiskies (probably alongside Glenfiddich and Glenlivet), this bottle contains whisky aged in sherry-seasoned casks from Spain. There are actually three separate core range 12 year whiskies from Macallan - the Sherry Oak Cask, the Double Cask, and the Triple Cask. We're looking at the most expensive and well-regarded, the Sherry Oak Cask.\r  \n\r  \nMacallan does give us the information on the bottle that their whisky is natural color - that's a nice plus. It is bottled at 43% ABV, though, meaning it's a little weaker than we would like, and it's very likely chill filtered.\r  \n\r  \n**Macallan 12 Year Sherry Oak Cask**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 67 (2021)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 90 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Sherry casks from Jerez\r  \n**Details**: No color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 17 months; bottles at 60%, 40%, 20%, and 20% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Leaning very heavily into the sherry notes - dominant prune and raisin, clove and pepper, nutmeg and cinnamon, a light leather as well. It's rounded and warm, but there's this underlying musty note, sort of a dirty, old school character hiding beneath the red fruits. As the nose opens up, it turns toward purple grape and blood orange, and later on, it becomes slightly tart. Never too sweet in the first place, but far from bitter.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: It's a medium mouthfeel - lots of dried fruits again on the front of the palate, like tangy prune and strawberry, maybe some plums - pretty juicy at times, too. There's a little more of an oak influence on the palate compared to the nose, and it's bringing spices of pepper and chili, some clove and white pepper; there are sweeter notes of burnt sugar and molasses, as well. There's a hint of astringency, but with more time, this can open into a lighter stone fruit, evening bordering on banana. The longer it's aired out, though, the more watery it seems.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, tangy, and a little hot despite the 43% ABV. Again, it's sherry dominant, with warm baking spices and some red and orange fruit, but instead of sharp spice, it's turning toward sweetness from vanilla and cinnamon, even some cardamom. Relatively rich overall, just doesn't last too long.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is a decent whisky; Macallan gets some flak for their over-the-top marketing and luxury pricing despite mediocre presentation, but there is solid character in this distillate. It's too bad that it's given to us at 43% (or 40% in many markets), and is likely heavily filtered, because there's potential here - we like that dirty, old school character hiding below the sherry. Decent stuff, if a little simple, but price is the real issue - it's now $90 in our area, and we've heard it's even more expensive in some places. Not worth it at that point - there are too many other sherry bombs for less money in today's whisky market.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 6.6 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

I will add a few more that I do not see listed here just yet, with the obvious caveats (IMHO, to my taste):\n\nGlengoyne - pick the age and price which best suits you. The younger Glengoynes tend to be less sherried than their Macallan Sherry Oak equivalents, being closer in character to Macallan's Triple Cask and Double Cask series. But as they get older (18+ and especially the 21 yo and up) then Glengoynes get more sherried and the older ones are a substantial bargain compared with the price of a Macallan of similar age.\n\nMacallan and Glengoyne tend to taste very similar in flavor to me, when the level of sherry cask influence is comparable. Both of them were known years ago for using the Golden Promise variety of barley, that and a particularly clean style of malt seem to yield a similar range of flavors. While both of them appear to have gradually phased out their use of Golden Promise at some point in the last couple of decades (exactly when and how much is not well documented) they do seem to have retained a similarity to each other in flavor, in more contemporary releases.\n\nI mention this as something to keep in mind for later on, especially if you start climbing the age - price ladder into older and much more expensive bottlings, or something to keep an eye out for if you are in a bar or restaurant or at a whisky show, and have a chance to try one of these whiskies.\n\nOf contemporary unpeated sherried single malts that are more modest in age and price, each of Glenfarclas, Glendronach, and Arran are worth a try, to my taste. Each of them differs somewhat more so from the Macallan flavor profile than does Glengoyne which I mentioned above, so I think they are best enjoyed on their own merits rather than viewed as substitutes for Macallan.\n\nGlenfarclas tends to be somewhat floral, sharp and cidery in flavor, especially in younger bottlings. Glendronach is a little bit more spicy and dirty in character. Arran when heavily sherried (not all of them are so) tends to be rather clean and fruity, favoring berries.\n\nGlenturret has also been getting some good reviews in this subcategory. A key person from Macallan moved over to Glenturret recently, roughly coincident in time with a major rebranding of their lineup, and some reviewers have described their most recent bottlings as having a resemblance to Macallan. Unfortunately I cannot yet report back on them from personal experience however, so this is strictly hearsay.\n\nHope that helps, good luck!"", 'score': 7}, {'body': ""Bunnahabhain 12 would probably be the best value for your money, and Edradour 10 is also a great option that is objectively very similar. I'd also consider other options like Glenmorangie 14 and Glenallachie 12.

Review #114 - Yellowstone Kentucky Straight Bourbon,70,15mh9bm,https://i.redd.it/ssg5rfksj3hb1.jpg,1691592100,,"[{'body': ""**Review #114 - Yellowstone Kentucky Straight Bourbon**\n\nNow produced at Limestone Branch Distillery, the Yellowstone bourbon brand has been around for over 150 years, but ownership of the distilleries that produce it, as well as the brand name, has changed hands a number of times. It's been with the current owners since 2015, when they made a partnership with Luxco, who had owned the brand since the early 1990s.\n\nThere's no age statement on the bottle, but on the company's website, you can find that this bourbon is a blend of 4 year old and 7 year old whiskies. It's bottled at 93 proof - while this won't give us a flavor blast like a cask strength whisky, it's a nice step up from the typical 86 proof or 90 proof seen on many entry-level bourbon bottles.\n\n**Yellowstone Kentucky Straight Bourbon**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 36 (2021)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 31 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 46.5% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 20 months; bottles at 100%, 60%, 40% (blind tasting), and 30% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: This falls on the 'baking spice' side of bourbon - caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, candied nuts, some wildflower honey as well; it really isn't too sweet despite those notes. The oak is somewhat dry and sharp, and it contributes more spice like anise and nutmeg, before fresh leather and a bit of younger spirit influence creep in. It can be a little earthy at times, but overall, it's somewhat reserved, the smells not jumping from the glass. We end with some baked bread, or even a hint of banana bread.\n\n**Palate**: Decent amount of spice and a lot of oak on the palate, dry and slightly tannic. There are vanilla pods, nuts, and some orange rind, a nice mixture, before black pepper and barrel spice break through and dominate. The mouthfeel is medium - not too oily, and slightly watery in one of the tastings we did. With more time, a light perfume note comes in.\n\n**Finish**: It's a medium length finish, pleasantly warm and spice, but not too hot. Dry wood, oak tannins, a hint of corn grain, and tangy orange all come together and blend, and it's topped with brown sugar and even white sugar. Relatively pleasant, if a bit simple.\n\n**Final Note**: We like that this isn't too sweet for a bourbon - a bit more balanced in that respect. That said, it is somewhat simple, and some tastings gave the impression of a 'one note' or 'two note' whisky - mostly oak and spice like pepper and nutmeg. Still, this is fine, just... a little boring. As for value - not bad, considering this is relatively affordable, in the $30 to $35 range.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 5.3 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\n\n**Value Rating**: 6.52\n\n**About Us**: We're a husband and wife review team living in the Midwest United States. Generally, our reviews and tasting notes will be a compilation of both of our experiences with a whisky over several tasting sessions.\n\nInterested in more?

Review #113 - Hotel Tango Bourbon,27,15klfhe,https://i.redd.it/kmuv7hjn1pgb1.jpg,1691416506,,"[{'body': 'The packaging is amusing for those of us who have ever eaten an MRE before (there needs to be a ""rock or something"" joke in there somewhere)   \n\n\nBut I\'m always suspicious of ""gimmick"" packaged booze.....It sounds like it\'s about what I expected.  It\'s fine.', 'score': 13}, {'body': ""**Review #113 - Hotel Tango Bourbon**\n\nToday, a bourbon from a small distillery - this is from Hotel Tango, based in Indianapolis, Indiana. Started by Travis and Hilary Barnes, the distillery gets its name from the couple's initials, using the NATO phonetic alphabet; they opened in 2014, so we're nearing the distillery's 10 year anniversary. In addition to this bourbon, the distillery also produces a reserve bourbon, a rye, and a number of other unaged spirits like vodka, gin, and fruit liqueurs.\n\nThis bottle is their entry level bourbon - it's bottled at 45% ABV or 90 proof, and sports an age statement of two years in the fine print on the back label. Being a young distillery, this liquid could be changing quite quickly, so we think it's only fair we point out the fact that we bought this bottle two or three years ago - it's possible the newer whisky has evolved a little bit, or possibly even changed from sourced to their own distillate.\n\n**Hotel Tango Bourbon**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 30 (2021)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 27 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: 2 Years\n\n**Strength**: 45% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 18 months; bottles at 100%, 50%, and 20% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Light and a little fruity to start - green apple, lemon juice, some orange as well. Balanced between sweet and dry, and some oak begins to arrive, followed by fresh cut grass and a light brown sugar. There is some ethanol or nail polish remover in the nose, and with time, the oak turns a little more bitter; lower in the glass, it's peppery and slightly astringent, and we end with a whiff of a sour cocktail.\n\n**Palate**: Hot orange and apple, some cinnamon and vanilla, relatively light and clean. Despite the fruits and spices, this isn't particularly sweet - dry oak and some bitter tannins soak in, and we get a perfume flavor that turns back toward that chemical ethanol from the nose. The mouthfeel is medium-thin, and after the fruit and oak notes fade, we have some nutmeg and anise, maybe a bit of brown sugar.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-short, a little hot and thin. There are baking spices of pepper and dry vanilla, but also more of that chemical acetone, some oak, and a cloying, sickly sweet floral note.\n\n**Final Note**: Needs a little more time in the barrel to mellow out those chemical notes, as well as develop a better mouthfeel. There are some nice bright fruits in the nose, but it turns toward oak and spice through the palate, and not necessarily in the best way.

There is a little bit of sweetness from oaky vanilla, and just a hint of charred wood, but this is still pretty soft and mild.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is quite restrained - the flavors aren't bad, but the low bottling strength is really holding it back. It's pretty simple and relatively easy-sipping, but the theme from these big-box bottlings continues: not many interesting flavor notes, not a lot of complexity to hold your attention. The price of this Creag Isle is climbing as well, meaning that its value is eroding - it's about $50 in our area at this point. There are a number of other whiskies at that price point that offer a bit more complexity and stronger flavor.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 5.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

They also own Glengoyne and Tamdhu (and the newly rebuilt lowland Rosebank), which could point to possible source of the liquid, but the company also releases whiskies under a number of other blending brands, so they likely have access to casks outside their own portfolio of distilleries.\r  \n\r  \nThis 12 year Shieldaig comes with the big-box special: 40% ABV presentation, no statements on chill filtering or coloring (likely plenty of both), and very little real information on the packaging... it's mostly marketing gibberish about Scottish geography.\r  \n\r  \n**Shieldaig 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 38 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 40% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 100% fill level at time of review.

There's some fresh baked bread as well - this is on the light side in general, with vanilla and pancakes coming in, some honey, too. We do get mild baking spices and just a soft oak influence with more time, along with hints of red or orange fruits.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Lots of sugary notes - this is a thin palate, though. Sugary, vanilla, some sugar cookie flavors, but it also turns slightly more dry and bitter later on. Fibrous oak, some sour apple, underripe pear, and a bland biscuit all come in, and we end with some more breadiness.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is short, with more fruits: white grape, mellow apple, and pear all come to mind. There are some baking spices floating in, both nutty and sweet: clove, nutmeg, vanilla are all here. It's relatively soft on this finish, and trails off rather quickly.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Soft and easy, your classic ex-bourbon Speyside flavor profile, but a bit weak and boring at times.

Review #109 - Grangestone 12 Year,15,15eg54b,https://i.redd.it/lnse9lmsxafb1.jpg,1690809859,,"[{'body': ""**Review #109 - Grangestone 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*'Big-Box Retailer' Scotch Series: Part 3 of 6*\r  \n\r  \nThe next Total Wine whisky we're looking at is actually a return to Grangestone - instead of the NAS sherry cask from last week, this is the aged-stated 12 year old. Bottled by William Grant & Sons, this is another unnamed distillery's distillate, presented at 40% ABV. There's no information on cask regimen on the packaging, but based on the taste, we're going to guess it's primarily ex-bourbon maturation.\r  \n\r  \n**Grangestone 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 38 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 40% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 100% fill level at time of review.

Red apples and other orchard fruits, some mild cinnamon, but the medium-thin mouthfeel begins to limit the amount of flavor coming through. Not too oily, but pleasant to sip on, if a bit plain.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-short finish, pretty mild and still on the sweeter side. A few orchard and stone fruits of pear, peach, and apple, and some barrel spice creeps in, adding a bit of baking spice as well.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Sort of pleasant and inoffensive, but the low strength starts to take away from the experience in the palate.

Review #108 - Bothan Sherry Expression,16,15bzghx,https://i.redd.it/y9tuejrgxpeb1.jpg,1690555510,,"[{'body': ""**Review #108 - Bothan Sherry Expression**\r  \n\r  \n*'Big-Box Retailer' Scotch Series: Part 2 of 6*\r  \n\r  \nPart 2 of this Total Wine/Spirits Direct scotch series, we have a Lowland single malt - The Bothan, specifically the sherry cask expression (they also have an ex-bourbon expression). No age statement, but we do get a slight bump in ABV compared to the Shieldaig we last reviewed - it's 43% now, instead of 40%. Not quite integrity presentation as we generally expect it, but we're making progress.\r  \n\r  \nAs is generally the case with these Spirits Direct labels, the whisky is from an undisclosed distillery. It's likely relatively young given the price point, and because of the volume of liquid going through Total Wine stores, this is probably from a larger distillery. There are several large Lowland distilleries that have opened in the last few years, along with a couple of long-standing options, so it's a bit harder to pinpoint the source of this one. The Bothan brand is owned by Alexander Murray & Co., which doesn't necessarily help with the sourcing information (as far as we know).\r  \n\r  \nSo, to the review - will this Bothan Sherry Expression fare better than our Shieldaig yesterday?\r  \n\r  \n**Bothan Sherry Expression**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Lowlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 33 (2022)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 35 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon barrels and ex-sherry hogsheads\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 12 months; bottles at 100% (blind tasting), 90% (blind tasting), 80%, and 100% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Mellow and airy and crisp - there's definitely some of that sherry cask influence up front, with red fruits of plum and grape, but this gradually turns into an orchard fruit bomb (well, as much of a 'bomb' as it can be at 43%). We're getting green apple and pear, some orange, as well as lots of grapefruit. There's a hint of minerality, some vanilla and lemongrass accenting it, but there does come a point where a hint of youth is coming through, with a mild cereal grain as well. Not smoky, generally sweet and nice.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium-thin, there's a nice moderate warmth, and fruits are again the dominant feature - both dark sherry fruits like plum and fig, but also grapefruit and raspberries, even a raisin from time to time. There are more baking notes now, too: brown sugar, cinnamon, almost a cinnamon applesauce; vanilla is plentiful, and it's accented by a hint of sickly sweet perfume. The oak is pretty subdued, and after some cardamom and clove, sharper orange and a spirit note peek through.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is medium length, someone soft and easy-drinking now, lots of brown sugar and citrus, as well as some sparkly orange soda. We still get bits of fruit in the form of red apples and dried prune, but the oak and baking spices take over a little more, with nutmeg and a hint of pepper. The longer the finish lasts, the more it mellows out into a buttery red wine taste; at the end, just bits of mineral water and orange wine.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Not overly complex, not necessarily a sherry bomb, but a pretty nice sipper with a pleasant mix of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry flavors. It can be a little sweet at times, but it finds more balance on the palate and into the finish when the wood and baking spices come in. This is easily the best Spirits Direct whisky we've tried... we aren't likely to recommend many of them, but if you want a budget sipper with plenty of fruity character, this isn't a bad buy.

Review #107 - Grangestone Sherry Cask Finish,37,15b34nj,https://i.redd.it/4phat9lwnieb1.jpg,1690467543,,"[{'body': 'Imagine my sadness...\n\nWife said she did ""a lot of research"" to find a bottle for my birthday. $250 for an offering from Grangestone.

While these stores often carry a large variety of whisky brands we all know, they also often have house brands stocking their shelves in large quantities. These are provided by independent bottlers or blenders, and information about the actual distillery or other details of the spirit is often very limited, purposefully opaque.\r  \n\r  \nIn the series, we're going to focus specifically on retail brands commonly found at Total Wine in the USA, a chain that opened a store in our geographical area just a couple years ago for the first time. These come under brand names like Shieldaig, Grangestone, Bothan, and Creag Isle, just to name a few. If you ever find yourself in the Scotch aisle at a Total Wine, you're likely to be steered toward these if you ask for buying advice.\r  \n\r  \nOnto the specific whisky we're looking at today - it's Grangestone, specifically the double-matured Sherry Cask Finish bottling. This is a NAS highland scotch whisky presented at an entry-level 40% ABV, priced at about $33 in our area, so it's definitely budget-friendly. No word on where exactly this was distilled, but based on the number of stores run by Total Wine, it's likely a very high-volume producer from the Highlands. The Grangestone brand is owned by Quality Spirits International, which falls under the William Grant & Sons umbrella (owners of Glenfiddich, Balvenie, Kininvie, and more) - that might lend an idea of the origins.\r  \n\r  \nOne last note - gotta love the marketing speak on these bottles. This Grangestone Sherry Cask Finish was matured in 'specially selected' white oak casks, before it was finished in 'premium' sherry casks.\r  \n\r  \n**Grangestone Sherry Cask Finish**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 33 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 40% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: American white oak barrels, finished in sherry casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 13 months; bottles at 100%, 100%, and 40% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Somewhat dry and slightly muted to start, there's definitely some sherry influence, but it's far from overpowering. Pretty clearly young and grain-forward (yes it's all malt, but tastes grainy), and actually a decent amount of oak despite the likely young age, but the wood isn't entirely well-integrated with the spirit. We get baking spices of cinnamon and white pepper, some toasted oak and creamy vanilla as well, along with fruits of raisin and grape, some sour orange, too. The lower strength is noticeable in the nose, but we end with a nice, mild perfume note.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is thin and a bit watery, and we get a continuation of the nose flavors: oak (which is sweeter now), vanilla and cinnamon, some grainy notes, and some grape as well. Somewhat balanced between sweet and dry at this point, an easy sipper, and then a strong nutty flavor builds, nutty oak and toasted peanuts. As the palate develops further, a hint of acetone appears and the oak grows slightly bitter.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, and that nuttiness from the mid-palate lingers a while, though the overall complexion turns sweeter. There's cooling sherry but also white wine, some white grapes, a mild baking spices, some muffins. We have spices of clove and vanilla pods, and at the end, a hint of chalky chocolate.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: The nuttiness was a nice surprise, but otherwise, this is a bit unremarkable. Easy to sip, but a bit boring and flat - feels young, and possibly some over-used refill casks used in aging. There was a nice cinnamon spice at times as well, but... we're running out of positives to look at. Still, this does cost about $30 - could be a budget-friendly way to get started in the hobby, especially if you aren't used to higher-proof spirits.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 4.7 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Its such a solid bourbon that's good neat or in an old fashion. \n\nI'm today's market you aren't going to find whiskey that's out performing whiskey double it's price. The established brands have figured out their pricing tiers and what complexity to offer at each."", 'score': 19}, {'body': ""**Review #106 - Wild Turkey 101**\n\nWild Turkey 101 - one of the most well-known and best-selling bourbons - has gained notoriety in the whisky community for having solid character and presenting a great value proposition due to its reasonable pricing. It's bottled at 50.5%, as well, only increasing the value, so this is a bottle we keep on our shelf. We've gone through three or four bottles of it in the last few years, so we figured it's time for a review.\n\nWe don't have an age statement, but rumor has it that this is generally aged for 6 years or so before bottling. It sports a mashbill of 75% corn, 13% rye, and 12% malted barley, so we may get some spice wrapped up in those layers of classic bourbon sweetness.\n\n**Wild Turkey 101**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 19 (2021)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 21 (2023)\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 50.5% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 19 months; bottles at 50%, 90%, 60% (blind tasting), and 50% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Brown sugar plus a kick of dry oak on the nose, spice and a mild heat. It really isn't too sweet overall - leans a little dry, with dusty grain and peanut, anise, clove, and charcoal. When there are sweet notes, they present as vanilla and red fruit like cherries, maybe a hint of banana at times, too. The oak grows buttery and damp with more air time and at the end, a hint of boozy bananas foster rum sauce.\n\n**Palate**: Plenty of spice again, but also some sweetness to balance it. The medium mouthfeel is full of pepper and clove, spiced orange and burnt orange rind, wood chips from a smoker, anise, some smoked paprika at times. There is more of that rum sauce and a bit of caramel bringing the sugary side, some vanilla and sweeter cinnamon, too. After a bit of cherry, there are some grainy and nutty notes, maybe a hint of straw.\n\n**Finish**: Warm and medium length in the finish, muted spices of clove, pepper, and cinnamon once again. The oak is rich but not overdone, and it adds some tickling anise and a nice Kentucky hug when paired with the strength of the spirit. At the end, bits of red fruit and a mild raw banana.\n\n**Final Note**: A solid bourbon, but to us, not exceptional. This is a $20 bourbon, so maybe it isn't supposed to be that special? Maybe some truth to that, but this gets so much hype in the community, maybe we were expecting more. Still, it's a solid sipper, and absolutely killer in a spirit-forward cocktail. Because of its reasonable price, it's at the top of the value heap, too - very strong recommendation to try this one. We always keep it around.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 5.8 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\n\n**Value Rating**: 8.65\n\n**About Us**: We're a husband and wife review team living in the Midwest United States.

People who usually buy Evan Williams for $11 might think WT is a step above average, and people who have the money to regularly buy $100-$200 luxury bourbons might think WT pricing is way below average.\n\nSince the prices generally increase exponentially (as opposed to geometrically) when you get into the high quality stuff, we factor the price by an exponent of 1/3 to reflect that, when you get into those higher price brackets, there’s still improvement in quality, but it’s diminishing returns.\n\nThe goal was really to get the average value relatively close to our average rating - this equation does that, roughly.\n\nAlways happy to discuss more!', 'score': 2}, {'body': ""Drain pour?

Most of the bottles from Loch Lomond are still very reasonably priced - for instance, we can get the 18 Year for about $95, half the price of an 18 Year Talisker or Highland Park in our area, or a quarter of the cost of a bottle of Macallan 18.\r  \n\r  \nLoch Lomond is unusual in the types of stills they use to distill their spirit. In addition to the traditional 'lantern'/'swan-neck' pot stills used in single malt Scotch production, they also employ straight-necked pot stills (which look like a mash-up between pot and column stills), a continuous column still, and a Coffey still. Using this unique combination of different still types, the distillery produces several varieties of whisky styles labeled as different brands:\r  \n\\-Loch Lomond: Fruity with a light hint of peat\r  \n\\-Inchmoan: Peated Loch Lomond spirit\r  \n\\-Inchmurrin: Straight-necked pot still are used to give a lighter, floral, fruity character\r  \n\\-Single Grains/Single Blends: Using the continuous/Coffey stills, these cannot technically be classified as single malts under SWA regulations, despite the fact that they're still made from 100% barley\r  \n\r  \nToday we're looking at the 12 Year Old from the 'standard' Loch Lomond brand, probably the bottle that most represents their core character in the entry-level category. It comes in at a strength of 46% with no chill filtration, but there's no statement about coloring - rumor has it that some is still added, at least up until the last year or so.\r  \n\r  \n**Loch Lomond 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 40 (2021)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 40 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 15 months; bottles at 100%, 90% (blind tasting), 80%, and 70% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Interesting but subtle to start, some mild oak and vanilla sugar like ex-bourbon maturation, but also some dark dried red fruit, dehydrated oranges, a bit of raisin, too. There's a hint of smoke in there, but only wisps... some spice is added from the oak, pepper and clove and salt. There is definitely a bit of spirit character in here, slightly funky and maybe some old barrel funk or a 'dunnage' note. More red fruits of freeze-dried raspberry and red wine arrive, before some sherbet and savory melon finish us off.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium, just hints of oils that pull in a whiff of smoke, a mild dry spirit character, and then plenty of spices. That spice really does end up being the star of the palate: cinnamon, red pepper flakes, spicy Malbec wine, some nutmeg as well; the smoke turns slightly ashy later, more like wood smoke. There's a grainy, barley sugar side to this coming from the base spirit, and with more time, orange, apple, and a hint of sour stone fruit develop. This feels sort of 'classic,' but still slightly simple, and at the end, a little more water down. Oak is mild overall, and we end with a hint of barbecued orange.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, and some of those wood notes start to prickle like tannins. It becomes more dry overall, with spices of pepper, cinnamon, and brown sugar lingering, along with stronger spirit influence and sour apples. There's a bit of orange citrus here, too, along with dried grass and oats, some honey-coated figs and vanilla.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: There are plenty of tasting notes to pick through, but this feels a bit... inconsistent. Not quite punchy enough with the flavors, but a bit more subtle and ever-changing. That can be a good thing, but this time, there's just something about it that feels more average. Still, a decent whisky, and because of the excellent price (still $40 in our area), this gets a very good value rating. A solid pick for a daily sipper, but won't blow you away with complexity in any one tasting.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 6.4 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\r  \n\r  \n**Value Rating**: 7.46\r  \n\r  \nAbout Us: We're a husband and wife review team living in the Midwest United States.

They have done a number of their own barrel picks, and here we have their 6th pick from Knob Creek, titled 'Secret Stash.' It was aged a bit over 9 years, and they bottled it at 120 proof, like many of the barrel select Knob Creeks.\n\nKnob Creek/Jim Beam provides a plethora of ages and releases with their bourbon and rye - along with these 'barrel select' products, there are bourbons with age statements of 9 years (100 proof), 9 years (single barrel reserve, 120 proof), 12 years (100 proof), 15 years (100 proof), and 18 years (100 proof), as well as multiple ryes in the mix. Plenty of options to choose from, depending on what profile you like.\n\n**Knob Creek 9 Year Single Barrel Select - Wiseguy Lounge Pick**\n\n*USA - Bourbon*\n\n**Price Paid**: USD 50 (2022)\n\n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 55 (2023) (for a similar product)\n\n**Age Statement**: 9 Years\n\n**Strength**: 60% ABV\n\n**Details**: Wiseguy Lounge pick #6 'Secret Stash,' barreled 2011-10-20, bottled 2021-04-14 (9 years and 5 months old); picked from Warehouse Z, 4th floor, rick 74\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 8 months; bottles at 100%, 80%, 40% (blind tasting), and 20% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Dessert-like to start, brown butter truffle ice cream and some candied pecans, but also salted nuts and dark brown sugar/molasses. There is some light, dry oak, which becomes richer and fuller with time, and it's accented by some dusty grain and corn sweetness. There are wisps of fruit like orange rind and maybe a Luxardo cherry, but those are subtle flavors, and end up covered by vanilla sugar.\n\n**Palate**: More heat in the palate, a medium-thick mouthfeel and it's oily and syrupy. Oak is really strong now, spicy and nutty, almost a bit too much oak. Lots of baking spices in the forms of pepper, nutmeg, and red pepper flakes, and with the corn influence, there's almost a sort of 'spicy Mexican street corn' vibe. There's maple wood and some salted peanut later on.\n\n**Finish**: Warm and oaky, a little more simple on the palate - it's still oily and probably medium-long in length, but a lot of the sweetness has dissipated, leaving mostly a peppery tickle and anise, some nutmeg as well.\n\n**Final Note**: This packs plenty of flavor with that punchy ABV, but it's also coming across as over-oaked as the bottle is open longer; the nose had some nice flavor development, but through the palate and into the finish, the whole experience becomes a bit simpler.

Review #103 - Aberlour A'bunadh Batch 70,31,154sql1,https://i.redd.it/wxbnmprzs4db1.jpg,1689863910,,"[{'body': ""**Review #103 - Aberlour A'bunadh Batch 70**\r  \n\r  \nBatch variation is a hot topic in whisky in general - this Aberlour is one of the examples brought up most often. This conversation often revolves around the earlier batches of the A'bunadh (batches 20-40) compared with the more current batches (60+), but we wanted to look at a more micro-scale comparison reflective of our time in the whisky hobby. Here are some highlights of batches 60 through 77, based on aggregated WhiskyBase ratings.\r  \n\r  \n\\-Batches 60 through 64 - average score around 86.5\r  \n\\-Batches 73 through 77 - average score around 85.3\r  \n\\-For reference, Batches 10 through 30 averaged a score around 87.7\r  \n\r  \nNot necessarily a dramatic drop over the course of the last 17 batches, but an undeniable gradual downward slope. What's the cause of this drop? Is it less well-aged stock used in the mix, or a decline in the distillate, or the quality of the casks being used? Hard to say for sure, but something is surely changing.\r  \n\r  \nAberlour A'bunadh is a cask strength single malt, not age stated, with full maturation is Oloroso sherry butts. Our batch, 70 specifically, was bottled in April 2021, around the middle of the range we looked at. We bought it at $77 a couple of years ago, and we've been pretty lucky to see the price stay there in our market.\r  \n\r  \n**Aberlour A'bunadh Batch 70**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Speyside - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 77 (2021)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 77 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 61.2% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Spanish oak Oloroso sherry butts\r  \n**Details**: Batch 070, bottled 2021-04-29; not chill filtered\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 14 months; bottles at 90%, 70%, 70% (blind tasting), and 60% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Rich and full of dark fruits, juicy Malbec wine and cherries, orange and fig and red grape. There's quite a bit of baking spice in here: cinnamon is the most obvious, like cinnamon red hot candies, but also brown sugar and caramel, vanilla, hazelnut, and chocolate cookies. Past all of these sweet notes, there's a dry side of oak and dry grass, some tannins, wood sugars, and a bit of heat from the strength. We end with bits of lemon citrus and leather.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Oily and powerful, on the sweet side, with a thick mouthfeel. The sherry-style fruits of prune, raisin, and fig are plentiful, but we also get some strawberry and mulled wine. On the spice side, lots of black pepper and cinnamon, hot spiced cider and a sharper nutty flavor; there's nutmeg and some dry oak... this is actually a pretty oak-forward experience, bourbon-like at times. Sugary notes of molasses and Tootsie Roll are sprinkled in, some smooth caramel and cherry cola come and go.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long and quite warm - the oily, velvety texture lingers into the finish, providing lots of sticky dark fruits and mulled wine along the way. Still a decent amount of oak, with spices of cinnamon, clove, and cardamom coming along, but also sweeter tones of vanilla and brown sugar. Spicy all the way to the end, and this is a cozy experience in retrospect.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is a tasty bottle, but we wouldn't call it exceptional. The strength does allow plenty of flavor to come across, especially in the forms of dark fruit and spice, but the notes end there. Not a whole lot of spirit signature hanging around - this is all about the cask. If we're going to focus solely on the barrels used in aging, then we wouldn't mind seeing this aged a bit longer to get some more mature oak flavors mixed in.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.3 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Many will love the decanter-style glass that this whisky comes in (though we find it too wide and awkwardly tall to fit well on a shelf full of whiskies), but we're more worried about the taste of the liquid inside.\n\nWillett's Pot Still Reserve is now supposedly made in-house, but was rumored to be sourced distillate for quite some time before that. It was originally a single barrel product (would love to try one of those), but now comes as a batched whisky, bottled at 47% ABV. Nothing like cask strength, but it's nice to see it at an integrity presentation strength.

There is caramel and molasses sugar, some baking spices of clove and nutmeg and caramelized sugar, but a sort of nail polish/acetone creeps forward at the same time. It can be a little grainy and slightly earthy, but there is some cherry fruit to balance that. In individual tastings we found Coca-Cola and coppery metal; with time, the oak becomes a bit more bitter or sour.\n\n**Palate**: Warming despite a medium-thin mouthfeel, quite oaky and both sweet and spicy. Vanilla, black pepper, cough syrup, spearmint, licorice, and brown sugar all come to mind; there's caramel and anise as well, not too fruit, but heavy in the oak and spice flavors. Oak continues to grow in intensity, and it becomes a bit more dry and tannic as the palate develops, bordering on over-oaked.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length with pepper and nutmeg, some clove, plenty of those baking spices to go around. There's an interesting purple grape and caramel combination bringing a hint of sweetness, but this jumps back into tannic oak relatively quickly. Somewhat simple and dry.\n\n**Final Note**: If you want to pay $50 for a decent decanter, this is one isn't too hard to find these days.\n\n**Our Average Rating**: 4.7 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Drain Pour\n\n1 - Awful\n\n2 - Bad\n\n3 - Flawed\n\n4 - Below Average\n\n5 - Average / Mediocre\n\n6 - Above Average / Decent\n\n7 - Good\n\n8 - Great\n\n9 - Excellent\n\n10 - Perfect\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #101 - Ralfy's DIY Blends,56,152afox,https://i.redd.it/tw0h9bqcnkcb1.jpg,1689619874,,"[{'body': ""**Review #101 - Ralfy's DIY Blends**\r  \n\r  \nA fun little experiment for today's review(s) - we're sampling and rating a few simple blends created with a base of Glenfiddich 12, after which we add varying (small) amounts of a heavily peated whisky, Ardbeg 10. The theoretical blend would end up as a blended malt with a 10 year age statement.\r  \n\r  \nEarly on in his Youtube journey, Ralfy posted this review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9CKShEI6F8&list=WL&index=1 , in which he completes this same experiment, adding a tiny amount of Ardbeg in gradually increasing volumes to glasses of Glenfiddich 12. He breaks down the differences between the individual blends, explaining how subtle changes in blending recipes can create striking differences in the blends themselves. Because the flavors of peated whiskies are quite strong, he recommends adding very small amounts of the Ardbeg when starting out, or it could easily overpower the subtler Glenfiddich.\r  \n\r  \nWe generally followed his recipe combining the following amounts of the whiskies:\r  \n\t\\-Glass 1: 20ml Glenfiddich 12, 3 drops (\\~0.15ml) Ardbeg 10\r  \n\t\\-Glass 2: 20ml Glenfiddich 12, 6 drops (\\~0.30ml) Ardbeg 10\r  \n\t\\-Glass 3: 20ml Glenfiddich 12, 10 drops (\\~0.50ml) Ardbeg 10\r  \nAfter swirling the glasses to mix the spirits, they were allowed to rest for an hour while covered to allow some time for combination.\r  \n\r  \nFor those interested in more like this, there's a whole subreddit dedicated to home blending of whisky! Join the conversation at r/WhiskeyFrankenstein/\r  \n\r  \n**Ralfy's DIY Blends**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland - Blend*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: \\~USD 47 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: Varies - 40% to 46% ABV\r  \n**Details**: Three blends of Glenfiddich 12 and Ardbeg 10 with varying proportions\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: We reviewed these back to back after blending, with small pours of both Glenfiddich 12 and Ardbeg 10 for baseline comparison. Each blend was tasted in a Glencairn glass, rested (covered) for 60 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Blend with the least (3 drops/ 0.15ml) of Ardbeg**\r  \n*Nose*: Green apple and agave, slightly spirity, sharp sugar, very very soft smoke, hint of brine\r  \n*Palate*: Very light smoke but noticeable different to standard Glenfiddich 12; acrid wood smoke, medium-thin mouthfeel, burnt sugar\r  \n*Finish*: Sweet wood smoke lingers, green-ish, lemon, white pepper, biscuits at the end\r  \n*Final Note*: Nicely fruity and spirity, but very close to Glenfiddich 12\r  \n*Our Rating*: 6.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Blend with middle amount (6 drops/ 0.30ml) of Ardbeg**\r  \n*Nose*: Wood smoke, vanilla, more grainy, white grape, a bit sweet and buttery\r  \n*Palate*: Smoke is slightly stronger, burnt orange, baking notes, grainy, biscuits\r  \n*Finish*: Medium length, hint of char; later, becomes more candied, green apple caramel lollipop\r  \n*Final Note*: Interestingly, much more grainy, feels a bit less refined. Apple notes from the nose are entirely gone\r  \n*Our Rating*: 5.5 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Blend with the most (10 drops/ 0.50ml) of Ardbeg**\r  \n*Nose*: Smoke is still mild but noticeably stronger than others; white pepper, weaker green apple, baking spice, strong spirit note\r  \n*Palate*: Orchard fruits come back stronger, mild peat, feels fuller with building peat, hint of char\r  \n*Finish*: Medium length, medium smokiness in the finish, watery pears, hint of oak\r  \n*Final Note*: Most noticeable smoke, especially on the finish. Apple and pear orchard fruits return after the middle sample, the best of the bunch\r  \n*Our Rating*: 6.5 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Overall Thoughts**: Yes, they did end up somewhat similar, but with time, there were definitely noticeable differences. The first sample brought nice sweetness and fruit flavors, while the smoke was quite reserved; the second sample ended up with amplified grainy notes, which we weren't a huge fan of. The last sample was clearly the smokiest, with more baking spice and pepper notes. It was impressive how smoky that final sample was, despite the Ardbeg 10 making up just \\~2.5% of the volume.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, an interesting experiment, and one we'll try again with some other whiskies. Ralfy clearly has an experienced palate based on the ease with which he picked up the differences between these (took us much longer), and his advice to experiment at home with whisky to gain more perspective seems to ring true. The smallest changes in blending makeup can lead to much more substantial changes in flavor - whether that be for large scale blends, or batch variations in single malts.\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\r  \n\r  \n**Value Rating**: 6.65 (average of the three samples, based on Glenfiddich 12 and Ardbeg 10 bottle prices)\r  \n\r  \n**About Us**: We're a husband and wife review team living in the Midwest United States.

Review #100 - Lagavulin 16 Year,142,14zhto9,https://i.redd.it/bbk5nkdywxbb1.jpg,1689344654,,"[{'body': ""**Review #100 - Lagavulin 16 Year**\r  \n\r  \nFor the 100th review, we figured that, instead of picking a new, special bottle for review, we would look back at where we started a year ago: Lagavulin 16 Year, our first review, and the whisky that started our passion for this hobby.\r  \n\r  \nOur palates have changed in the last year to a degree that's been pretty noticeable. We find ourselves seeking out higher strength, more naturally presented whiskies, and while we always had some degree of interest in world whiskies, we are searching for new styles and whiskies with new countries of origin more regularly now. When looking at Scotch specifically (still our favorite category, if we had to pick), we still do love these peated single malts, but we also find our favoritism drifting toward the style of unpeated or mildly peated whiskies, especially with exclusively (or close to it) ex-bourbon maturation. Given another year or two, I'm sure our tastes will have changed once more.\r  \n\r  \nA quick word about this bottle of whisky, too, since that's what we're actually here to do - this is Lagavulin 16 Year, a teenage peaty Islay whisky that ages in a mixture of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks. It's known as one of the most common whiskies that introduces enthusiasts to this hobby - we were two of those people, when we first tasted it at a family member's home five or so years ago. The 16 Year is known for its balanced sweetness and its coastal smoke, which is strong but not quite to the levels of neighbors Laphroaig and Ardbeg. This bottling has the Diageo special, too: 43% ABV instead of 46%+, coloring added, and chill filtration.\r  \n\r  \n*A quick note - we're also adjusting our rating scale a bit, so that it's less complicated and closer to the scale used by many of the reviewers here, the 1 to 10 T8ke scale. In our case, this will probably result in a slight drop in our ratings, on average.*\r  \n\r  \nAnyways, enough rambling... let's dig into this single malt.\r  \n\r  \n**Lagavulin 16 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 93 (2022)\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 93 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 16 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 3 months; bottles at 50%, 40% (blind tasting), 30%, and 20% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: It's nice, a sort of 'jack of all trades' when it comes to the combination of sherry and peat - slightly medicinal smoke, salinity, some dry wood smoke or char as well, but also burnt ends barbecue, savory blood orange, glazed strawberries, even cherries. There is some nice buttery oak showing some age, along with an elegant perfume note, but despite these, this is still fresh and saucy and tangy. Lots of balsamic vinegar and green moss, and in one tasting, bitter prunes and dark chocolate. Rich but not overbearing, and very well balanced.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium-thin - that extra aging is really at odds with the low bottling strength. Peat is strong now but kept in check by lots of fruit: orange, juicy raisin, a sharp peach and some lime. The smoke turns a little more woody, and while still relatively balanced, this turns slightly more toward the bitter and savory end of the palate: dry wood and char, dry barbecue and salty pretzels, tannins, hot peppers, peppercorns. That said, there are subtle sweet notes of vanilla and sugary oil (think simple syrup); while still a well-rounded experience, this feels more watery with time.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: A medium length finish, bordering medium-long at times; soft sweet peat and more mild barbecue smoke, fig and orange chicken, orange zest and sweet peppers. There are some mature notes of dark chocolate and unsmoked tobacco leaf later on, but the oak has a pretty mild influence in the finish, leaving room for greenish notes and some coastal salt. We end with sweet fruit jams.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Is this rating still a bit high? This is chill-filtered, colored whisky presented at a strength lower than we expect for a quality release. Does Diageo still have a long way to go in terms of changing their malt whisky bottling policies to make them appeal to us enthusiasts? Yes, of course they do. But does this whisky still have brilliant underlying character and excellent balance? We think it does. Our rating has dropped a little bit as our palate grows more experienced - in the last year alone, we've tried close to 300 different bottles/samples, an experience which really puts this Lagavulin into perspective. Does it still hold a certain special place in our heart? Yes, it still does. If we can find it at a reasonable price (less than $90), we'll probably still replace it when our current bottle is gone.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.8 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Drain Pour\r  \n1 - Awful\r  \n2 - Bad\r  \n3 - Flawed\r  \n4 - Below Average\r  \n5 - Average / Mediocre\r  \n6 - Above Average / Decent\r  \n7 - Good\r  \n8 - Great\r  \n9 - Excellent\r  \n10 - Perfect\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

This specifically is an 8 year old bottling with a 2013 vintage, made up of barley grown exclusively on Islay, but on a variety of farms on the island.\r  \n\r  \nHaving already looked at the unpeated Islay Barley variety and the super heavily peated Octomore Islay Barley variety from this distillery, the Port Charlotte might represent a nice middling balance between the other two. It's also the oldest age statement of the three despite spending only eight years in the cask, so we might have a little more refinement and roundness as well. Cask types were unspecified on the bottle, but from the tasting, it seemed that at least a good portion of the maturation took place in ex-bourbon casks - research showed this to be true, but 25% of the maturation also took place in first-fill ex-red wine casks, for an added twist.\r  \n\r  \n**Bruichladdich Port Charlotte 8 Year Islay Barley 2013**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 83 (2023)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 8 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 50% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: 75% Ex-bourbon, 25% Pessac-Leognan red wine casks\r  \n**Details**: No color added, not chill filtered; distilled 2013, barley grown on the Coull, Island, Mulindry, Dunlossit Estate, Cruach, Rockside, and Sunderland farms\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 3 months; bottles at 100%, 80%, and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Quite farmy and green - hay, agave, vegetable oil, seaweed, mossy wood, and a slight funk, too. There are fruits of lemon and lime, both soft and sharp, and a mild apricot jam later. The peat smoke is strong but not overwhelming, and it's accented by wood smoke and some salty notes of the sea, a mild medicinal iodine as well. We found mineral water and some baking notes of dry vanilla and wildflower honey and malty grain, and as it opened up, a sort of earthy-umami layer blossomed.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium-heavy peat level to go with the medium mouthfeel, and while plentiful in a variety of flavors, this feels slightly softer than the standard PC 10 with a cooling feeling on the cheeks. Those farmyard notes stick around: lots of hay/straw and buttery oil, along with wet wood and mild tannins. Sweet, bright tones of lemon, lime sherbet, and Riesling are juxtaposed by blackberry ham, burnt orange rind, and savory dry rub barbecue; it's jammy, but with kick from white pepper and roundness from vanilla and brown sugar.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long finish, with medium-level sweet peat and some biting white pepper. There's sweetness of vanilla bean and lime sherbet again, or maybe orange sherbet; still, this isn't overly sweet, with drying oak and a mild char note, along with dry grass at the end.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: A nice whisky to compare with the standard Port Charlotte 10 year - this is softer and a little more intricate, with several layers of flavor hidden behind the usual strong peat smoke. The longer this was allowed to open up in the glass, the nicer and rounder it became, with the sweeter sherbety notes especially coming to the forefront.

Review #98 - Springbank 10 Year Local Barley,51,14t9ov5,https://i.redd.it/37nbdlqz4kab1.jpg,1688742026,,"[{'body': ""**Review #98 - Springbank 10 Year Local Barley**\r  \n\r  \n*'Local Barley' Series: Part 4 of 5*\r  \n\r  \nYep, had to stick a Springbank in this series - today, we have the Local Barley bottling released in 2022, the 10 year old with 100% ex-bourbon maturation. It was made using Belgravia barley grown on Glencraigs farm, and we have a 2011 vintage for the spirit.\r  \n\r  \nSpringbank has been doing these Local Barley releases (sporadically) for a long time, but the fervor around them has gained a lot of steam in the last five years. As far as we could surmise, the first Local Barley release was actually bottled back in 1988, a 20 year old whisky with a 1967 vintage, though it was soon followed up by several 24 year old bottlings with a 1966 vintage, released through 1990.\r  \n\r  \n**Springbank 10 Year Local Barley**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Campbeltown - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 165\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 185\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 51.6% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: 100% Ex-bourbon casks\r  \n**Details**: No color added, not chill filtered; Belgravia barley grown on Glencraigs Farm (Kintyre Peninsula), distilled May 2011, bottled December 2021; 15,000 bottle outturn\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 4 months; bottles at 100%, 90% (blind tasting), 70%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Lots of flavors going on here, it's very rich - we'll break it into three rough categories. First, fruits, and tons of them: fizzy and tangy orange, like orange soda, but also a creamy side with lime sherbet and lemon curd. Lemon candies and lemongrass as well - that starts to bridge us into the second category of farmy, funk notes. It's spirity and sparkly, grassy and minty, with some 'dunnage' scents and warm hay layered in. There's a baking spice element to this nose, as well: Mild vanilla and butter, some cola and anise, too. With that cola comes some sassafras and polished oak, a bit of old wood... the peat smoke is soft, with a bit of a cigar humidor vibe, some old leather, too.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Just a hint of umami to start the palate - mushrooms, maybe sauteed. Then it's straight into creamy fruits - greenish yogurt, lemon-lime soda and orange, lots of sharp citrus and pineapple. There's stone fruit and mango as well, some strawberry jam and candies; a bright white wine note on the back end finishes the fruits. Overall, the experience is decently spirity, with lots of old school funk, dirty straw, and some light lactic notes; the mouthfeel is medium-thick, and it's a deep and rich whisky. The dry spirity notes bridge into white pepper and nutmeg, along with more baking elements of cinnamon and vanilla, a hint of licorice if you look for it. Oak influence is mild and dry, with sassafras again and a bit of bitterness at times; the peat smoke is soft on the back end of the palate, adding its influence but not overwhelming - Springbank does that so well.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: More dry and semi-sharp flavors on the finish, with lemon juice and white pepper, some dry vanilla and anise. There's a great tropical melon taste, and the peat tickle takes on a sweeter character. We found cola and old wet wood, some pink peppercorn and lots of green moss. The funky farm notes of damp hay and oil are still lingering, with some dry grass and tobacco leaves as well. It's a medium-long finish, and we end with polished leather shoes.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Lovely, but rare and expensive... what else is there to say about Springbank? Actually, we really enjoyed this one a lot - ex-bourbon cask maturation is our favorite for Springbank, as it really allows the subtleties of the spirit to come through. The farmy notes are there, with lots of bright citrus and tropical fruit complementing the oaky, spicy notes. Highly recommend this if you can find it the suggested retail price, but that's getting pretty tough these days.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 8.4 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #97 - Bruichladdich Islay Barley 2011,45,14rcohv,https://i.redd.it/9ed6ebmgs5ab1.jpg,1688568294,,"[{'body': ""**Review #97 - Bruichladdich Islay Barley 2011**\r  \n\r  \n*'Local Barley' Series: Part 3 of 5*\r  \n\r  \nAfter the heavily peated Octomore spirit, let's switch gears to unpeated distillate, but we'll stay at the same distillery: it's Bruichladdich's Islay Barley range, this one with a 2011 vintage. While this doesn't share the smoke of the Octomore, it does come in with a similar age statement: 6 years, as opposed to 5. Because of that, we likely had some active casks used in the maturation, but hopefully the signature of the special barley will still shine through in the spirit.\r  \n\r  \nLike the Octomore we looked at, this bottle also gives us the specific farms where this barley was grown. For this 2018 bottling, they employed the Coull, Rockside, Island, Mulindry, Starchmill, and Cruach farms, which are scattered around the central and western parts of Islay.\r  \n\r  \n**Bruichladdich Islay Barley 2011**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 80\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 74\r  \n**Age Statement**: 6 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 50% ABV\r  \n**Details**: No color added, not chill filtered; distilled in 2011, bottled in 2018; barley grown at Coull, Rockside, Island, Mulindry, Starchmill, and Cruach farms\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 15 months; bottles at 100%, 60%, 70% (blind tasting), and 50% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Very salty and coastal to start, along with a large helping of earthy notes. There's some malt in there, too, and plenty of spirit notes shining through in this young whisky: it can be crisp, a little bit funky, sort of green and vegetal, with damp green plants and some perfume. Quite a nice variety of fruit, actually, a range from light to dark. Sharper citrus of lemon, lime, and orange, as well as stone fruits of nectarine or peach, but also some prune or dry fig. Despite all of the fruits, this nose is pretty dry, with mild oak and some very light dry vanilla. Interestingly, despite the fact that this was made using unpeated malt, there is a definite smoke note - sort of barbecue char, sort of medicinal - must be some smoke from the barrel char. With more air time, this transitions to icing sugar, some leather, even a hint of white chocolate.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The palate has a medium-thick mouthfeel, there's definitely some lingering oiliness and the flavors are immediately rich and sharp. It's slightly warm and raw, and there is lots of hot cinnamon, zesty orange, dry (bordering bitter) oak, quite spicy overall. Later on, a major jalapeno/hot pepper note develops, and there's some more of that wood char adding to the dryness. Despite all of the dry notes, there is some fruit here, too: white grape and sour green apple, maybe a bit of white stone fruit as well, but generally light and tart. There's an earthy, salty side to this as well, with some green vegetation and hay, and tobacco smoke later; at the end, we do get a hint of sweeter vanilla, along with perfume and wax.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is medium length, maybe medium-long. It's a bit raw - definitely some heat here, it's oily and young and spicy... that hot pepper note from the palate sticks around. Wood smoke tickles the cheeks, and there is a light astringency or tannin, but soft sweet notes of butterscotch and dark chocolate are sprinkled in, some vanilla and hard candy, too. Still, we would say this leans dry, generally, and we end with light nuttiness and a bit of a grainy taste.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Well, this one doesn't mess around - it punches above its 50% ABV strength, quite spicy and sharp in places, though there is a subtle sweetness to combat it. The youth does come through a bit more in this whisky, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing; the lighter cask regimen does allow the distillate to shine through, and it's full of character, as Bruichladdich usually is. A good whisky if this is your style, and pricing hasn't gone crazy yet, so value is above average, as well.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.6 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\r  \n\r  \n**Value Rating**: 7.14\r  \n\r  \nInterested in more?

Review #96 - Bruichladdich Octomore 12.3,96,14n26fp,https://i.redd.it/cr4kn3rf269b1.jpg,1688135808,,"[{'body': ""**Review #96 - Bruichladdich Octomore 12.3**\r  \n\r  \n*'Local Barley' Series: Part 2 of 5*\r  \n\r  \nPart two of our series, and we're sticking around Islay for now, but sneaking over to Bruichladdich - we have their heavily peated Octomore single malt, specifically the 12.3 edition. These '.3' editions use a separate type of barley when compared to the '.1' and '.2' releases - they employ Islay barley-grown specifically. The 12.3, released in 2021, was made using Concerto variety barley from the Octomore Farm on Islay... they even give us the field in which it grew: Church Field, in this case. While the 12.1 and 12.2 Octomores were made using barley peated to a phenol level of 129.7 ppm, this 12.3 was peated to a 'mere' 118.1 ppm.\r  \n\r  \nCasks will vary each year with the '.3' releases - this 2021 bottle employed ex-bourbon casks and ex-Pedro Ximenez casks, in a 75%/25% ratio. The sherry casks are, in fact, Solera casks, a much more rare (and MUCH more expensive) type of sherry cask; instead of new oak seasoned with young, mediocre quality sherry made specifically to prepare the barrels for future whisky agingm which is the case for the majority of ex-sherry casks used in Scotland, 'Solera' casks are usually the actual barrels that were used in maturing high-quality sherries for long periods of time in a Solera system. These barrels are generally quite old and valuable, as the bodegas are not keen to give them up after preparing them for such a long time to properly age high-quality sherry.\r  \n\r  \nEach time we tasted this whisky, we found different flavors to explore, which led to a pretty lengthy list of tasting notes, something you'll see below. There were many layers to this - it continues to astound us that so much complexity can be found in whisky that's merely five years old. The cask strength bottling policy and lack of chill filtration definitely contributes to that, but Bruichladdich also seems to source very high quality casks. There is likely a high proportion of first-fill casks being used for Octomore as well, so that the wood and its previous contents are able to have an immediate and dramatic effect on the powerfully peated Octomore spirit.\r  \n\r  \n**Bruichladdich Octomore 12.3**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 260\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 320\r  \n**Age Statement**: 5 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 62.1% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: 75% Ex-bourbon casks, 25% PX Solera casks from Bodega Fernando de Castilla\r  \n**Details**: 118.1 ppm peat level; Concerto barley variety grown in Church Field on Octomore Farm on Islay; not chill filtered, no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 8 months; bottles at 100%, 90%, and 80% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: This is pulling us in a lot of different directions - very densely flavored, though it isn't closed up, it comes right out at you. Umami notes are the first out of the gate: prosciutto, almost a charcuterie board of meats. They quickly make way for fruit, though; we get the whole spectrum from light to dark, starting with moldy citrus and orange, but moving to sweet raspberry, tons of plum, and darker sherry notes. There's dried fruit, too, like fig and prune. Then we're into baking notes: pretzels and cooked pasta noodles, rich vanilla bean ice cream, butterscotch and white pepper, along with quite a nice malty note. The peat smoke does come through, but it's a medium influence, not the heavy peat you might expect with an Octomore; in our experience, the smoke doesn't always present as strongly on the nose of the Octomores in general. The character of the smoke is like that of a mezcal at times, or some burning hay.\r  \n\r  \nOpposite the fruit, baking spice, and smoke, there is another side to this nose: the woody, farmy notes. There is a medium oak influence despite the young age, and it has some cedar or pine character, a bit like smelling freshly cut wood in a lumberyard. This transitions toward a mulchy character, or more musty and mossy oak, like spending time in a damp cellar. There are green plants, mud, some dried grass, and those nice 'farmyard' funk flavors in here... it's powerful with some sharper spirit as well, with a lingering note of rubber cement.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A very thick, viscous mouthfeel, so cozy-warm and powerful and pungent. While there is a hint of savory still here, in the form of a dry rub barbecue, the emphasis of the palate is more focused on strong smoke and fruits. While strong, the peat is also pleasant, a bit like tobacco or a cigar smoke, or a campfire on a damp evening. There's some nice red wine sort of influence, figs and prune and ripe plum, but also some lighter lemon citrus and fruit sugars. The oak does contribute some tannins, but also baking spices of black pepper and vanilla, as well as some mild salt and a sugary glaze.\r  \n\r  \nDespite the wide array of flavors, this manages to stay well-balanced, and the flavor shows no sign of fading any time soon. Like the nose, with more time, mulchy and earthy notes come in, lots of oils and a spritely spirit brightness, followed up by more rubber.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is very long, with richness, restrained warmth, and creamy texture. It's oily, almost like a cooking oil, and the peat smoke is now constant and prickly, and it's aided by a hint of wood smoke as well. Speaking of wood, the oaky tones are damp and oily as well, and there is a nice 'ground espresso bean' taste, which transitions into dark chocolate. There's charred orange rind, and the wine influence is more mild now, but still gives us a bit of a barbecue taste when paired with the smoke. There's a hint of grain on the back end of the finish, with green hay; it's a pretty dirty whisky overall, which is emphasized at the end.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: We could spend an hour just nosing this whisky, it just gives and gives and gives. So many layers, so many individual and unique notes in different tastings, it really is hard to find another bottle to compare it to. It has the full range - fruits, baking notes, oak, smoke, and Bruichladdich's very unique spirit character. The question is - is that worth $250 to $300? Well, this won't be winning any value contests, but it does deliver a ton a flavor. If you're looking to splurge on a nicer whisky in that price range, and you enjoy heavily peated, powerfully flavored malts, this one could be for you.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 8.7 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #95 - Kilchoman 100% Islay 11th Edition (2021),25,14lbzz6,https://i.redd.it/flcdtis1yr8b1.jpg,1687964827,,"[{'body': ""**Review #95 - Kilchoman 100% Islay 11th Edition (2021)**\r  \n\r  \n*'Local Barley' Series: Part 1 of 5*\r  \n\r  \nIslay Barley, Local Barley... you get the general idea. These are single malts that specifically point out the provenance of their barley, disclosing the location it was grown (near the distillery) and often also providing information on the variety of barley used.\r  \n\r  \nOur first entry in the series is from Islay, from Kilchoman - it's the 100% Islay, an annual release using Islay-grown barley varieties. We're looking at the 11th edition of this whisky today, which was released in 2021, an outturn consisting of 12,000 bottles for the world. Limited, surely, but there's definitely a decent amount of this stuff out there. Kilchoman also tells us that the barley varieties used in this batch were Optic and Publican grown on the distillery's farm, and as always with this brand, the release comes with quality specs: >46% ABV (50% in this case), no added color, and no chill filtration.\r  \n\r  \n**Kilchoman 100% Islay 11th Edition (2021)**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Islay - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 115\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 50% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon barrels and ex-Oloroso butts\r  \n**Details**: 11th Edition; 12,000 bottle release; not chill filtered, no color added; Optic and Publican barley varieties\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 3 months; bottles at 90% and 10% fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Starts out with hay and a bit of funk - it's musty, and the peat is quite earthy. There's salt, too, and with time, the brine becomes more medicinal. Fruits creep in: sweet moldy lemons, peach cobbler and other stone fruits, along with some additional sweetness from vanilla. The funky notes are quite strong now: a damp cellar, very musty, charred wood or the wet remains of a campfire. There are whiffs of white mushrooms and oils, too.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium or so in thickness, and this is rich and powerful, spicy and earthy and peaty, sort of strange. The smoke is sharp, but it's balanced by sweet notes of lime and moldy lemons, some white chocolate and a bit of vanilla sugar. A bit of char or wood smoke and some burnt orange rind creep through, too, and then the earthy, dirty flavors from the nose are back: damp hay, mud, a bit of barbecue as well. Warmth builds in the throat, part peat and part oak... this pulls us in many directions, but it manages to stay somewhat cohesive at the same time.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The peat becomes milder but it does linger a while, it's a medium length finish. More food notes as this evaporates away: orange chicken, melted butter and oil, sweet limes, a bit of cilantro, too. There's a cozy campfire warmth paired with the smoke, and, as was the case throughout the experience, those musty, damp earth and hay tastes linger.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Interesting stuff - is it just the knowledge that this is a sort of 'local barley' whisky that helps the farmyard notes of hay and earth come out in our tastings? Or is there really that much of a difference in the molecular compounds that affect the taste based on the provenance of the barley? Impossible for us to say, but we really enjoyed this Kilchoman. Funk and earth paired with peat is an entertaining combination to explore, and the predominantly ex-bourbon aging allows those underlying spirit characteristics to shine through.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 8.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #94 - Oban 10 Year - Diageo Special Release 2022,14,14h0t4j,https://i.redd.it/sny1rwi57s7b1.jpg,1687532427,,"[{'body': ""**Review #94 - Oban 10 Year - Diageo Special Release 2022**\r  \n\r  \n*10 Year Highlander Series: Part 4 of 4*\r  \n\r  \nOur last 10 year Highlander for the time being, and we're back to the mainland, to the West coast - it's Oban, specifically Diageo's special release from 2022. It was aged for 10 years in a combination of new American oak, refill American oak, and Amontillado sherry-seasoned casks.\r  \n\r  \nWhen we came across this last year, we were a little bit divided on whether or not to purchase it. A Diageo special release? Famous for being overpriced with very mixed quality, which isn't something we would generally go for. But a malt from Oban, presented at cask strength? Well, that's definitely up our alley. We debated for a few weeks, but ended up pulling the trigger.\r  \n\r  \n**Oban 10 Year - Diageo Special Release 2022**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 105\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 130\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 57.1% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: New and refill American oak, Amontillado sherry casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 5 times over 5 months; bottles at 100%, 90%, 80%, 70% (blind tasting), and 60% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: A bit dense, hot, and closed up at first - it takes some time to open up. Then it's rich and so juicy fruity that it's ridiculous; mango, ripe peach and nectarine, orange, plum and prune, and a TON of bubblegum, some syrupy stone fruits as well. Lots of sweet cream and peppermint candy as well, some spearmint, vanilla bean, icing sugar and some sickly sweet perfume all add to the saccharine tones. The oak influence is mild and slightly dry, a bit of white pepper and some richer charred oak and just hint of old polished furniture wood. In one tasting we found baking notes: dark brown sugar and some shortbread, a bit of honey in there, too. In another tasting, we found more classic Highland whisky notes like heather and dried grass, some hay and effervescence. There's the occasional funk, and it's an oversweet affair as a whole.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Mouthfeel is medium-thick; strong perfume and wine gums, lots of hard fruit creme candy and bubblegum and baking spices of brown sugar, white pepper, and honey. It's pretty unique and can be a bit overpowering with its boldness and almost artificially punchy flavors, but there are plenty more layers to explore. Fruity flavors of rum-soaked pineapple, apples, peaches, and stone fruit waft in, and then we get a very strong flowery note, along with mint, candy canes, and fizzy cotton candy, almost like a rye cask finish. We did occasionally find some nice aged whisky notes of syrupy oak and furniture polish, but there was also some spirit influence there, sharp and with barley sugar. We end with even more sweet flavors: molasses, lots of vanilla, butterscotch, buttered rum, and pancakes.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long, and some heat and oiliness from the bottling strength is hanging around. The coastal Highland character finally starts to creep out now: floral and soft tickling oak, a whiff of sea salt, honey and vanilla. There's a certain cinnamon and clove spice from the oak, but we're quickly back to sugar notes: sugar cane, peppermint, and some simple syrup are all here. There's a bit of fizz again, and we end with a mild chemical aftertaste.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Quite unique and potent, but it can come across as slightly artificial. Can't say it lacks flavor, but is it always good flavor? The cask influence is very heavy, and this is hardly recognizable as Oban distillate due to the layers of sickly sweet fruits and bubblegum/cotton candy. So... points for individuality, but not for subtlety. If you're a fan of cask-forward whiskies, you may rate this a bit higher than us. As for value - it's often the trick with Diageo products, and especially with the annual special releases, because the pricing is already high, and only getting higher. We picked this up for just over $100, and we probably wouldn't pay that again for it; now, for us to buy it locally, asking price is closer to $130.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.4 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #93 - Arran 10 Year,48,14f99xm,https://i.redd.it/a1r1uo91td7b1.jpg,1687357805,,"[{'body': ""**Review #93 - Arran 10 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*10 Year Highlander Series: Part 3 of 4*\r  \n\r  \nFrom the Lochranza Distillery we have our next 10 year old Highlander, Arran 10. Another islander, in fact, this distillery is located on the Isle of Arran, sandwiched between Campbeltown and the larger portions of the Scottish mainland. While Lochranza has generally produced whisky with no meaningful amount of peat, they have also distilled peated whisky in small quantities, which is sold under the Machrie Moor label. In recent years, to keep up with demand and access the strong market for heavily peated whisky, the owners of Lochranza have opened a sister distillery - Lagg - which will focus on more heavily peated malt.\r  \n\r  \nArran 10 Year has garnered quite a bit of acclaim in recent years, launching the Arran brand and the Lochranza distillery into the spotlight. Just one example: in the last 2 years, Arran 10 won 'Best Entry Level Single Malt' in both 2021 and 2022, as well as 'Best Single Malt Scotch Whisky' in 2021 at the Online Scotch Whisky Awards, or OSWAs. Enthusiast-driven awards like this reflect the brand's commitment to quality and flavor, as opposed to marketing fluff and luxury pricing.\r  \n\r  \n**Arran 10 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 71\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 71\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 2 months; bottles at 100%, 70%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: It's crisp and bright and a bit spirit forward: lots of sharper fruits of peach, dry nectarine, pineapple, and candied peach rings. There is some light, dry oak, and it adds some creamy coconut and toasted coconut notes, along with a bit of pine sap. Next we take a tropical turn: melon, a sort of lime sherbet sparkle, rum cake, and exotic orange... the ripe fruits just keep coming! White grape and pear, too, layered with some hay and mild honey. We end with a few more typical ex-bourbon notes: light nuttiness, a hint of sharp pepper, along with mild vanilla and icing sugar.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium; it's buttery and creamy, with lots of butterscotch, cinnamon, and some white pepper from the oak, which is generally dry. While the palate is generally a little more dry than the nose, the star here is still sweet, tropical fruit: loads of pineapple and peach ring candies, some unripe banana, some nectarine, just stone fruit in general. We get even lighter, brighter spirit and some floral notes, along with sweet lemon candies (not sour); the sugary notes come in again toward the back of the palate, with rum and sugary syrup, some brown sugar, and baking spices of dry vanilla and clove.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: It's a medium length finish, nice and round and somewhat soft, but not lacking flavor. There are still fruits of peach and pineapple, but we add cantaloupe to the mix now, along with some butter and mineral water. There are more oak notes on this finish: some nuttiness again, light brown sugar and white pepper, and the wood is generally a bit dry and light in color.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Simply lovely. We were a little late to the game trying this one, just snagging a bottle six to eight months ago, after the whisky had already won a number of awards and gained quite a bit of hype. For us, it's easy to see why - great quality, good presentation, reasonably priced (although that bit is climbing in our area, probably off the back of the hype). This can be an easy-sipping whisky when that's what you want, but it also has layers you can dig into with more time and effort.

Review #92 - Glenmorangie 10 Year The Original,34,14az77r,https://i.redd.it/xd60fylkae6b1.jpg,1686927844,,"[{'body': 'In my opinion one of the whiskys with the best price/performance ratio', 'score': 15}, {'body': ""**Review #92 - Glenmorangie 10 Year The Original**\r  \n\r  \n*10 Year Highlander Series: Part 2 of 4*\r  \n\r  \nA no-frills, straightforward, widely available and reasonably priced Highland 10 year old whisky - this is the second of our series, The Original from Glenmorangie. From one of the most popular distilleries in Scotland, one that has been an entry point into this category of spirits for a huge number of whisky fans, this is their entry level offering, a 10 year old with exclusive bourbon cask maturation.\r  \n\r  \nGlenmorangie shares an ownership party with Ardbeg - Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy. They also share the man behind the brand: Dr. Bill Lumsden, Glenmorangie's head of distilling & whisky creation. He's credited as one of the pioneers of wood experimentation in whisky aging, and has been managing Glenmorangie for nearly 3 decades. While this whisky doesn't have any exotic maturation, it will surely still hold his fingerprint due to its barrel selection.\r  \n\r  \n**Glenmorangie 10 Year The Original**\r  \n\r  \n*Scotland/Highlands - Single Malt*\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 33\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: 100% Ex-bourbon casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 15 months; bottles at 50%, 100%, 50% (blind tasting), and 20% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Mellow and a bit simple starting out, slightly oaky, clearly leaning into those ex-bourbon cask flavors of soft oak, cinnamon, pears, dry vanilla, and other baking notes like clove and maple syrup. The spirit and grain influence is there, with oats and oatmeal, honey, a hint of youth as well... then we get more fruits of grape jam, orange peel, maybe even a mild grape candy. With more time, this opens up and becomes sweeter, and there's the tiniest whiff of smoke on the back end, maybe a wood smoke. Overall, somewhat light and inoffensive.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium-thin; there is the actually a little more oiliness than expected, and a bit more oaky spice: cinnamon, clove, honey, and vanilla bean all come in waves, and the spirit character is stronger and cleaner now, but still comes across a bit young and warm with solid grain and oat flavors. One time we got a whiff of tobacco smoke, and on another, it was more of a slightly burnt French bread crust; past some wood spice and wood sugars, it's sweeter overall, and we end with a hint of cream.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: It's a medium-short finish, casual warmth and spirit notes coming across with dusty grain and oats, along with some lemon oil. Oak presence is pretty muted, and this whole experience turns a bit drier with dry vanilla (or some vanilla extract later), a hint of cloves and white pepper, but it ends with a smoother honey note.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: We tried to give this some time, but we're struggling to connect. It isn't a bad or seriously flawed whisky, it's just... okay. The flavors are relatively plain, and the lower strength and likely chill filtering dampen the experience a bit further. Value is actually alright just because this bottle is so cheap, but if you've passed the beginning of your Scotch journey, this bottle might have diminishing returns.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 5.4 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #91 - Talisker 10 Year,73,149hinm,https://i.redd.it/hsxi60shh16b1.jpg,1686772815,,"[{'body': '**Review #91 - Talisker 10 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*10 Year Highlander Series: Part 1 of 4*\r  \n\r  \nYes, yes - many people would consider this an ""Island\' single malt, as opposed to a part of the possibly outdated SWA regulated \'Highlands\' region. We needed a couple more 10 years to make a series, though, so we lumped in the island malts with them. Regions are a bit outdated as a whole, anyways - there are distilleries in every corner of Scotland producing every style of single malt, so let\'s not take the borders too seriously.\r  \n\r  \nTalisker uses a medium peat level in their whiskies - around 20 ppm, though you\'ll find slightly varying levels according to different sources. Because of that amount of peat smoking, there should be a definite smoky characteristic in this malt, although it shouldn\'t overwhelm the other flavors. Being a mass-produced 10 year old, there is likely a significant portion of ex-bourbon cask aging here, too, so we\'ll look for baking spices and maybe some Highland heathery elements, along with a bit of the salt that this supposed to carry after it\'s \'made by the sea.\'\r  \n\r  \n**Talisker 10 Year**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Highlands - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 70\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 45.8% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 6 months; bottles at 40% and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: There\'s definitely some peat in here, not to strong, but also not too soft - it\'s sort of mild and musty, but it grows stronger with time. We do find a bit of truth in that \'made by the sea\' reputation, at least on the nose: it\'s a bit briny, there\'s some sea salt here, almost a sandy beach, along with minerality. There\'s a tiny hint of a meaty note in here - maybe reminiscent of the worm tubs used in the production process? Then we move to fruit, mostly citrus of orange and lemon drops. The oak is mild, and we end with hard candy and some mild black pepper.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium, and it\'s oily and salty, a nice brine note. Peat is a little more green now, but there\'s also this underlying synthetic sort of wood smoke (think theatre smoke machine, sort of a sweet and chemically smoke). The orange and lemon citrus fruits are back, generally sweet, but there\'s also an interesting watermelon note, at least in one of our tastings. With more time, it gets more buttery and heathery, and that mild meaty note returns - dry rub barbecue, this time.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is medium-long, in part due to that lingering peat, which is the longest-lasting flavor. There are others, though - more sweet fruits of lemon and orange citrus, some sharper wood smoke, a mild grassy note, and a very mild meatiness. All through the experience, the oak influence has been very mild, almost not even there.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Nice, nothing special, but nice... possibly leaning a bit sweet for our tastes. The spirit is solid, but it\'s not particularly complex, although the savory note is nicely layered in there.

Review #90 - Edradour 10 Year,40,1457lt2,https://i.redd.it/1j4nbiqlb05b1.jpg,1686322919,,"[{'body': ""**Review #90 - Edradour 10 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*'Meaty' Whisky Mini-Series: Part 3 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nTo wrap our series, we're looking at one of the smallest distilleries in Scotland: Edradour. While their core range is relatively small, you can still find their bottles in a variety of places, and their most common whisky is probably this - the 10 year.\r  \n\r  \nOwned by the independent bottler Signatory Vintage, Edradour is located in Perthshire, in the southern Highlands, not far from the south end of Speyside. Producing about 200,000 LPA currently (up from 95k-100k just a few years ago), the distillery creates mostly unpeated whisky, although a small amount is peated and sold under the brand Ballechin. Ballechin is aged in sherry casks, as well - an interesting comparison might be between the peated and unpeated varieties from the same distillery at the same age... another time, maybe.\r  \n\r  \n**Edradour 10 Year**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Highlands - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 81\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 81\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: First and second fill ex-Oloroso casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 5 times over 5 months; bottles at 90%, 100%, 80% (blind tasting), 60% (blind tasting), and 50% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: We do start off with some savory flavors - meaty, a sort of charred pulled pork, or even some smoked salmon, but this nose quickly dives straight into lots of fruit notes. So many different red and purple fruits across our tastings: fig, seedy raisins, prunes and pomegranate; there are raspberries and strawberries, it's juicy and stewed fruit as well; later, we transition to cocktail cherries and orange zest, rhubarb pie and cherry soda. With more air time, it becomes slightly darker, sparkling grape juice bordering on cough medicine. There are some baking notes here, like candied pecans and baked bread, but also spices of cinnamon and vanilla... darker notes of caramel and milk chocolate come later. Though it isn't too old, we do find some wood spice and leather, but some spirit character is also still present, like minerality and some straw; overall, it's rich, dark, and balanced between sweet and dry.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Not too much savory stuff on the palate, it's really a fruit and baking spice experience again. The fruit is even darker now: grape, raisin, dark cherry, blackberry, some inky mulled wine. There are a few tart fruits like cranberry and orange, even an amaro note, but the experience is generally sweeter. So many baked goods - lots of nutty spice, with cardamom, clove, and cinnamon to accent it; chocolate, both milk and dark; some bready tastes, but also sweetness from brown sugar, as well as sharper stuff like licorice and black pepper. There are some really nice oaky tones, like wood sugar and coffee, and we find a sweet cigar smoke once it's opened up further... mild tannins and salt add some balance here. A medium mouthfeel, sometimes slightly watery, and overall, this is a great dram for a winter night - it's cozy, and we end with a sort of vermouth or cocktail note.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is medium length, both tangy and jammy, with more stewed fruits of prune and raspberry, some orange and cherry preserve. Lots of 'Christmas spice' elements, too: that cardamom and nutmeg is back, some dusty cocoa powder and molasses, but also lighter notes of vanilla and shortbread. A really nice coffee note from the palate continues into the finish, and some dry oak is contributing to the cozy, mildly warm vibe at the very end.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: What a dark, juicy blast of flavor. It would be nice if this was presented at a higher ABV, of course, but the lower strength doesn't impact the experience too much other than a slightly lackluster mouthfeel. We probably found the largest variety of fruits in this whisky that we've found in any so far, and while many are in the same vein (dark berries, dried fruit, etc.), there is enough nuance to keep it very interesting, and we come back to the bottle often. Value here is decent for the flavor you get, although $80+ for a 10 year old whisky feels like it's getting slightly expensive...\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.5 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #89 - Mortlach 12 Year,26,143eryw,https://i.redd.it/850lv39yvl4b1.jpg,1686148164,,"[{'body': ""**Review #89 - Mortlach 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*'Meaty' Whisky Mini-Series: Part 2 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nOur second 'meaty' whisky is Mortlach 12, out of the Speyside region - Dufftown, specifically. Mortlach, owned by Diageo, is renowned for the character of its spirit - just the sort of thing we're looking for, with those savory notes that arrive before the spirit even enters the barrel.\r  \n\r  \nMortlach uses a more unusual distillation process, yielding a spirit that is 2.81 times distilled, as opposed to the usual 2 times used in pot distillation in Scotch whisky. Part of this process involves the famous 'Wee Witchie,' the smallest, yet most important, pot still (a spirit still, as opposed to a wash still) in the distillery - the 12 year expression has taken the nickname in honor of this still. Of course, as is expected for this series, some condensation of the spirit vapors is done via a worm tub, and there is some sherry cask aging involved, so we're looking for a slightly dirtier, fruitier dram.\r  \n\r  \n**Mortlach 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Speyside - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 59\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 59\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43.4% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 8 months; bottles at 100%, 80%, 60% (blind tasting), and 50% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: A bit unusual, it's slightly metallic and savory, with some serious spirit influence, almost to the point of being slightly chemical. Sometimes we found a vegetal note as well, almost bordering on root vegetables, but also damp and rotting wood, mossy stones, and old polished furniture wood. In terms of fruit: dry prune, raisin, and fig, but also a hint of oily citrus and bright exotic fruits. The bourbon casks are adding brown sugar, wood sugar, some dry vanilla, and cinnamon... even ginger and coconut, as well. We end with some darker notes of cola and chocolate-covered acai berry.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium-thin, and it comes with more of those weird, interesting flavors: funky, savory, sulfury dried meats, or even an old, re-heated meat flavor. It's still pretty spirity, too, but that soon gives way to rich fig and smoked orange rind, prune and cola, chocolate and tobacco smoke. There are some earthy and nature-like notes here: dirt and tone, maybe a bit of a farmyard hay, a hint of grain, and some effervescent herbal spice, almost eucalyptus. After a tickle of licorice and pepper, along with some lemon juice, we end with spiced oak and a hint of polished leather.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: It's a medium length finish which is full of orange and baking spice: orange candies, cinnamon, dry vanilla, brown sugar, and barley sugar. Those worm tubs are showing some character here, too: lingering oil and a mild sulfur, some old damp wood tones, a hint of bitterness as well. With a bit more air time, more spirit notes trickle into the finish, along with a bit of bell pepper; we end with hints of cola, or even root beer.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Interesting, if a bit neutered. There's some nice character to this spirit, the worm tubs and sherry aging really do shine, although the ABV is low, and the likely use of chill filtration keeps everything a bit more reserved... we think this could really shine with better presentation. Value on this 12 year bottle is decent for the interesting taste you get, but we're wary that anything with a higher age statement (or any of the annual special releases from Diageo) might see that value erode quite quickly.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Average Rating**: 7.1 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\r  \n\r  \n**Value Rating**: 7.32\r  \n\r  \nInterested in more?

This OB mutes Mortlach's uniqueness, for me, sanding down the more unusual edges and leaving a perfectly fine but not highly memorable dram.\n\nIf it weren't Mortlach –\xa0if it were just some Glen Onymous spirit – I'd say it's a good $50 bottle to give as a gift to someone whose tastes you don't know very well.\n\nAs it's Mortlach, one of my very favorite distilleries ever, it's hard not to be a bit disappointed. I never had the Rare Old, though; Diageo's previous attempt a regular OB Mortlach was a $100 NAS bottle that made many connoisseurs incandescently angry at what an overpriced, crappy bottle they released under the name.

Review #88 - Craigellachie 13 Year,74,13ye63y,https://i.redd.it/z09rkbu76m3b1.jpg,1685715753,,"[{'body': '**Review #88 - Craigellachie 13 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*\'Meaty\' Whisky Mini-Series: Part 1 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThis little series has more of a subjective determining factor, although a lot of the community will probably agree that these three whiskies meet the criteria: \'meaty\' flavors in the whisky. Each will differ a little bit, but we\'re looking for some sort of unusual umami note, something more rich and characterful.\r  \n\r  \nThere are a couple of production factors that tend to add this meaty characteristic: the use of worm tub condensers during the distillation process, as well as the use of sherry casks for aging. Neither of these is a requirement for a savory whisky, but they can definitely amplify that effect, or at least make it more likely. All three of the whiskies we\'ll look at employ worm tub condensation on at least some of the spirit, as well as sherry cask aging to some degree.\r  \n\r  \nFor those who aren\'t familiar, worm tub condensers are a piece of equipment used to cool the spirit vapors after they are heated to separate them in the pot stills. These used to be a more common, or standard, way of condensing spirit in the Scotch industry, but now the majority of distilleries use shell-and-tube condensers, which are much more efficient. Here\'s a picture of one of the condensers, in use at Edradour distillery (a whisky we\'ll look at later in this series):\r  \n\r  \nhttps://scotchwhisky.com/magazine/ask-the-professor/6549/how-do-worm-tubs-create-sulphur-notes/\r  \n\r  \nCraigellachie even goes into some of these details on the back label of this 13 year old whisky. According to the brand, ""A worm tub is a long copper tube, sitting in a large tank of cold water, which snakes back and forth and gradually gets narrower. In 1891 many distilleries condensed their spirit this way, giving their whiskies a distinctive, meaty character.""\r  \n\r  \n**Craigellachie 13 Year**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Speyside - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 48\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 52\r  \n**Age Statement**: 13 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: First fill and refill ex-bourbon, first fill and refill ex-sherry casks\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 1 month; bottles at 90%, 70%, and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Nice nose, dirty and lightly funky, a little bit musty. There is that sort of umami note we\'re looking for: it\'s a bit light, almost metallic, sort of an exotic meat scent. There\'s a lot of grape and purple fruit in here, like juicy prunes, bitter prune, and some other mild stewed sherry fruit, along with the occasional whiff of orange. There\'s a lot of character to this spirit - it\'s retained the spirit notes with a moderate cask influence, and comes across as a very old-school style whisky. With more time, we\'re finding light malty notes, some buttered pastry, dusty chocolate, and a hint of grain; even later, we have dry wood and some leather. The whole nose is a bit reserved, but packs good, interesting flavors.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Dirty, seriously a bit filthy in some tastings. A medium mouthfeel with some mild bitter spirit, grain, and that meaty metallic umami note again, though it\'s a little more mild now, sort of like a dry roasted white meat. The area that has picked up a lot is baking spice: cardamom, clove, cinnamon, brown sugar, and some other brown spice are packed in, along with a distinct fatty nuttiness, an almond or hazelnut. In terms of fruit, it\'s more reserved, but there is some charred orange, dry fig, and maybe a bit of lemon pith; we end with a hint of wood smoke and maybe a mild sulphur.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is medium length, quite a bit of orange, nuttiness, and some dirtier tones like sulphur, umami, and European oak spice. A little more subtle than the palate, you have to dig a bit, but you can find lots more: mildly sour malt, some lemon zest, brown sugar, cocktail bitters, and some vanilla; some mild soft prune, and bit of oak, too. The whole thing is now rounded and a bit buttery.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Very solid whisky, this is good stuff. It\'s definitely a bit more unusual compared to some of the other malts that have \'entry level\' pricing - that unique umami flavor is definitely there, and it\'s interesting to explore. The value here is excellent - for a solidly complex tasting experience, $50 is a great price these days. Definitely a recommendation to buy if you\'re interested in the sherried/meaty flavor profile.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.5 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn\'t even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don\'t buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn\'t use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we\'ve tasted\r  \n10 - Can\'t imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we\'ve added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Another one of the bestselling whisky brands, especially in the United States, this is the entry point of a huge number of people into the whisky hobby.\n\nAs this is a Tennessee whisky, it went through the Lincoln County process, which is an additional charcoal filtration step done by steeping the spirit in charcoal chips - in the case of Jack Daniel's, it's specifically sugar maple wood chips. This is supposed to further 'mellow' the flavor of the whisky, which might be great if you're mixing it, but this is already bottled at a low 40% ABV, so flavor may be lacking.\n\n**Jack Daniel's Black Label**\n\nUSA - Tennessee Whisky\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 20\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 40% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 3 months; bottles at 100%, 60%, 30%, and 20% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Boozy dirty bananas, like sickly sweet old mushy bananas; also ripe banana, bananas foster... holy bananas, batman. There's some youth here as well: corn grain, oatmeal, mild herbal notes, slightly chemical and some mild charcoal. There's a bit of toasty oak, not too much, but also some wood flavors like clove, soft white pepper, and a hint of cinnamon. At times it can be a bit creamy, but generally it isn't overly sweet. We finish with banana bread and a bit of cherry hiding in the background... this seriously reeks of banana.\n\n**Palate**: Heavier on the oak on this palate, it's tart and sharp and slightly ashy like charcoal, or even a brittle wood smoke. The mouthfeel is medium-thin, and before we dive into the banana notes, we get some baking notes: vanilla, brown sugar, a baked biscuit, before a seriously grainy young spirit note comes to the front. Alright, let's do the banana stuff: seedy unripe banana, but also mushy banana in the background, a hint of bananas foster rum sauce. We can find that tiny cherry hint again if we're looking for it, and we end with some slightly drier oak, a hint of earthiness, and a mild peanut taste.\n\n**Finish**: The finish is medium length, and past some mild char and slightly sour and spicy oak, it's a lot of banana once again, over-ripe and sweet now. Creamy vanilla and a sort of wheated bourbon note, but then we find some spicier tones of pepper, clove, and even some smoked paprika. We end with fake banana flavoring, like banana-flavored hard candies.\n\n**Final Note**: Well, if you like bananas, you may like this one - that flavor is pretty dominant throughout, but especially on the nose. Past that, there is some evident youth here, and the extra charcoal filtering that makes this a Tennessee whisky leaves a little bit of a mark, as well.

This is one of the biggest gateway whiskies into the world of Scotch - it's often the first one that people taste, due to its widespread availability in every bar, retail store that sells liquor, and many home bars.\r  \n\r  \nAs with most blends, the recipe of this whisky is a guarded secret, although we do have some general ideas of what is inside. Like most Johnnie Walker products, it's a blend of grain and malt whiskies, all at least 12 years old; it's rumored that there is a decent amount of Cardhu, Talisker, and Caol Ila included, though the peat/smoke influence is supposed to be relatively mild.\r  \n\r  \n**Johnnie Walker Black Label**\r  \n\r  \nScotland - Blend\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 33\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 40% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 2 months; bottles at 100% and 50% fill levels at times of review.

There's some maltiness but also a bit of grain spirit, and then a light, sharp smoke begins to waft through, both peat and wood smoke. Overall, it's pretty rounded, and later we get some oaky cinnamon and vanilla.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The palate is a bit thin and watery, but there is some sharp cleaner spirit and a bit more smoke than the nose; that said, the smoke is a sort of strange, synthetic smoke. A number of citrus and orchard fruits: lemon, lime, green apple, or a more sour apple in general, and some pear. From the oak we're getting damp wood, barrel spice, and some sweetness from vanilla and cream; there's some honey as well, ending with white pepper and sugar cookies. It's a mellow, casual sipper overall.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length finish, with milder orchard fruits and wood spice, a bit of black pepper as well. There's a significant sour malt note, though the overall experience leans a bit sweet. Lingering notes of white pepper, smoke, dry oak, and some spirit sharpness.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is alright, maybe a good entry to Scotch whisky because it isn't too bold, and surveys a few different flavor profiles with the mild smoke and some nice light fruits. It's lacking any real complexity or punch, though, and the palate especially comes off a bit weak. As for value, this is alright - it's relatively affordable, but not the cheapest, so its middling score is going to limit how great the value can be.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 5.3 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

With no age statement, no special finishing barrels, and coming in at 43% ABV (86 proof), it's your typical entry level bourbon that's available everywhere, consistent, and reasonably priced.\n\nThis bourbon has a relatively corn-heavy mashbill of 78% corn, 10% rye, and 12% barley, and is generally believed to be aged between 4 and 7 years (it's a minimum of 4 years due to the use of 'Straight' on the label and lack of an age statement). A favorite of many and a popular entry point to the hobby, this whisky has a lot to offer, especially at its very reasonable price - we can pick it up for $11 nearby.\n\n**Evan Williams Black Label**\n\nUSA - Bourbon\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 11\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 43% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 6 months; bottles at 50%, 100%, and 40% fill levels at times of review.

Some lighter tones of citrus and something slightly floral at the beginning, and then we get more brown sugar and caramel, some baking spices in general. Along with a medium amount of semi-dry oak, there's a distinct nuttiness in here, and along with some cherry, we end with a bit of sweet sauce and corn grain.\n\n**Palate**: More balanced between sweet and dry on the palate, and there's some ethanol taste up front - the mouthfeel is medium-thin. Plenty of oak, it's warming and comes with a decent amount of nuttiness again, like salted peanut or even nut butter. The sweetness comes from a little bit of sugar and a sort of low-quality chalky chocolate, and while the cherry note from the nose is still here, it's reduced in effect. There's a bit of vanilla and mild wood smoke before just a tiny hint of tobacco spice finishes the experience.\n\n**Finish**: The finish is medium-short in length, and it's light and a little warm. The flavors have started to trail off at this point, but there are some lingering: fruits of raspberry or sour strawberry; baking notes of cloves, mild pepper, brown sugar, and maple sugar; there's just a hint of peanut again, and we finish with some mild, dry oak.\n\n**Final Note**: This bourbon is alright - we can see it as a decent starting point, a good entry for those not accustomed to higher proof spirits. It's not really offensive in any way, doesn't really take any risks or have complexity, but it does have a few solid, defined flavors that are well developed. The real item of note here is in the price - it has solid flavor development for a very cheap $11 to $15 cost, which puts it firmly in the top tier of value picks.

Not saying prices should be this way, that's just the way it is these days\n* Values that were spit out of the equation at this point were generally between 0 and 2.5, so we multiplied the whole thing by 4 to get a roughly 0 to 10 scale\n\nSo the equation is \\[Value\\] = \\[Score\\] / (\\[Price\\] \\^ (1 / 3)) \\* 4, or 'score divided by the cube root of the price, all multiplied by 4.\n\nWe do a value calculation on each of the individual reviews that we average into our summary review that we post online, so each mini-review will generally have a different score and possibly a different bottle cost if the price has changed; therefore, if you take the equation above and apply it to the score and price listed in our posted review, it might not be exactly the same as the value we give due to rounding and price change, but it should be pretty close.\n\nFor instance, with this review: Value = 4.9 / ($11 \\^ (1/3)) \\* 4 = 8.8130, so about 0.03 off the value we calculated based on the averages of our reviews.\n\nYou could get above a value of 10 with a price low enough and a whisky score high enough, something like:\n\n* a price of $10 and a score of 6/10, which would give us: Value = 6.0 / ($10 \\^ (1/3)) \\* 4 = 11.1398, or\n* a price of $20 and a score of 8/10, which would give us: Value = 8.0 / ($20 \\^ (1/3)) \\* 4 = 11.7889;\n\nIt just isn't very common to find really good bottles at extremely low prices like that."", 'score': 2}, {'body': ""Everyone says that but I've never really enjoyed BiB.

Reviews #83 and #84 - The Power of a Barrel - Comparing Two Single Cask SMWS Clynelish 10 Years,37,13ly0gq,https://i.redd.it/adbsjuruxs0b1.jpg,1684508472,,"[{'body': '**Reviews #83 and #84 - The Power of a Barrel - Comparing Two Single Cask SMWS Clynelish 10 Years**\r  \n\r  \nA fun little experiment for today\'s reviews - we\'re looking at two 10 year old single cask SMWS bottles which were distilled at Clynelish. We want to look at the nuances that separate individual barrels add to a spirit, especially when the spirit has essentially the same specifications other than the singular barrels. How much difference does a unique barrel really create in a whisky?\r  \n\r  \nThe releases have the usual fun SMWS names: \'Afternoon Baking\' and ""Bish. Bash. Bosh!\'\r  \n\r  \nThese two releases ended up being the perfect pick for this experiment, as they are from the same distillery, aged the same amount of time, aged in the same type of cask (first fill ex-bourbon barrels), and come in at very similar strengths (59.5% and 59.1%). In fact, it gets even better - these two single barrels of spirit actually came from the same distillation run, completed on February 8th, 2011, and were released within a month of each other, meaning the maturation time was almost exactly the same. Truly, the only difference between these whiskies is the specific unique staves of oak that comprised their casks.\r  \n\r  \nInterestingly, despite all of these similarities, these two bottles were actually released in different SMWS \'flavor profiles\' - 26.192 (\'Afternoon Baking\') comes from the Juicy, Oak, & Vanilla profile, while 26.194 (\'Bish. Bash. Bosh!\') is from the Sweet, Fruity, & Mellow profile. This seems to imply that we\'re going to see some real flavor differences in our tastings.\r  \n\r  \n**SMWS 26.192 \'Afternoon Baking\' - Clynelish 10 Year;**\r  \n**SMWS 26.194 \'Bish. Bash. Bosh!\' - Clynelish 10 Year**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Highlands - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 135 each\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: No longer available\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 59.5% ABV (Afternoon Baking) and 59.1% ABV (Bish. Bash. Bosh!)\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Both fully matured in first fill ex-bourbon barrels\r  \n**Details (Afternoon Baking)**: 1 of 231 bottles, distilled February 8, 2011\r  \n**Details (Bish. Bash. Bosh!)**: 1 of 186 bottles, distilled February 8, 2011\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: We reviewed each bottle 5 times over the course of about 3 months, sometimes blind, sometimes not blind, and often in direct comparison to each other. The fill levels of the bottles ranged from 100% full to about 70% over the course of the reviews. As always, they were tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes (occasionally a few minutes more). We did sometimes add water, as well\r  \n\r  \n**Nose (26.192 Afternoon Baking)**: True to its name, we start off with lots of baking notes: brown sugar, vanilla bean, sugary cereal notes, and honey come to mind. We have spices, too: nutmeg, cardamom, and peppercorns, along with a bit of bubblegum and some sharper grain. It\'s pretty potent overall, and past the baking elements, we have some mild candle wax and a bit of perfume. There is a little bit of fruit here, too: light tart lemon curd, or a meringue, some mild creamy orchard fruit, and strawberry hard creme candies. The oak is sugary but dry.\r  \n\r  \n**Nose (26.194 Bish. Bash. Bosh!)**: While this shares some of the baking spices on the nose, like cinnamon, strong brown sugar, and a hint of white pepper, this one is definitely more fruit-forward. We get creamy tropical fruit, tart lemon, pineapple, even some berry fruit mixed in. There\'s banana, sherbet, pear, and some peach stone fruit as well. The oak is rich with a hint of polish, and the experience overall is rich and dense, even slightly closed up at times. There\'s a mild spirit note, and we end with some syrupy lemon cake and some flowers.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate (26.192 Afternoon Baking)**: The baking theme is even stronger on the palate; in our tastings, we found lots of vanilla, burnt sugar, butterscotch, and some mild black pepper; there\'s also brown sugar, flour, mint, cardamom, and white pepper. The only real fruit influence is in the form of sherbet, the brightness of which goes hand in hand with the tingly spirit influence, which is pretty punchy when undiluted. The mouthfeel is thick and oily, and with more time, some perfume notes and heather come forward, even wildflower honey. There\'s lots of wood sugar, and it\'s really a saccharine sweet experience overall, syrupy and slightly grainy. We finish up with creme brulee.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate (26.194 Bish. Bash. Bosh!)**: Lovely tropical fruits of pineapple, lemon, orange, and peach ring candies; orchard fruits of juicy pear and tart lemon preserve as well. This one is also pretty rich and warm, with a heavier emphasis on floral and perfume notes, as well as some hay and a bit of mild bubblegum. The baking spices are here, too - sweet vanilla bean, light brown sugar, black and white pepper, and some caramel. We have bits of char and cinnamon from the oak, which is stronger and more drying than the other bottle. The mouthfeel is thick and buttery, and we have some candy notes as well as a lingering pastry flavor.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish (26.192 Afternoon Baking)**: Generally sweet on the finish, with a lot of those same baking and cooking notes: vanilla bean, sweet mint, brown sugar, hot honey, cinnamon, cardamom, and sugar cookies. The oak is plentiful and dry, and lends some perfume and light floral notes as well. There\'s mild bubblegum and some heather, and later, and interesting petrichor note. After some sweeter notes of granular sugar and pear, there is a tart fruity side, with lemon drops and hot peach jam; it\'s a medium-long finish, quite warm.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish (26.194 Bish. Bash. Bosh!)**: A lot of the same fruit we found in the finish of the other bottle - lemon candy, poached pear, and some sweet peach, but we also get tart pineapple and a hint of orange. The baking notes are toned down, with honey and cloying clove, maybe a bit of mild pepper. The interest here is really in the texture and wood notes: it\'s a medium-long finish, floral and strongly perfumed, oily and buttery, too. The oak seems dark and wet, and we finish with some soft flowery wax.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Both of these are pretty tasty, with plenty of flavors to keep you busy in a tasting, but the juicy fruity tones of \'Bish. Bash. Bosh!\' really pulled us in. That bottle felt a bit more refined as well, with a little less sharpness to the alcohol and nicer creamy texture. It has a stronger floral perfume in the finish as well.\r  \n\r  \nWe can see why these two bottles were allocated to separate flavor profiles by the SMWS; there is definitely some overlap, and you can find the distillery character in each of the bottles, but they had their own directions from the casks, heavy on either baking spice or fruit. We\'re happy to have both of them, but we have to give a slight edge in the score to 26.194 \'Bish. Bash. Bosh!\'\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating (26.192 Afternoon Baking)**: 7.6 / 10\r  \n**Average Rating (26.194 Bish. Bash. Bosh!)**: 7.9 / 10', 'score': 6}, {'body': 'Interesting comparison.

Review #82 - Jefferson's Reserve Pritchard Hill Cabernet Cask Finish,56,13k4870,https://i.redd.it/1yijupy5pe0b1.jpg,1684335671,,"[{'body': ""**Review #82 - Jefferson's Reserve Pritchard Hill Cabernet Cask Finish**\n\n*Cabernet Cask Mini-Series: Part 3 of 3*\n\nWe're wrapping this series with a bourbon, this one hailing from Kentucky Artisan Distillery, home of Jefferson's Reserve and Jefferson's Ocean. This is a brand known for being more of a premium whisky, while still being available; the standard Jefferson's reserve is not age stated, but is thought to be around 7-8 years old, so it has some real flavor development. The Ocean side of the brand, which has both bourbon and rye, is famous for the fact that the barrels are aged at sea, adding effort, expense, and unique flavor - the prices seem to match that line of thinking. Are these good value? We'll let you be the judge of that, as it ranges from palate to palate.\n\nThis specific bottle is on the bourbon side, but after the usual new charred oak cask aging, it spends about 12 months in French oak Cabernet Sauvignon casks from the Chappellet Winery in Napa Valley, California. How will the addition of the extra oak aging affect the final flavor? The European oak will likely add some spice, so we could be looking at a more tannic, well-aged experience, but we'll be on the lookout for the red fruit flavors from the wine as well.\n\nOne random note - we don't put much stock in color due to the different types of barrel aging that different products undergo, as well as practices of adding color in some industries like Scotch, but the color of this whisky is absolutely lovely. It's this fantastic shade of red mahogany, very unique when compared to other bourbons, or other whiskies in general. Our picture doesn't do it justice... not even close.\n\n**Jefferson's Reserve Pritchard Hill Cabernet Cask Finish**\n\nUSA - Bourbon\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 69\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 45.1% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: Finished in Cabernet Sauvignon casks from Chappellet Winery\n\n**Details**: Single barrel product\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 5 months; bottles at 100%, 70%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Red wine and red fruit: cherry, or cherry juice, it's semi-sweet and semi-tart, and the complexion is generally dark overall, with some sugary molasses and brown sugar. Lots of your classic bourbon notes here, too: decent amount of oak, rich caramel, vanilla, and just a hint of a sharper tannin as well. Past the sweeter notes, there are actually some more unusual bits here, like mild herbal funk, a hint of earthiness, even a buttered popcorn note. We finish with some sharp orange.\n\n**Palate**: The red wine influence is a bit more heavy handed on the palate: more oak, with some bitter tannins, and a lot of red fruit of under-ripe strawberry and cherry. It's sort of spicy, almost like a Malbec wine, which is dry and heavily spiced in our experience. The palate is more tart and dry than the nose, but there is still light brown sugar, as well as a bit of a syrupy cocktail cherry, or maybe a cherry lozenge. There are trailing herbal and straw notes, some richer molasses, and the mouthfeel is medium.\n\n**Finish**: There's dark cherry, almost a cherry cough medicine here, and some candied orange slices. While the fruit side of this is somewhat mellow, there's definitely a bit of prickly oak and some dry vanilla, even some sawdust. The palate was more dry and sharp, but this finish is turning sweeter once more, with dark brown sugar and round red fruit notes.\n\n**Final Note**: Not bad, but the wine cask maturation here is definitely a bit heavy-handed. If you enjoy your strongly finished whisky, that could be a point in its favor, but we would like a little bit more balance. The finish is a bit short, too; still, there are nice sweet fruit and brown sugar tones that are a good addition to just about any bourbon. Value is okay - that may come down to whether or not this style of whisky is your preference.\n\n**Average Rating**: 6.5 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\n\n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\n\n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\n\n3 - Low end mixing whisky\n\n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\n\n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\n\n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\n\n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\n\n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\n\n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\n\n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #81 - Dalmore Cigar Malt,94,13fnl4q,https://i.redd.it/r57mrckn0fza1.jpg,1683903680,,"[{'body': ""**Review #81 - Dalmore Cigar Malt**\r  \n\r  \n*Cabernet Cask Mini-Series: Part 2 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThe second part of our Cabernet cask series will focus on Dalmore's Cigar Malt, made to be paired with cigars, as you might expect. There are actually a couple of variations on this theme - some distilleries create Cigar batches that are supposed to taste like cigars, while others create Cigar batches that are made to complement the flavors of a cigar. This malt is the latter.\r  \n\r  \nThis bottle had a special place for us originally - it was one of the more expensive bottles we purchased in the first couple of years of our whisky journey, and we waited to pop it open until an anniversary trip last year. After a neat tasting, we also gave it a try with some cigars to get the full experience - those notes will be separately described to show the interaction of the two flavor agents, and how it changed the experience (for us).\r  \n\r  \nAs well as the obligatory Cabernet cask aging for this series, this Dalmore also spent time aging in traditional ex-bourbon casks, as well as Matusalem ex-Oloroso sherry casks, so we're likely to have a somewhat exotic blend of flavors on our hands. Will all of those notes be able to shine through in the end, especially with a bottling strength that's a little lower than we would like for a quality presentation?\r  \n\r  \n**Dalmore Cigar Malt**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Highlands - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 160\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 180\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 44% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon, Matusalem Oloroso sherry, and Cabernet Sauvignon casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 2 months; bottles at 100%, 80% (with cigars), and 60% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Leather and plenty of sherry, it's rich and nutty and full of 'Christmas spice.' Decently fruity overall: some orange, juicy raspberry, some cherry and other sweet red fruit, but also dark dry savory fruit, like juicy prune and fig. There's also some baking spice here, and the whole experience sweetens slightly later; we get vanilla icing, very faint lemon, cinnamon sugar, cardamom, even some peppercorns. In the background, there's a slight bitterness from oak char, some wood smoke, and just a hint of sulfur.\r  \n\r  \n***Nose with cigar****: This turns a bit sweeter, sort of dessert-like. Candied oranges, vanilla, and wood smoke come to mind, along with Aperol and a bit of red fruit.*\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium-thin, but there is just a little bit of heat, which combines with wood tannins and a hint of bitter sulfur to start the palate with a mild kick. There is some baking spice, like vanilla and clove and cardamom, but the star of this palate is fruit-type notes: sherry, sweet red wine, cherry, raspberry, and grape all come to mind. It turns darker and drier with raisin, fig, and prune later. There's a bit of pepper heat to go along with a whiff of wood smoke, and a nutty note as well, but at times, it can be slightly watery.\r  \n\r  \n***Palate with cigar****: Sweeter again, with candy sugar, sweet sherry, and some juicy orange. There's more vanilla, and the oak is more prevalent.*\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: It's a medium-long finish with light but warm Christmas spices and red wine/sherry influence. The spices again take the form of vanilla and cinnamon, though this is slightly creamier now, and generally sweet. We get raw nuts and orange, and later, just a hint of rich dark fruit.\r  \n\r  \n***Finish with cigar****: The vanilla turns toward creme brulee, and the wine becomes raspberry and sweet blackberry. There's also a hint of a tobacco smoke on the back end.*\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is nice, a pretty solid sherried whisky with some decent fruit and spice flavor development. The addition of a cigar to the experience really seemed to bring out the sweeter vanilla and fruit notes from the whisky, and they complemented each other well.

Review #80 - Barrell Dovetail,43,13dtali,https://i.redd.it/6ofzkn42r0za1.jpg,1683730964,,"[{'body': ""**Review #80 - Barrell Dovetail**\n\n*Cabernet Cask Mini-Series: Part 1 of 3*\n\nWe're starting a short series on whiskies that have some aging in Cabernet wine casks - the first of them is Barrell's Dovetail. As is generally the case with Barrell products, this is a sourced whisky which has undergone some unique aging and blending, and it comes in at a whopping cask strength of 62.62% ABV (at least for the bottle that we tried).\n\nOn top the Dunn Vineyard cab barrels, this whisky was also aged in both rum and Port barrels as well, so there should be a number of layers of flavor to dig into. We'll look for some red fruit notes from the wine, but also some sweeter tropical stuff from the rum barrels.\n\n**Barrell Dovetail**\n\nUSA - American Whisky\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 89\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 62.62% ABV \\[Varies by release\\]\n\n**Cask Makeup**: New charred oak, ex-rum, ex-Port, and Dunn Vineyard Cabernet barrels\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 40% fill level at time of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**:  Comes in a little hot, you have to work your way around the heat, but you're rewarded when you do - sweetness from dark cherries, licorice, brown sugar, and molasses. The spice is here as well, like anise, mild oak; it smells rich and buttery, that cocktail cherry note transforms into a sort of amaro flavor later on. \n\n**Palate**: Some heat again, but not too bad, and the mouthfeel is medium-thick. The palate is a little bit more oaky, spice, and dry than the nose - some amaro, a bitter pear, and cardamom all come to mind. There's also a nice sweet citrus, like orange, and then some cloves creep in. With more time to open up, there are dried fruits of raisin and sour fig; lots of layers here.\n\n**Finish**: It's a medium-length finish, on the warm side and with some mildly bitter wood tannins hanging around. There's some bitter liqueur like that amaro from the palate, but some sweetness does arrive at the end in the form of orange rind.\n\n**Final Note**: Wow, pretty tasty, lots of those dark mature notes of fruit and sugar and spice. Most of the bottles of this that we've seen on the shelf have been in the 120+ proof range, so it may not be easy for less experienced palates to sip neat, but it does offer so much flavor.

The distillery got its name because of its location: when dueling with pistols was still legal, the Linkumpinch farm was a popular place to settle these scores. The tasting room for the distillery was opened in a barn on the farm which dates back to these times of dueling.\n\nThe bourbon we're looking at is a bottled in bond product, so we know that it's aged at least four years and bottled at 50% ABV, or 100 proof. It's still a bit more difficult to come by if you aren't in the Kentucky/Midwest area, but distribution is slowly expanding, so more of us should get a chance to try this spirit.\n\n**Dueling Grounds Linkumpinch Straight Bourbon**\n\nUSA - Bourbon\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 59\n\n**Age Statement**: 4 Years\n\n**Strength**: 50% ABV\n\n**Details**: Bottled in bond\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 3 months; bottles at 90%, 80%, and 60% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Decently oaky to start, and there is some solid corn grain here, as well as a bit of maltiness and some oats. That oak is a bit musty, and it's adding mild wood smoke and char, as well as barrel spice. We do get some mild baking spice like brown sugar and the crust of a bread, even a hint of nuts, but the younger spirit character begins to creep through and dominate with heat and a bit of acetone. We end with another dry oak prickle and a bit of ash.\n\n**Palate**: Warm and a bit oaky, even a slight astringency, but some of the flavors on the palate are a bit mild. We start with vanilla bean and vanilla extract, with some white pepper creeping in later, along with barrel spice and some toasty char. The grainy character of corn and youth is back for a bit, but then we get some nice dark sugar notes of molasses and brown sugar syrup, even a hint of anise. Past all of the flavors, this is walking a fine line between sweet and dry - it's pretty well balanced. The mouthfeel is medium.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length finish, with some warmth and some oak again; it's a little sweeter now, but there's also lots of grain and young spirit character. Oats, cereal, corn, and even an occasional moonshine note pop in. The oak is toasty and dusty.\n\n**Final Note**: There's potential here, the flavor development for the age is pretty decent with the baking spices and oak notes. Despite that, this feels a bit young, like it isn't quite ready - a couple more years of aging should tone down the spirit and grain notes a bit, to make it a more rounded, complex, smooth tasting experience.

Its popularity has grown immensely in recent years - according to the 2023 Annual Brands Report by Drinks International, Monkey shoulder is currently one of the best-selling Scotch brands in the world.\r  \n\r  \nOriginally composed of the spirits from three Speyside distilleries (Glenfiddich, Balvenie, and Kininvie, supposedly), this blended malt is released in batches, and the current contents are not known. The theory is that this is still made up of Speyside malt whiskies.

There's pear and coconut as well, even stewed apples, and the bananas turn toward banana bread or bananas foster with time. Plenty of malty notes here, too, sort of smooth and inoffensive, but with nice maple syrup and a bit of grain as well. The oak is subtle, and it provides baking spices of cinnamon before we finish with white chocolate cookies and a tiny hint of tart cherry.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Rum and bananas, and a hint of youthful ethanol on the front of the palate, more malt and more cereal grain. It's creamy, though, like mushy bananas, white chocolate, a hint of milk chocolate, barley and wood sugars. The oak is more forward in the palate, and there are lots of baking spices: black pepper, cloves, cardamom, nutmeg, a mild vanilla. We even get some simple syrup or refined sugar sweetness; it's balanced by tart red apple. Later, there are baked goods and a light yeasty note, and the mouthfeel is medium-thin.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Finish is medium-short in length, with lingering notes of banana flavoring (like banana-flavored hard candies), sweet cinnamon, and some mild oak that continues to build to a soft tannin. The creamy malt and grain notes are still there, almost an oatmeal note, and we end with some maple syrup and dry vanilla.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Solid blended malt, nothing fancy, but no off flavors, and it doesn't feel 'cheap.' It has a lot of those nice, pleasant baking and light fruit notes that come with a classy ex-bourbon single malt, and the creamy texture is always a good sign. Let's talk about the real item of note here, though: value. We think this is pretty comparable in quality and taste to a lot of your Glenfiddich 12, Glenlivet 12, Balvenie 12 sort of single malts, all of which go for at least double the price of Monkey Shoulder (and some well over double).

Review #77 - Bruichladdich Octomore 12.2,98,131vqch,https://i.redd.it/72gq8dd63nwa1.jpg,1682694063,,"[{'body': ""**Review #77 - Bruichladdich Octomore 12.2**\r  \n\r  \n*Sauternes Cask Mini-Series: Part 3 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nFinishing up this Sauternes mini-series, we're back to Scotch, and this time it's heavily peated: Octomore 12.2, a 2021 release from the Bruichladdich distillery on Islay. An annual release, the Octomore series generally follows a specific numbering convention: this is the 12th year of release, and being a '.2' bottle, this would generally be the same spirit as the '.1' bottling, but have some wine cask maturation as opposed to just ex-bourbon maturation.\r  \n\r  \nThat's the case here - this year, instead of a sherry cask, this Octomore received the Sauternes treatment after some initial maturation in ex-bourbon barrels. The Concerto barley used was from the Scottish mainland, and was peated to a level of 129.7 ppm. How will the sweeter flavors of the wine cask interact with those heavy smoky flavors, especially at a cask strength of 57.3% ABV? Let's find out.\r  \n\r  \n**Bruichladdich Octomore 12.2**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Islay - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 230\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 295\r  \n**Age Statement**: 5 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 57.3% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon and sauternes casks\r  \n**Details**: Concerto barley from the Scottish mainland, peated to 129.7ppm\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 15 months; bottles at 100%, 90%, 80%, and 60% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Let's set the scene: you're next to an old stone hearth, with a fire burning both wood and peat inside. You've prepared quite the feast - you smell rich barbecue, like dry rub meats, musty sausage, and sauce. That will go nicely on your charcuterie board, where you have some hard cheeses already waiting (love that lactic Bruichladdich note). You smell the white wine you'll be drinking, along with some old, musty sherry; there are other fruity aspects, too, like crisp lemon, charred orange and orange cream, even some blackberries to balance the savory elements. That fire isn't roaring quite yet - it's a medium smoke so far, ashy and with a hint of the cigars you've smoked. To season the barbecue, you have some salt and bits of brown sugar; the final smells are some mild spirit sharpness, mixed with a whiff of perfume.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Well, that fire is roaring now. A blast of peat smoke with some medicinal and briny flavors, acrid wood smoke too - the oak is generally dry, adding notes of peppercorns, maple, and some dry vanilla, which turns more creamy later. No charcuterie can be complete without some jams for spreading - you have stone fruit and orange jams, and they're aided by a bit of dark fruit. Time for the main course: sweet barbecued ribs, oh so savory and a little bit salty. They're hot and oily and almost buttery. Taking in the scene, you can almost taste the damp hay you're sitting on next to the hearth. \\[The mouthfeel is thick.\\]\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The flavors of your feast last quite a long time, it will take a while to finish all of this. The savory and saucy notes of your oily main course linger, along with some white peppery spices you cooked with. The smokiness from the peat fire lingers and tickles as it coats your throat; when that smoke begins to blow away, the heat of the fire itself is still growing. A gust of wind tosses up notes of ash and charred wood. To cap your feast, you have a fruity, creamy dessert: notes of blood orange and charred fruit rind, along with lemon candies and butterscotch can all be enjoyed. \r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Lovely stuff, it's amazing that Bruichladdich is able to get this much complexity from whisky that's only five years old. Lots of different flavors to dissect - we really had to work to condense the notes we found over the course of our four tastings of this whisky into manageable paragraphs (they weren't really that manageable in the end, were they?). It seemed to change a bit each time we tasted it, and that always kept things interesting. As always, though, the trick with Octomore is the price - can 5 year old whisky ever really be worth $200+ or even more? It's hard to say yes, but if you have the funds to spare, these bottles offer a flavor hook that few others can match.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 8.3 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

I have gone to the whisky stores with a few hundred dollars with intent to finally buy a bottle of Octomore, but there is that attached stigma for me, regards to Octomore and young whisky and high cost. I always rationalize buying three or four good bottles instead of one Octomore. One day when I have disposable funds I will purchase a bottle.

Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**:  We get both sweeter oak and dry oak, and plenty of them; black pepper spice comes through, along with sweetness from caramel and maple syrup. There's a bit of fruit as well - orange citrus and some cherries.\n\n**Palate**: The spice comes forward even more on the palate - black pepper, rich oak, a bit of astringency, too. With time, that oak becomes a bit sweeter, with notes of molasses and maple syrup. It's oily and viscous, with a thick mouthfeel.\n\n**Finish**: The finish is medium length, and the experience turns back toward sweet with still more syrup and molasses. Then, as it dies away at least, the oak bites once more with some mild astringency.\n\n**Final Note**: This is a tasty bourbon - great for deep, dark oak notes and some complex syrupy sugars. The sauternes influence was pretty mild, but there was some sweetness in there to balance out the spice. The elephant in the room here is the price - when we tasted it, it was available for about $250. Now, it's more like $400 to get it online.

Review #75 - Glenmorangie Nectar D'or,28,12u5pj0,https://i.redd.it/8baabtyb49va1.jpg,1682089247,,"[{'body': ""**Review #75 - Glenmorangie Nectar D'or**\r  \n\r  \n*Sauternes Cask Mini-Series: Part 1 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nToday we're starting a quick series about whiskies with at least partial aging in Sauternes casks. Sauternes is a variety of sweet French wine which relies on 'noble rot' (a sort of beneficial fungus that grows on wine grapes) to dry out the grapes and concentrate sugar, greatly increasing the sweetness of the resulting wine.\r  \n\r  \nWe're going to be looking for some sweeter notes in these whiskies, but the results may be a bit deceptive - we have 3 spirits that differ quite a bit in their underlying character: a highland scotch with little to no peat, a bourbon, and a heavily peated scotch whisky. We'll do the best we can to pick out the sweet notes, but it remains to be seen how effective the experiment will be.\r  \n\r  \nThis first review may be the easiest to pick out the Sauternes influence: here we have the Glenmorangie Nectar D'or, a non age stated release (although on the brand's website, it does specify that the total maturation time is 12 years, at least for the current releases) from one of the Highlands' most popular distilleries. In addition to the obligatory Sauternes cask aging, there is of course some ex-bourbon American oak aging, the backbone of Glenmorangie's cask philosophy, so we can expect sweet tones in abundance. This is bottled at 46% ABV, which is a good start, but there's no mention of chill filtration or added coloring.\r  \n\r  \n**Glenmorangie Nectar D'or**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Highlands - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 66\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon (10 years) and Sauternes casks (2 years)\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 4 months; bottles at 100%, 60%, 90%, and 30% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Some spirit/distillate character up front - it isn't entirely covered up by the casks, and it's somewhat light and bright. It's mellow overall, but there are nice dry white wine notes and somewhat dry oak, along with lots of 'golden' flavors: honey, Chardonnay, golden raisins, hay, barley sugar, a bit of yeast and baked goods, too. There is barley grain and some dry vanilla, along with more baking spice of cinnamon, white pepper, cardamom, and brown sugar. Interestingly despite all of the bright baking flavors, there was also a slightly dirty note, sort of earthy or like wet pavement, like petrichor. We finish with fruits of white grape and pear, as well as some syrupy sweetness.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is a medium-thin thickness, and we get both wet and dry oak to start. A bit spirity, too, but there are decent dry tones from those casks like white pepper and nutmeg, some cinnamon, some dry vanilla, even dry white wine. The sweet notes then fight back: overly sweet dessert wine, wildflower honey, golden raisin, white grape, apple juice, and some salted caramel. Just a little more fruit with some orange, but then we get to baking ingredients: buttery, malty, powdered sugar, and cake icing are in there. We finish with saltine crackers and some perfume, as well as a bit of grain.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-short finish, with some dry oaky notes of tannins, vanilla bean, cinnamon, and anise; the ever-present white wine is there as well, along with some grainy malt - it's still somewhat spirit driven. We have fruits of white grape and orange, as well has some honey, a bit of yeast, and salty buttery crackers.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Tasty stuff, not really exceptional, but you might rate this a little higher if it's your preferred flavor. It continuously walks the line between dry and overly sweet, and there are plenty of baking spice and wine notes to go around. There are times that it comes across a bit young, but also enough flavor development to keep us happy, at least for a little while.

There's no age statement here, but we've generally found Caol Ila to be nice even at much younger ages, so we're not too worried about the youth. We're mostly looking to see how the distillery character was a couple of decades ago, when bottled at a higher strength.\r  \n\r  \n**Caol Ila Cask Strength**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Islay - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 150 \\[No longer available, secondary market pricing.

Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Pretty rich peat on the front end: ashy, mossy, sort of damp and green. Lots of your classic Islay elements here: brine, damp wood or driftwood, slightly vegetal at times, and some light savory meat. We have some dry red wine, and a bit of savory spice to go with it; then, it's on to fruit: lemon, overripe peach, and a bit of meaty blood orange. We finish with a slightly earthy smell.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Again, we get a big kick of peat on the front of the palate, it's pretty intense, though the experience past the smoke is pretty balanced. There is a bit of astringency running through the cheeks, along with a bit of an ethanol burn, but it's also oily with sweet Lemonhead candies and tart lemon juice. It turns a little dry later with ashier peat, driftwood, and some savory wood char. The mouthfeel is medium, and it's a richly flavored experience overall.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long finish - it's hot, oily, and quite peaty. There's sort of a campfire feel in the mouth, bitterness from the oak, and it's quite dry now as opposed to sweet. We do find some lemons and limes, even a few interesting notes like chai spice, and a very subtle savory taste. We finish with notes of watered down lemonade.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Tasty stuff, a pretty raw experience with likely some younger Caol Ila. Lots of peat, lots of that classic lighter lemon citrus distillery character you expect from this brand, and there are a few nicely layered savory and oaky notes on top. It can come across as a bit astringent at times, but it's nothing too severe, just a dry experience.

We have some seaside salty notes to go with it, and past the smoke, the complexion of the spirit is lighter in general: lots of citrus like sweet lemon, lime, and orange; heather and a hint of green moss; slightly herbal, floral, balanced by some tartness, as well as a mild metallic note later on. There are some oak notes: buttery oak, cinnamon, white pepper, and a mild vanilla arrive. We finish with some Chardonnay, and it's generally a bit delicate.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: More sweetness on the palate, and more peat, too - definitely a medium smoky experience at this point. The mouthfeel is medium as well, and overall, this is generally well balanced; lemon candies, sherbet and other fruit candy, but also salinity, buttery oak, pale oak, and a mild musty note like a cellar. There's some hay or dried grass, no real bitterness from the oak, and it's still quite light overall in complexion. Later on, it can become just slightly watery.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length finish, nice and round, somewhat clean as well. Tickles of peat linger, and some earthy heather notes pop up, along with a very soft wood smoke. There is a hint of that lemon fruit still here, but it fades, and we finish with a touch of vanilla. Pretty soft and subtle.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is nice, almost like a very subtle medium-peat salty Islay malt, or Islay-lite. Very well balanced, pleasant, and with a few interesting flavors, but it isn't overly complex; it doesn't necessarily have a big flavor hook to draw you in, either. Still, if you're looking for a laid back, classy dram with some peat, this is a solid place to look.

Review #72 - New Riff Balboa Rye,66,12jp2qu,https://i.redd.it/m6dask8bygta1.jpg,1681312016,,"[{'body': ""**Review #72 - New Riff Balboa Rye**\n\n*Specialty Rye Mini-Series: Part 3 of 3*\n\nTo wrap the series, we're headed back to New Riff for another specialty rye, and again we're focusing on the grain selection. This time, it isn't malting that sets this apart, but the choice in the specific strain of rye grain used: Balboa rye.\n\nBalboa rye is an older variety of rye grain, dating back to the 1940s. According to New Riff's website, it was popular in Indiana at the time; their corn farmer, Charles Fogg, has been growing the variety on his farm for many years. While it does have a lower yield than modern rye varieties, making it more expensive for whisky production, it is packed with more unique flavor, possibly adding 'shimmering notes of spiced fruit' - at least, if you believe the brand's tasting notes.\n\n**New Riff Balboa Rye**\n\nUSA - Rye\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 60\n\n**Age Statement**: 4 Years\n\n**Strength**: 50% ABV\n\n**Details**: Bottled in bond; mashbill of 95% rye, 5% malted rye; made using heirloom Balboa rye grain; not chill filtered\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 7 months; bottles at 70% and 100% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: There is some of that classic rye spice in there: a bit of pepper spice, but it's balanced by decent sweetness. Sweet malty grains, almost like barley, and some icing sugar and vanilla topping the cereal notes. There is a sweet oak influence as well, with a taste like syrupy brown sugar on pancakes, but then we get into some red fruit and barbecue - it can be just mildly savory.\n\n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium-thick, and lots of different spices are flourishing in the palate. We have rye spice, maple sugar, cinnamon, vanilla bean, even cardamom; the fruit is here again, too, with orange, and even a mild strawberry. There's a mild heat to go with the oily oak notes, and we end with a whiff of horchata.\n\n**Finish**: Finish is medium in length, nice and cozy with some mellow sugary fruit, which transitions toward baking spices once again. We have chai spice, vanilla, and black peppercorn, and some mild oak influence at this point. We end with some spice heat, like a pepper.\n\n**Final Note**: This is nice, not extremely far off of the typical rye notes, but there is a unique fruity-savory note in here that adds an extra layer of complexity. Not one to blow your socks off - this has plenty of flavor, but isn't coming across as shouty, at least to us. A solid whisky, and if you can get it for a good spice (maybe $60 or so), not a bad value pick, either.\n\n**Average Rating**: 7.3 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\n\n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\n\n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\n\n3 - Low end mixing whisky\n\n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\n\n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\n\n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\n\n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\n\n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\n\n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\n\n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\n\n**Value Rating**: 6.89"", 'score': 9}, {'body': 'Funny I just got an email from sharedpour about this today.

Review #71 - Hard Truth Sweet Mash Rye,18,12eo3id,https://i.redd.it/vr90bj5m8hsa1.jpg,1680879641,,"[{'body': ""**Review #71 - Hard Truth Sweet Mash Rye**\n\n*Specialty Rye Mini-Series: Part 2 of 3*\n\nThe second rye in our specialty rye mini-series is from Hard Truth in Nashville, Indiana. Instead of a specialty rye grain used in this whisky, it's the process that's different: as opposed to most American whiskies, which are mashed using a sour mash process (the addition of spent grains and back set from previous mash batches), this rye is made using a sweet mash process, which does not involve adding additional ingredients from previous batches. Because of this, the pH levels in the mash will differ, and the mash will be more vulnerable to infection/contamination; there are also supposedly changes in flavor - possibly a lighter and more delicate spirit being produced as a result of sweet mashing.\n\nThis Sweet Mash Rye also has the distinction of being Hard Truth's first shot at the full fermentation, distillation, and aging process - previous products released were generally sourced. This was batch 3 of their Sweet Mash Rye, aged in rackhouse #1, and came from a batch of 30 total barrels, which were dumped in February of 2022. With a strong ABV of 57.65%, as well as being uncut and unfiltered, we're looking forward to a full strength, full of flavor whisky.\n\n**Hard Truth Sweet Mash Rye**\n\nUSA - Rye\n\n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 70\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 70\n\n**Age Statement**: 2 Years\n\n**Strength**: 57.65% ABV\n\n**Details**: Mash bill 1, 30 barrel batch size, batch #3 (dumped in February 2022), uncut and unfiltered\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 6 months; bottles at 100%, 70%, and 50% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Big new charred oak notes here: lots of brown sugar, char, vanilla, caramel, and sugar to start out - it's generally pretty sweet. There's a bit of a sharper tannin to go along with that significant oak influence, too, or a black pepper kick; then we find some coconut, even pushing toward white chocolate. There are some fruits here, too, mainly orange zest or candied orange peel, a hint of pineapple juice, and later on, hints of cherry creep in. The spirit itself (regardless of oak aging) is adding some heat and a little bit of prickly youth, and we get some mineral notes, as well as earth and herbs, that classic rye taste. We finish off with cinnamon spice, which bridges toward red hot candies with time.\n\n**Palate**: Big time spice on this palate, and more of a return to normal younger rye notes. It's punchy with black and white pepper, licorice, waves of aniseed, herbal eucalyptus, oak tannins, and also wet oak. In general, this palate is more dry than the nose: we have wood smoke as well, a hint of ash, and a very strong mint note. There is sweetness, though, from baking spices and fruits - we have a subtle cherry once more, orange, molasses, vanilla, and a thicker syrup or maple sugar. There is a caramel candy notes, and the cherry fruit turns toward cherry candies, as well; overall, it's round and quite warm, with a medium-thick mouthfeel.\n\n**Finish**: The finish is medium in length, and the new oak influence is still pretty strong here, with vanilla, brown sugar, prickly anise, and simple syrup. The rye grain contributes is peppery notes, but the herbal taste is gone now. We end with dry oily oak, some heat, and some caramel.\n\n**Final Note**: Decent stuff, not exactly your run-of-the-mill rye, but not terribly far off either - there are still many of those spice and herb notes you expect with a rye. Is it a good value? Hard to say; it is more of a specialty product bottled at barrel strength, which is good, but the maturity and flavor delivery doesn't necessarily match up as much. We'll say the value is okay, might be worth picking up, though Hard Truth has already moved on to later releases with other twists on the usual recipe. We're not sure how big the distribution of this product is, either, as Hard Truth was established in 2015 - it's available all around us, but it might take time to creep out to markets further from home.\n\n**Average Rating**: 6.5 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\n\n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\n\n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\n\n3 - Low end mixing whisky\n\n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\n\n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\n\n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\n\n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\n\n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\n\n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\n\n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

So they need the acidity to keep the bad things out of the juice.\n\nSweet mash is a completely fresh fermentation every time.  It costs more and they have to clean similarly to how beer is brewed, every time.  They use stainless steel fermentation tanks and sterilize them.  This keeps the microbes out.  The process yields faster maturity and a distinct improvement in flavor that isn't exactly sweet, but sometimes seems like it.\n\nIt costs more money and is a significant investment.\n\nWilderness Trail, Kentucky Peerless, Castle & Key, and Hard Truth all do the sweet mash process and it is superior."", 'score': 2}, {'body': 'I know Old 55 makes everything from scratch at their farm.

Review #70 - New Riff 6 Year Malted Rye,143,12cn5cg,https://i.redd.it/4lq4y8yuy2sa1.jpg,1680706858,,"[{'body': ""**Review #70 - New Riff 6 Year Malted Rye**\n\n*Specialty Rye Mini-Series: Part 1 of 3*\n\nToday we're starting a short series on specialty ryes - this won't necessarily be referring to cask finishes, but rather the rye grains themselves, or some unique part of the distillation process. To start, we have New Riff's 6 year old Malted Rye, which has a mash bill consisting of 100% malted rye grain. This is unusual in that most ryes have at least some proportion of malted barley, and the vast majority also have some amount of corn grain included; additionally, most are made using unmalted rye.\n\nWhen we first found this bottle in a bar a couple of years ago, it was a new product that was hard to find, with most of the production being pushed out bar establishments on an allocated basis. Production has ramped up, it seems, and we're now seeing this semi-regularly in local liquor stores here in the Midwestern USA, so there is at least some availability now for us regular people to buy it. Price is pretty reasonable at $55 currently, especially considering that specialty grains are used to produce it (rye is notoriously somewhat difficult to work with, and malting is an extra step with some amount of additional cost), and it isn't being released after only a year or two of aging. We have high hopes for this bottle going into our reviews.\n\n**New Riff 6 Year Malted Rye**\n\nUSA - Rye\n\n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 55\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 55\n\n**Age Statement**: 6 Years\n\n**Strength**: 50% ABV\n\n**Details**: 100% malted rye mashbill, bottled-in-bond, not chill filtered\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 13 months; bottles at 90%, 100%, and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Somewhat mellow or soft at first, but creamy with mild spice, much less spice than the typical rye. There is a sort of candy, like creme fruit hard candies, with caramel and sweet malt coming through afterward. We are getting mild black pepper and nutmeg, even a bit of wood char, but those more bitter notes are easily balanced by baking spices of maple sugar and plenty of vanilla. One-off notes of red grape and smoked paprika can be found, and with time, the oak grows stronger, complemented by grain character and maple syrup. Overall, this is a well-balanced nose.\n\n**Palate**: Mellow at first again, but then more of a spice kick on this palate. It's a medium-thick mouthfeel, quite oily or even slightly syrupy, quite a nice texture. The spice is coming from pepper and nutmeg, anise and cinnamon, even some paprika and toasty oak. There are plenty of sweet notes here, too: maple sugar, vanilla and dark brown sugar, orange candy, blood oranges. The grain variety is adding some earthy notes, and some black tea later as well. Given more time to open up, strong caramel flavors appear, and the texture (not taste) becomes buttery and smooth.\n\n**Finish**: The finish is medium length, with lots of spice now lingering: black pepper warmth, rye, a hint of char, and buttery oak. With time, there are strong malty grain notes in here, almost like a milkshake, and a lingering soft, creamy mouthfeel. We have sweet notes, too, of vanilla, syrupy sugar, and rich orange; overall, it's a relatively mellow, restrained affair.\n\n**Final Note**: This is really nice, one of the most interesting ryes we've tasted that didn't involve some ridiculous cask finish used in the aging process (looking at you, Barrell). Unlike a lot of ryes, which boast quite a strong herbal and spicy taste, this is a much more subtle and mellow experience, but it's all the better for it. The creamy malty notes mixed in with baking spice are a delight. If you can find a bottle of this, value is generally pretty good, too - MSRP seems to be $50 or so, which we would happily pay again when our bottle runs out.\n\n**Average Rating**: 7.6 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\n\n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\n\n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\n\n3 - Low end mixing whisky\n\n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\n\n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\n\n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\n\n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\n\n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\n\n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\n\n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\n\n**Value Rating**: 7.49"", 'score': 27}, {'body': 'Please keep reviewing everything you come across.\n\nI’ve gone through and read your other reviews and our notes and impressions of different bottles are nearly identical!', 'score': 5}, {'body': ""Well damn, didn't know about this release...

Review #69 - Cinder & Smoke Batch IV,5,127o7nl,https://i.redd.it/wblxsooea3ra1.jpg,1680274892,,"[{'body': ""**Review #69 - Cinder & Smoke Batch IV**\n\nHailing from The Bard Distillery, this bourbon is a continuation of the original 13 year Cinder & Smoke bourbon bottling, which drew widely positive reviews. We no longer have an age statement, meaning this is likely a bit younger now, but we still have high hopes of some nicely oaked bourbon. Each batch consists of just 3 barrels, selected and blended by founders Kim and Thomas Bard.\n\nThe Bard Distillery is located in Graham, Kentucky, and began operations in 2019, meaning we have sourced whisky at this point in their more aged bottles. The establishment is located in an old schoolhouse, and was founded by Kim and Thomas Bard, who had been working in NASCAR - Kim as a driver, and Thomas as an engineer. Along with the Cinder & Smoke bourbon batches, the distillery is also producing a line of Muhlenberg-branded whiskies (several of them flavored), as well as some liqueurs.\n\n**Cinder & Smoke Batch IV**\n\nUSA - Bourbon\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 100\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 50% ABV\n\n**Details**: Batch IV, bottle 6 of 482; batch made up of 3 barrels\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 3 months; bottles at 90%, 80%, and 50% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Decently punchy and oaky to start, even with some wood smoke and ash puckering the cheeks. Lots of baking notes up front: light caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, and some spice from anise as well. There are nutty caramel/chocolate covered turtles - actually, on that nutty note, we get a pretty strong roasted peanut at this point, salty peanuts. There's a bit of orange oil or rind in there, and as this is open longer, the oak gets stronger, pushing the balance toward dry as opposed to sweet. Behind all of the baking and spice notes, we have some spirit character, grainy and still a bit young.\n\n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium-thick, with a kick coming from ABV and some oily rich oak - char and some tannins, as well. The sweet notes are stronger on the palate: syrup, wood sugars and creme brulee, vanilla, brown sugar, and pancakes all come to mind. Plenty of cooking and baking spices still linger, like cardamom, soft pepper spice, cinnamon, and a mild nutmeg. That cinnamon transitions toward a cinnamon oatmeal - the grain notes are still here, with corn and a touch of wheat flavor as well, and then we get more dusty salty peanuts once again. On another taste, we get just a hint of dark purple fruit, and the youth from the nose has gone away.\n\n**Finish**: It's a medium length finish, a little bit of heat lingering, but also some warmth from oak char and baking spices. There's a hint of astringency or tannins, even a prickle of anise or licorice, but the finish grows more subtle; we have some syrupy sweetness, vanilla, white pepper, and smoked paprika. We end with a bit of fresh lumber.\n\n**Final Note**: This is nice, not entirely polished or mature, but still decently complex and fun to explore. It's quite an oak-forward experience, both from the wood char taste, but also the baking spices, sugars, and dryness that has been contributed. We haven't tried the original 13 year batch, but if this younger spirit is anything to go by, it was probably quite good. Value here isn't the greatest, however - a decent whisky, but coming at a cost close to $100 makes it a bit harder to stomach.\n\n**Average Rating**: 6.3 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\n\n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\n\n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\n\n3 - Low end mixing whisky\n\n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\n\n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\n\n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\n\n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\n\n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\n\n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\n\n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #68 - Aberfeldy 12 Year,86,125qsn0,https://i.redd.it/vuzk8gn00pqa1.jpg,1680102069,,"[{'body': ""**Review #68 - Aberfeldy 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \nToday, we're looking at a highland stalwart, the 12 year single malt from Aberfeldy. Founded in 1896 and now owned by Bacardi via John Dewar & Sons, this distillery produces a sizeable amount of spirit, with a capacity of 3.4 million liters of pure alcohol per annum. This bottle is one of three basic core expressions, which also includes a 16 year old and a 21 year old.\r  \n\r  \nFor years, Aberfeldy has been one of the core components of the Dewar's blends - likely the largest malt component, at least. Typical characteristics are supposedly flavors like honey, mild spicy oak, and sweeter fruits, so we'll be on the lookout for some more casual, typical highland flavors, but we'll also see if it might have something more, or something unusual, to offer.\r  \n\r  \n**Aberfeldy 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Highlands - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 37\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 40% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 12 months; bottles at 60% and 40% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Light and smooth, with some fresh oak and quite a lot of apple. It's generally crisp and somewhat sweet; that apple transitions toward a mellow pear, and even some white grape later. We have vanilla and light caramel sugars, a touch of lemongrass, and with more time, the oaky flavors grow stronger.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Lighter bodied, a medium-thin mouthfeel; we start with some baking spices of vanilla and sugar, with a hint of dry perfumed oak adding a darker tone. The complexion is generally light, though, with some mixed tartness and sweetness from candied lemons, a grassy note, white grape, even a touch of white wine. Later, there's just a whiff of a savory red fruit.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: A short finish, with some green grass, as well as dried grass or hay. There is a bit of lemon zest and just a tickle of astringency from the oak, but it's balanced by sweeter notes from apple and pear.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Not bad, pretty inoffensive, but lacking more serious or heavy flavors that will lead to better complexity; nothing too unusual here. This would be great as a casual sipper, but with its mellow taste and lack of strength, it isn't likely to lead to a particularly interesting deep-dive session.

Review #67 - SMWS 48.124 'A Carpenter's Bench' - Balmenach 8 Year,22,120myey,https://i.redd.it/pa05ivwkbppa1.jpg,1679670078,,"[{'body': ""**Review #67 - SMWS 48.124 'A Carpenter's Bench' - Balmenach 8 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*SMWS 'Spicy and Sweet' Profile Mini-Series: Part 3 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThe third and last Spicy and Sweet bottle we'll be tasting in this series is from Balmenach, specifically an 8 year old bottled at a cask strength of 60.6% ABV. This is another malt that isn't really available as an OB (once upon a time it was, as a part of the Flora & Fauna series, when the distillery was owned by Diageo's predecessor), with the bulk of the distillery's production going toward Inver House blends. It is occasionally available via IB, though, so we snagged one when we got the chance.\r  \n\r  \nThe character of the distillate is supposedly fruit and spicy, good for sherry cask maturation, and due to the use of worm tubs for condensation of the spirit vapors, there can be some meatier or heavier notes as well. The whisky in our bottle was aged in an ex-bourbon cask, though, so we'll see if we get some unexpected results.\r  \n\r  \n**SMWS 48.124 'A Carpenter's Bench' - Balmenach 8 Year**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Speyside - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 95\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: Sold out, no longer available\r  \n**Age Statement**: 8 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 60.6% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: First fill ex-bourbon barrel\r  \n**Details**: 1 of 221 bottles, distilled November 2012\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 12 months; bottles at 100%, 90% (blind tasting), and 60% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Starts out as a fruit bomb, lots going on in this sweet bouquet: lemon, apple, orange cream, overripe pear, and some red wine sweetness. It does turn a little darker with some plum as well, but it's always balanced by lighter, more crisp notes, maybe even some white wine sangria. There is some baking spice as well: dry vanilla bean pods, some cardamom, maybe a bit of clove in there. Despite the aging of only eight years, there is actually a decent oak kick here, and it's very heavily perfumed and somewhat floral at times. Given more time, the spirit backbone begins to reveal itself: barley sugar, creamy oats and grain, and due to the ABV, definitely some heat.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Bold and intense, and starts out with some of that heat that was clear on the nose - the mouthfeel is medium-thick, and this is somewhat hot and woody and spicy. The oak comes across as sawdust and baking spice, along the lines of cinnamon, a dash of pepper, cayenne, and dry vanilla. There's even a burnt sugar crust it, but it's creamy as well, with some milk chocolate on a second taste. Below the spice, there is a mellow layer of fruit that begins to balance things out, though we probably wouldn't call this 'smooth.' We get applesauce and some lemon curd, and later on, those grain and oat notes come back.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish length is medium-long, and while still pleasantly warm, some of the heat has dropped off now. It's quite oily and somewhat dry and spicy, still - wood chips, tannins, driftwood, maybe some wood smoke as well. There are muted dry fruits now, mostly lemon, and we end with vanilla, a kick of spirit, and a bit of lingering perfume.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is pretty tasty, and that blast of fruit to start is always a treat; it's nice to get the full range of fruity colors, from light and yellow to dark and purple. Once in the palate, the spicy oak is a refreshing twist compared to the fruit; paired with the heat of the dram, though, it can fry your palate a bit if you aren't ready. We liked this one the most of these three whiskies we just reviewed - it has good complexity, beyond what its age would suggest. If this were still available, we'd be picking up another bottle.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 8.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\r  \n\r  \n**Value Rating**: 7.01"", 'score': 3}, {'body': 'Ahhh, best hard to find distillery. Love everything from them. It’s just so old school. Great review.', 'score': 2}, {'body': ""What is everyone's favorite hard-to-find distillery?"", 'score': 1}, {'body': 'Thank you!

Thank you everyone for sending your responses to the post on Monday - the engagement was great, far more than expected! 

*The original post:* [https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/11x0neu/what\_are\_your\_top\_5\_favorite\_scotch\_whisky\_brands/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/11x0neu/what_are_your_top_5_favorite_scotch_whisky_brands/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**How the scoring worked:**

1. Distilleries/brands listed in order (as far as I could tell) were awarded 5 points for 1st, 4 points for 2nd, 3 points for 3rd, 2 points for 4th, and 1 point for 5th
2. If the commenter specified “in no particular order,” each brand listed was awarded 3 points (the average of 1-5 scoring)
3. If honorable mentions were included in the comment, each honorable mention brand was awarded 0.5 points

Without further ado, here are the results! Drum roll, please…

r/Scotch’s favorite brand is… **LAPHROAIG!**

Here are your top 10 brands (full chart further down):

&#x200B;

**A few general notes and impressions:**

* We received 165 responses in total, casting a total of 915 votes
* 95 different brands received votes
* Distillery branded single malts received the *vast* majority of the votes, as opposed to blends and independent bottlers
* r/Scotch is full of peat heads! 6 of the top 10 distilleries reside on Islay, and at least 2 of the other 4 produce widely available heavily-peated whiskies

&#x200B;

And here are the full lists for both brands and distilleries:

Review #66 - SMWS 41.147 'Brooding Armchair Dram' - Dailuaine 15 Year,15,11ylvua,https://i.redd.it/dlyawtza3bpa1.jpg,1679497663,,"[{'body': ""**Review #66 - SMWS 41.147 'Brooding Armchair Dram' - Dailuaine 15 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*SMWS 'Spicy and Sweet' Profile Mini-Series: Part 2 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nAnother hard-to-find distillate, and another Diageo brand which can occasionally be found in independent bottlings. I guess we could have named this series 'Speyside Diageo-Owned Whiskies with Minimal Core Ranges bottled by the Scotch Malt Whisky Society,' but that doesn't have much of a ring to it...\r  \n\r  \nDailuaine is another distillery that contributes greatly to the Johnnie Walker blends. Owned by Diageo and residing in Carron, Aberlour in Speyside, this whisky is essentially non-existent in the distillery bottling realm - it's only available occasionally via independent bottlers. Like the Linkwood in our prior review, we were drawn to this whisky from the SMWS after hearing about the character of the distillery, but our only route to taste it was via an independent. As with many distilleries under Diageo's ownership, there is supposedly a very good malt here, hidden behind blending/chill-filtration/lack of availability. Luckily, we were able to find a release available in our area.\r  \n\r  \n**SMWS 41.147 'Brooding Armchair Dram' - Dailuaine 15 Year**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Speyside - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 155\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: Sold out, no longer available\r  \n**Age Statement**: 15 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 59.8% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon hogshead, finished in 2nd fill ex-PX hogshead\r  \n**Details**: 1 of 261 bottles, distilled March 2006\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 6 months; bottles at 90%, 80%, 70% (blind tasting), and 50% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: This nose starts quite closed up, mellow, cohesive; it takes a while to open up and reveal its real flavors. Brown sugar and maple sugar come to the front, with some classic ex-bourbon notes; there's oak, like furniture wood, and some baking spices of vanilla, cinnamon, and then creamy vanilla bean, even bordering on creme brulee. There are a decent number of fruits here, too: white grape, turning to grape soda, orange soda, dry fig, and some prune/raisin. There's even a bit of apple, or spiked apple cider, in there. Once given sufficient time, the classic older whisky notes come out: leather, old books, shoe polish, coffee, more furniture wood, even a bit of toast in the oak.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Refined, but with some heat, and very rich overall, with a thick mouthfeel. We start with lots of oak notes: maple sugar, char, wood smoke, wood spice, and some old furniture. There are lots of sugar notes, too: creme brulee, rum sauce, syrupy molasses, dark brown sugar, and wood sugar. The fruits are back as well: bananas, orange, but then it starts to get darker, like raisin and fig, prune and overly sweet medicinal cherries. There is a tickle around the palate from spices of vanilla, clove, white pepper, and nutmeg; the oak grows richer as well. There is a slight dirtiness to the spirit, and some oats, but this has mostly been covered up by the oak from aging. The palate ends with some flowery perfume.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is warm and medium-long, with lots of lingering richness and sweetness from the sherry finish. There are grape and plum, along with baked goods like cinnamon rolls topped with brown sugar. We find molasses, semi-sweet chocolate chips, chalky dark chocolate, and a bit of wood smoke, too; the oak notes are plentiful in general. After a little bit of shoe polish and orange fruit, there is a little peppery kick at the end, a hint of bitterness.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Compared to the younger Linkwood from our last review, this Dailuaine is nicely matured, with many of those stronger, darker oak and polish notes we look for with some age. There is decently complexity here, with plenty of spices and fruits, but overall, this is a pretty subtle malt - nothing really stands out, nothing grabs the attention. Maybe that's why we haven't gone a little higher with the rating? A good whisky, yes, but not quite excellent. And, because of that pesky pricing with a lot of modern IBs, value isn't exactly stellar.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.8 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\r  \n\r  \n**Value Rating**: 5.77"", 'score': 2}, {'body': ""Which is everyone's favorite Johnnie Walker whisky?"", 'score': 1}, {'body': ""I haven't had one I cared for,  but I LOVE me some Dailuaine!"", 'score': 2}, {'body': 'Nice, what are some of your favorites?', 'score': 1}, {'body': ""The [Flora and Fauna is not bad at all](https://old.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/ouwuvk/scotch_review_11_dailuaine_16_flora_and_fauna/?ref=share&ref_source=link), but I probably rated it way too high.\n\nMost of the Dailuaine I've had has been IBs from Signatory.

Review #65 - SMWS 39.217 'Crunchy and Homely' - Linkwood 8 Year,23,11ttl1i,https://i.redd.it/77ehl65idboa1.jpg,1679065263,,"[{'body': ""What is everyone's favorite independent bottler?"", 'score': 3}, {'body': 'SMWS naming is so pretentious I refuse to buy a bottle, lol. That being said, I’ve always wanted to try some 😄', 'score': 2}, {'body': '**Review #65 - SMWS 39.217 \'Crunchy and Homely\' - Linkwood 8 Year**\r  \n\r  \n*SMWS \'Spicy and Sweet\' Profile Mini-Series: Part 1 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThis is the first time we\'ve looked at any Scotch Malt Whisky Society (SMWS) bottles in our reviews, despite a focus on Scotch in our whisky journey, and also the fact that we own about a dozen of the brand\'s bottles now. In this series, we\'ll be looking at SMWS bottles in a specific flavor profile, \'Spicy and Sweet,\' which is denoted on the current generation of bottles by the vivid purple bands/stripes. According to the brand, flavors in this profile might be along the lines of ""gingerbread, hot cross buns, mulled wine and even balsamic strawberries,"" as well as ""the culinary experience of bringing spice into sweet dishes, the addition of cinnamon to pastries or sweet chilli flavours.""\r  \n\r  \nThe SMWS generally bottles single cask single malt Scotch whiskies, though they have been diversifying into a few other spirits in recent years (bourbon, rye, Armagnac, and rum, among others), as well as blending their own small batch whiskies. Quality can vary from bottle to bottle (as with all independent bottlers focusing on single casks), but from our experience, the quality floor is generally pretty high.\r  \n\r  \nThe elephant in the room with SMWS is the fact that they\'re pay to play - to have access to their bottle selection in the first place, you must pay a yearly membership fee; then, once you get to purchasing the individual bottles themselves, they\'re far from cheap, especially once you factor in the shipping costs. One factor in the prices of the whiskies, though, may be the great craft presentation - all bottles (of the single malts, at least) are bottled at cask strength, with no chill filtration and no added coloring.\r  \n\r  \nStill, despite the cost, there was one big reason we got involved with this brand - availability. In our part of the Midwestern US, general availability of independently bottled Scotch whisky has been poor for a while. It\'s slowly improving, but we still don\'t have access to most of the reputable IBs. SMWS, specifically the US affiliate, on the other hand, was able to ship to our state, which opened up our journey to dozens of distilleries that we otherwise would have no access to. At a point in our journey where we were trying to expand our horizons and experience as much variety in whisky as possible, this was important to us; that, paired with the good reviews we generally saw of this brand\'s bottles, was enough for us to overcome the price barrier. Anyways, enough about the brand - what about this specific bottle?\r  \n\r  \nThe bottle in this review is from the Linkwood distillery, one in the Speyside region that is owned by Diageo, which does not generally produce a core range of distillery bottlings. The only expression of note is the 12 year Flora & Fauna bottling; much of the rest of production goes into Johnnie Walker blended whiskies. Because of this rarity, we have to turn to IBs to get a taste of the spirit.\r  \n\r  \nThis bottle was aged in a first-fill bourbon barrel for 8 years before being bottled at a natural cask strength of 60.4% ABV. General characteristics of the Linkwood spirit are reported to be light, with grass or heather notes, and some lighter fruits like apple and stone fruit. We\'ll be on the lookout for those, along with some strong bourbon cask sugar and oak notes.\r  \n\r  \n**SMWS 39.217 \'Crunchy and Homely\' - Linkwood 8 Year**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Speyside - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 100\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: Sold out, no longer available\r  \n**Age Statement**: 8 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 60.4% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: First fill ex-bourbon barrel\r  \n**Details**: 1 of 201 bottles, distilled September 2012\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 2 months; bottles at 90%, 80%, and 70% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Starts of strong and spritely, with some brighter flavors of sherbet and cherry soda, along with wood sugars. We quickly move toward a lot of vanilla - this is in the form of dry vanilla bean, as well as liquid vanilla extract. There is some dry oak here, and a bit of a malty grain, and then we move toward other spices and baking elements: white pepper, a hint of black pepper, brown sugar, and raw almond nuttiness. Speaking of nuts, we get a bit of peanut, too, which transitions toward toasted coconut, creamy icing sugars, creme brulee, and sweet Hawaiian rolls. With more time to open up, the nose turns fruity: lemon, pineapple, and a tart fruit jam. There\'s sweetness from butterscotch, and a hint of herbal eucalyptus. Quite a bit going on, really.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Punchy, very spirit forward and youthful and grainy, with a medium-thick mouthfeel. Lots of oats and cereal notes, along with baking spices of cinnamon, vanilla sugar, and a darker demerara sugar, which turns toward butterscotch and honey. Plenty of oak here, too: spice, almost toward a rye spice, and some mild charcoal later on, even a bit of old furniture wood. Fruit has mostly melted away except for a bit of banana, but then some buttery chardonnay and oil come in - it\'s a bit crisp and fiery overall, but not too dry. Ends with some nut butter.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is medium length, some heat from the ABV, though it fades quickly, leaving some oily oak. Very mild baked bread and cinnamon spice. There is a little bit of fruit coming back, sweet citrus between lemon and orange, which transitions toward some blood orange at the end.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: While the nose excited us and took a while to digest, the palate and finish become more one-dimensional, and the youth began to show - this might have needed a little more time in the cask to finish developing. It has plenty of strength with the high ABV presentation, but some more mature flavors in the later parts of the tasting would bring the score up. Still, not bad overall, just a bit unpolished. Value is mediocre because of the hefty price of the SMWS bottles, and we aren\'t even factoring the membership fee into this calculation.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn\'t even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don\'t buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn\'t use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we\'ve tasted\r  \n10 - Can\'t imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we\'ve added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\r  \n\r  \n**Value Rating**: 6.03', 'score': 1}, {'body': 'Cadenhead is solid', 'score': 3}, {'body': 'Yeah, some of the stylistic choices can be an acquired taste, but I think some of the names are so silly, it’s also a good sign that they don’t take themselves too seriously.

Review #64 - Glenmorangie 14 Year Quinta Ruban,177,11ryxdr,https://i.redd.it/ixhtgi843xna1.jpg,1678892404,,"[{'body': ""**Review #64 - Glenmorangie 14 Year Quinta Ruban**\r  \n\r  \n*Port Cask Finish Mini-Series: Part 3 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThe last of these three port cask whisky reviews sees us return to Scotland, to the Highlands, and to Glenmorangie. Here we find the 14 year Quinta Ruban, a staple in the distillery's core range. It is aged initially in ex-bourbon casks, supposedly for around 10 years, after which it spends about 4 years aging in Ruby Port pipes.\r  \n\r  \nLike the others in this series, we're expecting some nice dark flavors of fruit and possibly chocolate, and if the rumored 4 years of port finishing is correct, those flavors may be a bit heavier here. Glenmorangie's spirit is also known in the community for taking on finishing casks relatively well, so we're hoping for a cohesive, mature experience, too.\r  \n\r  \n**Glenmorangie 14 Year Quinta Ruban**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Highlands - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 50\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 45\r  \n**Age Statement**: 14 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Initially ex-bourbon, finished in ruby port pipes\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 11 months; bottles at 50%, 50%, 40% (blind tasting), and 30% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: There's a decent complexity, plenty going on: it's sweet and lightly perfumed, and while we start with some ex-bourbon notes of dark oak and a hint of leather, maybe even a touch of wood smoke, it's quickly changing to a heavier cask influence. Plenty of fruits: raspberry, strawberry jam, a hint of orange, fig, reddish in general; there's a nice chocolate note to go with it, dark cocoa which turns toward cherry cola. Plenty of baking spices as well: cinnamon, clove, cardamom, and mild vanilla to name a few, along with some yeasty bread, candied nuts, and burnt sugar. Behind all of this, there is a mild backbone of spirit - lightly earthy, mineral, even a mild tropical taste.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: We start out sweet again, though it is maybe a little more dry and balanced than the nose; the mouthfeel is medium, but there is a somewhat viscous chocolate syrup coming to the front, even a molasses syrup. As the palate opens, that chocolate transitions to milk chocolate, and then more of a tart dark chocolate later, or spiced Mexican cocoa. The fruits are back as well, with raspberry and rich cherry, before it turns toward a darker fig with salt and nuts. There's some light oak that adds a mild bitter tannin, and along with caramel, a bit of unsmoked tobacco leaves. The spirit influence we mentioned in the nose is still there, only just: very slightly dirty or funky, with some hay and sassafras at the end.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length, round and oily, with just a soft warmth. Perfume and sweet port notes are plentiful: chocolate, cola, wine, and nuts, both dried and candied. The baking theme returns as well, with cardamom and Christmas spices, maybe even a maple syrup note, and the oak adds a puff of wood smoke once more. The spirit notes are still there, but still just a hint behind a strong cask influence.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is pretty good, definitely our favorite of the Glenmorangie core range of whiskies. While the spirit is pretty smothered by the strong cask flavors, there is still plenty of complexity to explore, and those who enjoy sweeter whiskies will likely be a fan. Prices on this bottle at generally very good, too, at least where we are - it's a great value pick. Overall, a strong recommendation from us.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.7 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Absolutely no thank you on that.', 'score': 8}, {'body': ""**Review #63 - Angel's Envy Bourbon**\n\n*Port Cask Finish Mini-Series: Part 2 of 3*\n\nThe second whisky in our port cask series is a bourbon - Angel's Envy, specifically. This bourbon is finished in port casks, so we'll be looking for some of those sweet dark fruit flavors along with the classic bourbon notes.\n\nOne of the things that Angel's Envy is known for is their cask finishes - their two most common products, this bourbon and their rye, both use finishing casks after their initial maturation. The rye, which is finished in Caribbean rum casks, has quite a strong sweet rum flavor, and we generally liked that about it, even if it could be a little overpowering compared to the base spirit itself. Let's find out if we like this bourbon's finish as well.\n\n**Angel's Envy Bourbon**\n\nUSA - Bourbon\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 40\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 43.3% ABV\n\n**Cask Makeup**: Finished in port casks\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 15 months; bottles at 60% and 20% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: There's a bit of spice to start, like clove and brown sugar, with a bit of mild oak creeping in as well. It's decently rich and rounded, and now the sweeter notes come in: cherry, plenty of cherry, along with a bit of cola and some other reddish fruit. It can be a little mellow and reserved, but it ends with a backbone of more spice: nutmeg and black pepper.\n\n**Palate**: Medium mouthfeel, maybe medium-thin; there is a more pronounced dryness and spice on the palate. There's black pepper and oak, which is balanced by sweetness of brown sugar and orange fruit. The red fruit is now more tart like a cranberry, and the whole experience ends feeling slightly watered down.\n\n**Finish**: The finish is medium length, and the oak is still a little spicy, but not too astringent. The black pepper is transitioning more toward white pepper, and while the whole thing is a bit mild, there is a nice cranberry kick once more.\n\n**Final Note**: This was alright - the classic bourbon profile definitely still comes through, it isn't entirely covered by the red fruit of the port finish. That said, this feels a bit watered down; yes, the proof stated on the bottle isn't exactly high, so we could have expected this to a degree, but we still would have liked a greater concentration of flavors. Still, this isn't a terribly expensive bottle, so the value is okay.\n\n**Average Rating**: 5.8 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\n\n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\n\n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\n\n3 - Low end mixing whisky\n\n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\n\n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\n\n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\n\n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\n\n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\n\n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\n\n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

I can't drink the thing unless it is paired with a sweet dulce-de-leche Haagen-Dasz or something similar.

Also, a local shop has a single-barrel pick that is mind-blowingly good at 110 proof. It delivers the boldness of flavors and more of the bourbon flavor profile I'd like.\n\nAll that said, I find that most finished bourbons leave me a bit cold.

Review #62 - Dalmore Port Wood Reserve,32,11m0chc,https://i.redd.it/yeppbwtyhjma1.jpg,1678291920,,"[{'body': ""**Review #62 - Dalmore Port Wood Reserve**\r  \n\r  \n*Port Cask Finish Mini-Series: Part 1 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nOur next series is focusing on whiskies with some port maturation, generally a finish after prior aging in more standard barrels. Port is a sweet fortified dessert wine from Portugal, and we're expecting to get some sweeter fruity notes in these whiskies - perhaps similar to Oloroso sherry or PX sherry notes, but possibly even darker and sweeter.\r  \n\r  \nThe first whisky on the list is Dalmore's Port Wood Reserve, coming in at a solid 46.5% ABV. As this is Dalmore, there's no mention of chill filtration or coloring, so it's likely that a healthy dose of each has been used; still, the Dalmore spirit can be quite interesting in its natural form, so we're hoping a little bit of that character manages to sneak through. There's no age statement here, either, so other than port maturation, we're not quite sure what to expect.\r  \n\r  \n**Dalmore Port Wood Reserve**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Highlands - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 84\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 89\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 46.5% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Finished in port casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 16 months; bottles at 100%, 80% (blind tasting), 70%, and 30% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Nice nose, decently rich but definitely subtle. There's lots of red notes: red wine, fruits of plum and cherry and strawberry; even darker fruits like blackberry, fig, and prune show up later. The theme of darker notes continues: chalky chocolate, even malty chocolate, and some mildly bitter tobacco, a touch of sassafras. Lots of sugary notes as well, like brown sugar and caramel, and then just a bit of dusty grain sneaks through. Oak begins to peek through, but overall, this is somewhat restrained and a little more delicate - you have to dig into it.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The medium mouthfeel provides some dark, stewed, acidic fruit (prune and plum) and some dry red wine, but this is still a bit restrained overall. A little bit of sweet dark syrup, but it's balanced out by a spice from the oak and some pepper. The chocolate comes back, in the forms of both milk and dark, and one time, even a spiced Mexican chocolate. There is light tobacco smoke and malt, and continuing the theme of dark notes, some Coca-Cola, or even Cherry Coca-Cola. Behind it all, though, there is an interesting lighter taste - it's like a mild tropical fruit, which turns toward mild pear.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length finish, bordering on short, a bit mild and mellow. Some sweetness lingers from Coca-Cola and Tootsie Roll candy, a little bit of creamy chocolate, and some mulled red wine. The acidity of the palate's fruit is tempered now, but there is still a mild spice kick from the oak; at the end, just a small ethanol warmth.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Nice and subtle, there is some interesting flavor here, but you have to dig for it at times. A nice balance between sweeter notes of chocolate and fruit, along with bitter notes of oak spice and tobacco. One of the better Dalmore whiskies we've had, for sure, and it surprised us a couple of times in blind tastings. In terms of value - it's decent, but nothing special.

As you'd expect, it comes in at 101 proof, or 50.5% ABV, so there should be a decent kick here. We'll see how it is neat, but we also suspect this one might make a solid rye for cocktails given the proof and price point.\n\nWith a mashbill of 51% rye (the minimum allowed), 37% corn, and 12% barley, we wouldn't be surprised if this has some flavor overlap with the 101 Bourbon, as well, which could be a good thing - we think the bourbon is one of the best value bottles around. While we don't have any sort of age statement here, this is a straight rye with no specific age, meaning it must be at least 4 years old; rumor is, there could be some whisky in here that's up to 6 years old.\n\n**Wild Turkey 101 Rye**\n\nUSA - Rye\n\n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 22\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 22\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 50.5% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 16 months; bottles at 50%, 90%, and 10% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Ground pepper and a bit of salt, nice caramel, and some oak to start; the herbal rye notes are pretty subdued right now. There is a bit of heat, a bit of ethanol in the taste, but we transition toward mild fruit of banana, saucy orange, or even some red wine. There's some mint, and with time, the herbal rye notes grows stronger; at the end, we get mild vanilla and just a hint of nuttiness.\n\n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium, and there is much more of a classic rye kick on this palate: herbal eucalyptus, black pepper, chili heat, white pepper. It's warm, and we get some spicy orange pepper jam, plenty of oil, even a mild hot cherry jam there, too. There is a decent amount of oak after that, and after a mild grain note, we get more of the sugars like creme brulee topping and some mild vanilla/caramel.\n\n**Finish**: Medium length finish with plenty of vigor; spicy like pepper, cinnamon, and rye; the warmth from the ABV is still there, though the ethanol taste is covered nicely by rich oak. There is more fruit now: spiced apples and a reddish fruit take center stage, but then sweetness from vanilla and cream back it up. It ends slightly earthy and herbal.\n\n**Final Note**: This is solid, not the most complex rye, but still a decent sipper. For us, this is a perfect rye for making a solid cocktail, like a Sazerac or Manhattan - its higher proof gives plenty of flavor and kick, while it's also well rounded enough to mix well with a variety of flavors. For the last couple of years, it has been our go-to for rye cocktails. The last item of note - great value here, just like the 101 bourbon.

Review #60 - Backbone Straight Wheat Single Barrel,10,11f7gy8,https://i.redd.it/3vk9xyuqh5la1.jpg,1677686490,,"[{'body': ""**Review #60 - Backbone Straight Wheat Single Barrel**\n\nToday, we're looking at a single barrel offering from Backbone, and this one is a wheat whisky. Coming in at a cask strength of 59.15% ABV, and with an age only around 3 years, there is likely to be some heat, but we're hoping to find some less common flavors with the heavy wheat mashbill. That grain can often lend a more gentle characteristic to the distillate (like those 'smooth' wheated bourbons), so we may have to dig a bit deeper and unwrap some more delicate flavors.\n\n**Backbone Straight Wheat Single Barrel**\n\nUSA - Wheat Whisky\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 60\n\n**Age Statement**: 3 Years\n\n**Strength**: 59.15% ABV\n\n**Details**: Bottle 49 of 228; MGP mashbill with high wheat content (supposedly 95%)\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 8 months; bottles at 100%, 80%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: A bit mellow and subdued starting out, and despite some heat that comes with the ABV, there is a softer side to this. Plenty of grain character in the nose, and after sneaking around a hint of acetone, flavors of oak, sweet caramel, wood spice, and maple sugar come through. There are baking spices like cinnamon and a little bit of brown sugar, and it ends with a mild savory tang.\n\n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium-thick and oily, but this is quite hot, with a lot of barrel spice or tannins adding to the punch. It's quite oak-forward now, with some astringency, but it adds plenty of baking spices as well - pepper, vanilla, wood sugar, clove, and even a bit of anise come to mind. With the youth comes spirit character, especially in the form of grain and a hint of maltiness; then, there is some red wine and a hint of smoky campfire, or even a barbecue. Overall, it isn't too refined.\n\n**Finish**: The finish is medium in length, and there is still quite a heat kick going on. Oily and spicy, with pepper and nutmeg, and that wood tannin comes back. At the end, a very gentle sweetness comes in, but it's mild and doesn't last long.\n\n**Final Note**: This is okay - because of the strength and lack of time to develop in the casks, it definitely comes across a bit hot and grainy. The flavor development isn't quite there yet, but all of that said, it isn't unpleasant to drink, just a bit simple. There are some nice baking notes, and that mild barbecue flavor was a pleasant find. Would we buy a bottle? Probably not, at least with only 3 years of aging.\n\n**Average Rating**: 5.3 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\n\n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\n\n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\n\n3 - Low end mixing whisky\n\n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\n\n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\n\n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\n\n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\n\n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\n\n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\n\n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\n\n**Value Rating**: 5.45"", 'score': 3}, {'body': ""How many here have tried a wheat whisky?

Review #59 - Glen Scotia Victoriana,112,11auv21,https://i.redd.it/lgdsz0aot5ka1.jpg,1677254651,,"[{'body': '**Review #59 - Glen Scotia Victoriana**\r  \n\r  \n*NAS Campbeltown Mini-Series: Part 3 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nTo finish up this mini-series, it\'s time to look at the last of Campbeltown\'s three established distilleries, Glen Scotia. Here, we have their Victoriana single malt, a non age stated cask strength whisky coming in at 54.2% ABV for this batch. According to the label, it spends some time maturing in deep charred oak casks; other casks types used in aging are unspecified.\r  \n\r  \nGlen Scotia Victoriana also has the distinction of winning the category of Best Single Malt Scotch Whisky in the 2022 Online Scotch Whisky Awards (OSWAs). Regardless of whether or not you agree in general with influential online whisky personalities like Roy Duff of Aqvavitae and Ralfy (Youtubers and the hosts of the OSWAs), it\'s hard to deny that their OSWA initiative is gaining steam, and the online whisky community has spoken about their growing attachment to this specific bottling of whisky.\r  \n\r  \n**Glen Scotia Victoriana**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Campbeltown - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 95\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 95\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 54.2% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Finished in ""the finest deep charred oak casks""\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 1 month; bottles at 100%, 90%, and 70% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Rich, pungent, very strong nose overall. This is pulling us in a lot of directions; it\'s difficult to know where to start. In terms of oak notes, we have wood sugar, caramel sugar, and some baking spices like vanilla; a bit of wood smoke or earthy char as well. There is some mustiness in there, like a damp cellar, but that transitions into lighter fruit flavors: citrus oil of oranges (or charred orange rind), mild stone fruit like dried apricot, and then ginger. There is peat and mild machine oils notes, and lower in the glass, a milk chocolate note, which grows stronger with time. It can be slightly meaty at times, and due to some heat, you have to tiptoe (with your nose) around the glass.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is thick, and this is rich again, with a solid mixture of sweetness and spice, which transitions later to mild bitterness. Plenty of baking spices: cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, and ginger, some vanilla, even bridging into actual baked goods like cookies or shortbread. The mild peat is back, along with char and sugary oak, and the chocolate comes back with some sharper white pepper mixed in. In terms of fruit, there is a strong orange flavor here, but behind that, we have mild raisin. To finish out the palate: lots of oiliness, some musty and meaty notes, paprika spice, and a mild perfume.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is medium-long with mild peat smoke and wood char, even a bit of ash. There are lots of baking spice notes now: brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, nuttiness, and baked breads dominate, with decent sweetness overall. The oak is ever-present with mild tannins and a hint of aged leather, and we get those same orange and stone fruit tastes later as well, even a bit of red fruit or red wine. It ends with a mild heat and musty cellar note.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Wow, what a blast of flavor. The nose especially takes us in so many directions, it\'s hard to pick one, and there are some notes that are a bit hard to place; in the palate and finish, it becomes a bit more cohesive. While there is complexity with that range of flavors, not everything is well integrated; it could use a little bit of refinement. Still, it\'s fun to explore, and changes a little bit with each tasting, which keeps it interesting. Would we call this the best single malt from last year (factoring in value and availability), like the OSWAs did? Eh, maybe not quite, but it\'s not a terrible shout.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.8 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn\'t even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don\'t buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn\'t use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we\'ve tasted\r  \n10 - Can\'t imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we\'ve added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Individually the latter make terrible targets (and thus are not appropriate fodder for something like the OSWAs) because they come and go so quickly.

There are no details on age or cask type, but coming from Springbank distillery, we can expect a quality presentation and some characterful spirit.\r  \n\r  \n**Longrow Peated**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Campbeltown - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 80\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 88\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 10 months; bottles at 90%, 80%, 70% (blind tasting), and 60% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Smoky and peaty, like a green, earthy peat, with some wood smoke involved as well. The classic Springbank/Campbeltown funk is there: dank musty warehouse, damp hay, lightly meaty, like cured bacon, maybe some moss, with a touch of iodine. There's something slightly metallic as well, maybe coppery, as well as salt, cinnamon and vanilla, and a buttery roundness. Lower in the glass, we find some sharpness - it's a bit like a spirity ethanol note, which bridges into sharper lemon, some lime and orange citrus as well; lastly, a bit of sweeter prune.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium level of peat, and the mouthfeel is medium as well to go along with it. Not too harsh overall (despite a mild ashy smoke, or embers of a campfire), but really a nice mix of salt, oils, some sweet and some heat. The sweet comes in the form of lemon, rich apple, a bit of orange and lime; also butterscotch like Werther's Originals, and a red fruit later. On the other side, the heat or spice is from dry oak and jalapenos. To round it out, there is a nice meaty pork note, and it's earthy, yeasty, and has a baked bread note.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is medium-long, with peat lingering for a while; it's really the most dominant note at this point, though it's far from overpowering. Still, we find several other things in the background: some oak that morphs into a mildly bitter tannin, mild apple and candied lemon, dry hay, and buttered toast. There's a nice roundness, with a touch of youthful vibrance juxtaposed with some refinement.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Another good Campbeltown whisky, solid is most respects, but perhaps not standing out in any of them. There is that nice funk typical of the region, along with some earthy Highland peat, and some fruit lingering around; still, the youth in the bottle is hardly hidden, and while there is a decent complexity of flavors developed for what is likely a relatively young age, there isn't really anything that stands out and catches your attention.

Review #57 - Kilkerran Heavily Peated Batch 5,57,114q099,https://i.redd.it/t4iobw82vria1.jpg,1676649827,,"[{'body': ""**Review #57 - Kilkerran Heavily Peated Batch 5**\r  \n\r  \n*NAS Campbeltown Mini-Series: Part 1 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nToday we're starting a series about Campbeltown malts, one from each of the three main distilleries (Springbank, Glengyle, and Glen Scotia), which are not age stated. Now one of the most sought-after regions of Scotch whisky, these are generally considered high quality malts that deliver plenty of flavor with their (generally) natural presentation of 46%+ ABV, natural color, and lack of chill filtration.\r  \n\r  \nFrom Glengyle, we have the Kilkerran Heavily Peated, specifically the 5th batch in our bottle. While much of the Kilkerran range has much milder peat, this is supposed to represent their abilities when making a foray into smoky barley. Aged in ex-bourbon casks (85%) and ex-sherry casks (15%), this bottle should provide an array of flavors complemented by the smoke, and at a cask strength of 57.7%, there should be no shortage of those flavors.\r  \n\r  \n**Kilkerran Heavily Peated Batch 5**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Campbeltown - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 82\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 82\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 57.7% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: 85% Ex-bourbon, 15% ex-sherry casks\r  \n**Details**: Batch no. 5\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 1 month; bottles at 100%, 80%, and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Lots of your classic Campbeltown funky notes: damp hay, musty, machine oil, earth, lots of farmyard sort of flavors. Generally, past the earthy peat, it's a spirit driven experience: occasionally sharp, agave, mezcal smoke, just a hint of antiseptic cleaner. Still lots more notes coming in through the various tastings: petrichor, white grapes, dry driftwood, and some white pepper. There's mild buttery oak and some vanilla, some lime, some charcoal. The occasional coastal note can come through, too, like salt and seaweed, and we even found a barbecue note one time, like a turkey meat.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is medium, and it brings some oily flavors of hay, wet grass, and a touch of cream. Peat is stronger on the palate, a little sweet but also a little brittle at times, along with some wood smoke, too. Spirit forward once more, and you can tell that it's relatively young spirit, though not in a bad way, more the fact that it's vigorous; the sweeter flavors roll in, with orange soda, vanilla, cane sugar, butterscotch candy, and cinnamon-topped pears. To balance the sweetness, there is some paprika cooking spice, along with a bit of minerality, even potting soil; the longer this sits, the more the vanilla opens toward a heavier, creamier custard.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is medium-long, and along with some mild warmth from the bottling strength, there is plenty of peat that tickles the palate as it lingers, which occasionally brings back the agave or mezcal note. Can be slightly herbal or green and earthy, but there are plenty of wood flavors as well, like wood smoke, vanilla bean, campfire, white pepper, and the occasional acrid tannin. It ends with damp hay, pear, and just a dusting of powdered sugar.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is good. Did it blow us away, like we expected after reading many glowing reviews? Eh, maybe not that much, but it's still solid - we think with a little more time in the casks, this could be bumped up a few score points. It isn't quite like the heavy pungent peat you'll find from a lot of Islay single malts, but there is still a decent amount, and it's a nice twist on the usual Kilkerran profile. Each tasting struck us a little bit differently, which always keeps it interesting; this is a decent value, too, if you can find it (that's the hard part).\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.3 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #56 - Old Forester 1920,121,1131don,https://i.redd.it/9j51pfm9ldia1.jpg,1676476983,,"[{'body': 'Just a comment that your rating scale feels a little off when comparing to your notes. When I read this, it\'s hard not to think it\'s at least ""Good Neat"" which is a 7 on your scale.', 'score': 22}, {'body': 'Am I the only one that gets a banana bread note on the nose from one of these?', 'score': 11}, {'body': ""**Review #56 - Old Forester 1920**\n\nToday, a whisky that we've been enjoying for a few years now, one that shows there is still value to be found in higher proof bourbons. It's pretty much always available when we head to the store, and has gained quite a reputation for being a solid sipper.\n\nThe 1920 'Prohibition Style' refers to the bottling practices during Prohibition, when all whisky was to be bottled at a certain proof. The barrel entry proof was set at 100, and after maturation, the finished whisky generally came out around 115 proof, which is why the current bottling still carries this strength. That should give us plenty of flavor to look forward to.\n\n**Old Forester 1920**\n\nUSA - Bourbon\n\n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 56\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 57\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 57.5% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 16 months; bottles at 90%, 70%, and 20% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: There is decent sweetness here, and it comes in many forms: darker medicinal cherry, caramel, vanilla, and Werther's Original candies all come to mind, and maybe even molasses. There is plenty of rich oak as well, and it comes with some spices, such as nutmeg, or even some mild nuttiness. We get some dusty corn grain in there, and later on, along with a little bit of heat, there is a dark fruit like plum or prune, along with some sweet red wine.\n\n**Palate**: Oaky, lots of oak and spice, along with a decent bit of heat. The mouthfeel is thick and oily, with lots of candied sweetness, both caramel and cherry hard candies. There is cinnamon too, more like red hot candies, and after a while, a hint of tobacco smoke and anise spice. It ends with brown sugar and possibly a mild barbecue note.\n\n**Finish**: Nice and warm, with sweet fruit like plum, raspberry, and blackberry. Oily with hard candies, licorice, oak spice, maple syrup, and a little bit of anise. The finish length is medium-long.\n\n**Final Note**: We often get some cherry notes on Old Forester bourbons, and this one is no exception - it pops through in the nose, palate, and finish. We enjoy that note quite a bit, and paired with the nice oak and plentiful flavor from the bottling strength, this is just a solid all-round bourbon at a price 'closer' to entry level. A decent value indeed, we would recommend this to pretty much anyone looking from something with a punch and quality, along with some flavor development that generally surpasses the entry level stuff.\n\n**Average Rating**: 6.5 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\n\n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\n\n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\n\n3 - Low end mixing whisky\n\n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\n\n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\n\n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\n\n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\n\n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\n\n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\n\n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #55 - Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon,144,10yvrfz,https://i.redd.it/01ewslhixdha1.jpg,1676045250,,"[{'body': 'I like how almost every review of Blanton’s settles on “it’s fine.”', 'score': 36}, {'body': 'Queue the “Blanton’s is overrated, Im too cool for Blanton’s” comments', 'score': 91}, {'body': 'I don’t believe you. Can’t find goddamn Blanton’s anywhere. Yes I’m bitter lmao', 'score': 35}, {'body': 'I just saw this at O’Hare duty free for $139. Hard pass.', 'score': 14}, {'body': ""**Review #55 - Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon**\n\nToday we're looking at Blanton's, one of the most hyped yet still semi-obtainable bourbons on the market. While it should be priced around $65 according to the producer, it's not uncommon to see this upwards of $100, sometimes even closer to $200, depending on how bold the store selling it is. Because of the limited availability and premium pricing, the value here could be hindered unless we're really blown away by the taste.\n\nBlanton's Single Barrel Bourbon started back in the mid-1980s, and is said to be the world's first commercially available single barrel bourbon offering. Generally aged 6 to 8 years and bottled at a solid 46.5% ABV for the standard release, we can expect plenty of flavor and some refinement/flavor development based on the specs.\n\n**Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon**\n\nUSA - Bourbon\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 160\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 46.5% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 8 months; bottles at 10%, 50%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Pretty classic profile here - sweetness, plenty of cherry and vanilla, and a decent amount of oak. As it opens up, that wood turns slightly more dry, but other sweet notes come forward, too: mild caramel, raw sugar, brown sugar, and some pie crust. There is a little bit of dusty corn grain and old worn leather, and at the end, we're finding some wood spice and cinnamon.\n\n**Palate**: Medium mouthfeel, with plenty of oak up front, not as sweet at the nose led us to believe. There are some prickly tannins showing up at the back of the palate, but we also have nice sugar notes to pick through: maple syrup, molasses, boozy brown sugar, and caramel all come to mind. Once we even found a subtle watermelon note, but it didn't stick around too long. Generally speaking, well balanced and not too punchy.\n\n**Finish**: The finish is medium length, and there is mild heat with more of that dry oak from the palate. Light sweetness from brown sugar and baking spice, but the caramel has disappeared, leaving space for more of the dark cherry note from the nose. It's oily and makes the mouth salivate, and there is just a bit of puckering in the cheeks from the oak, maybe maple wood this time.\n\n**Final Note**: This is a nice sipper with a pretty classic bourbon profile and a few nicely developed flavor notes to dive into. Is it the most complex whisky on the market? No, far from it, but that isn't what it's meant to be, either. Is this a good value at the RRP around $65? Eh, maybe - we wouldn't mind paying that for it, but would be more comfortable paying $50 to $60. Would we be tempted to pick this up for the 'available' prices in our area, more like $100 or $150 or $200? It's a resounding 'no.'\n\n**Average Rating**: 6.6 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\n\n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\n\n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\n\n3 - Low end mixing whisky\n\n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\n\n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\n\n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\n\n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\n\n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\n\n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\n\n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\n\n**Value Rating**: 4.75"", 'score': 19}, {'body': ""What would everyone consider to be a fair price for the standard Blanton's bourbon?"", 'score': 9}, {'body': 'Whatever your opinion might be, you have to hand it to Blantons marketing.

Review #54 - Dalwhinnie Distiller's Edition 2020 Release,55,10x274m,https://i.redd.it/c5jgoutalzga1.jpg,1675871956,,"[{'body': ""**Review #54 - Dalwhinnie Distiller's Edition 2020 Release**\r  \n\r  \n*Distiller's Edition Mini-Series: Part 3 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nLet's wrap this mini-series up - it's time for our third and final Diageo distiller's edition whisky, this time from Dalwhinnie. We're looking at the 2020 bottling, which was distilled in 2005 and underwent double maturation, likely employing ex-bourbon and ex-Oloroso sherry casks (though those details aren't explicitly stated).\r  \n\r  \nOne point of interest here - Dalwhinnie is one of the highest distilleries in Scotland (supposedly the highest with a visitor center) at an elevation above sea level of 352 meters (1,154 feet). While some of their cask maturation takes place on site at this height, much of the whisky is moved elsewhere in Scotland for maturation (probably the central belt), so it's hard to say how much influence this change in conditions might have on the final product.\r  \n\r  \n**Dalwhinnie Distiller's Edition 2020 Release**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Highlands - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 115\r  \n**Age Statement**: 14-15 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Double maturation, finished in sherry casks\r  \n**Details**: Distilled in 2005, bottled in 2020\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 7 months; bottles at 50% and 40% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Generally pretty easy and soft, and quite the fruit bomb: sweet citrus, grapefruit, cherry, and lots of berry fruit in general, like raspberry and blackberry, even blueberry. Past the fruit, there is some vanilla and a bit of earthiness, along with a bit of ethanol, granulated sugar, and brown sugar.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Comes in stages: we start with lots of citrus and some sharper pepper up front, but then it evens out with some solid oak influence and wood sugars, along with just a hint of smokiness. Then the fruit turns red once more, but it's mild, and overall, this is a little hotter than expected for the strength; at least we get a medium thickness mouthfeel. Later, there is some barrel spice and nutmeg, along with lightly bitter tannins.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Bold finish, full of ex-bourbon notes like oak astringency and a hint of wood smoke. There are fruits like orange and berries, along with sherry; the whole experience is a medium length.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Not bad, but not quite as good as the other distiller's editions we looked at, despite the additional aging. Dalwhinnie is known for a more mellow style, which generally fits our experience, though we did find some astringency and heat in both of the tastings we did of this malt. Still, a decent sipper, though at the going price, we're not sure we would be picking up a bottle of this.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.4 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\r  \n\r  \n**Value Rating**: 6.07"", 'score': 4}, {'body': ""What is everyone's favorite Diageo brand or distillery?

Review #53 - Talisker Distiller's Edition 2019 Release,35,10snshv,https://i.redd.it/8memgieyxzfa1.jpg,1675440056,,"[{'body': ""**Review #53 - Talisker Distiller's Edition 2019 Release**\r  \n\r  \n*Distiller's Edition Mini-Series: Part 2 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThe second distiller's edition whisky we'll look at is the 2019 release from Talisker. Distilled in 2009, this was bottled in 2019 at the distillery's usual 45.8% ABV, with no statements about added coloring or chill filtration, as per usual with Diageo.\r  \n\r  \nThis release was double matured, presumably first in ex-bourbon style casks, but the second cask type is more unusual: Amoroso casks. Amoroso is a style of sherry with a relatively low volume of production compared to the more common sherry types like Oloroso; actually, it starts as Oloroso sherry, before it is sweetened, generally through the addition of some Pedro Ximenez sherry (the darkest, sweetest, syrupy type that tends to add red fruits and jam to a whisky). With this unique double maturation, we're expecting lots of dark fruit, as well as maybe some umami flavors with the usual Talisker sea salt notes.\r  \n\r  \n**Talisker Distiller's Edition 2019 Release**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Highlands - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 100\r  \n**Age Statement**: 9-10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 45.8% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Double maturation, finished in Amoroso sherry casks\r  \n**Details**: 2019 release, distilled in 2009\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 70% fill level at of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Full and round, quite rich overall. A dusting of peat to start, and a decent oak note; then it's savory, with some of that classic Talisker saltiness. There's hot sand, a bit of a beach barbecue, and some sweetness like a barbecue sauce. In terms of fruit, it's dark like fig and sweet blackberry, and we finish with a note of pulled pork.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Quite a bit going on here: strawberry and raspberry jam, along with black currant and some sweet raisins. There is a black pepper kick, and the peat is still more mild, and very coastal. Sweet and savory flavors battle back and forth, but it's generally well balanced; later, we get some sweet sauce, and it becomes slightly more delicate, as well as mildly oaky. The mouthfeel is a medium thickness.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is medium length, bordering medium-long; some peat and a bit of bitter oak hangs around, though that flavor is soft. Puckering around the cheeks, white pepper, and at the end, a bit of sweet fruity gummy candy.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Tasty stuff, we really like the addition of the Amoroso cask element.

Review #52 - Oban Distiller's Edition 2021,41,10qy9te,https://i.redd.it/z06afc39olfa1.jpg,1675267314,,"[{'body': ""**Review #52 - Oban Distiller's Edition 2021**\r  \n\r  \n*Distiller's Edition Mini-Series: Part 1 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThis mini-series will focus on some annual releases by Scotch distilleries - their 'distiller's editions.' In fact, all three that we will review are brands owned by Diageo, which has made a habit of these special releases on an annual basis with many of its distilleries - for better, or for worse. They vary in style, but often there are more uncommon casks used in finishing, and sometimes, these bottles come in at higher strength, too.\r  \n\r  \nThis week, it's Oban, specifically the Distiller's Edition from 2021. We generally like the whisky we've tasted from Oban, with a few exceptions, and would consider ourselves fans of the distillery if the pricing and presentation were a bit more reasonable. The delicate, fruity, sometimes flowery distillate is something to be enjoyed if the aging was done in the right sort of oak, and with the addition of Fino sherry casks in this release, we could be onto something special.\r  \n\r  \n**Oban Distiller's Edition 2021**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Highlands - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 125\r  \n**Age Statement**: 13-14 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Double maturation, finished in Montilla Fino sherry casks\r  \n**Details**: Distilled in 2007, bottled in 2021\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 70% fill level at of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Quite rich despite the bottling strength, plenty of oak and some sherry as well. There's leather, a bit of wood smoke to go along with it, and some red and orange fruit; then we get more ex-bourbon notes of vanilla bean and light caramel. We find overripe strawberries, sweet red apples, and later on as it has opened up, a bit of agave.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The mouthfeel is a medium thickness, and again it's rich in flavor like the nose. Some dry wood tannins to start, but soon we're into fruit and savory sherry tones, with a hint of sauce in there, too. There is spice, almost like a jalapeno or some cayenne, even smoke paprika; those wood notes from the beginning increase over time, and give a nice warming feeling.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length finish, and still a bit warming and cozy. The oak wood hangs around but the bitterness has subsided, it's softer all around; later, there is red fruit again, and it's nicely balanced between spiced and sweet.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is pretty nice to sip on, the richness is exceptional for the bottling strength of 43% ABV - it would be great to see what a cask strength version of this could bring. In our book, this is a little bit better than the standard 14 year, though it comes with quite a price premium as well (in addition to being harder to find). Because of that, value suffers a bit, so if you're on a more limited budget, the usual 14 year (or another brand entirely) might be the way to go - if you want to splurge a little bit, this could be worth it once in a while.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 8.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #51 - Michter's Single Barrel Straight Rye,47,10monfx,https://i.redd.it/jlt650iw0mea1.jpg,1674835928,,"[{'body': ""**Review #51 - Michter's Single Barrel Straight Rye**\n\nToday, we're looking at a rye whisky from Michter's, their standard US 1 Single Barrel offering. This was actually the first Michter's product that we tasted, several years ago now, and therefore our introduction to the brand - will this be a bottle that will keep us coming back for more?\n\n**Michter's Single Barrel Straight Rye**\n\nUSA - Rye\n\n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 39\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 41\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 42.4% ABV\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 12 months; bottles at 90%, 30%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: A decent amount of rye kick, in the form of black pepper, nutmeg, and chili powder (or maybe garlic powder); a little bit of ethanol as well, but mild in that respect. There is a savory side to this, a bit of barbecue, smoked ribs, and a barbecue sauce, or a sweet and sour sauce, which we enjoy. A few miscellaneous flavors here and there: wheat grain, yellow apples, and cedar, before the sweetness kicks in, coming from granular brown sugar and caramel. In terms of oak, it isn't harsh, and starts out mellow, though it grows in prominence with time.\n\n**Palate**: Sweet and spicy notes grow on the palate: baking spices, black pepper, caramel apple, and some lemon or orange fruit are present. Quite oaky now, and there is some heat coming through, despite a medium-thin mouthfeel. The barbecue from the nose is here but quite muted, and we get little hints of chocolate and white wine later on; some nice dynamic flavors, but might need a bump in ABV to showcase them effectively.\n\n**Finish**: The length of the finish is medium-short, and while still a little hot, there is a nice dry wood note to go along with it. Plenty of sweet notes here, too, like maple, chocolate, and some thinner molasses; still, the flavors trail off a little more quickly than we would like.\n\n**Final Note**: This one split us a little bit; that said, the longer we had it, and the more time the bottle was given to open up and air out, the more we enjoyed it. A pretty solid entry level rye in the end, with some nice spice and barbecue notes, which will vary by the barrel, of course. For us, the biggest item to address would be the ABV - there could be some killer bottles of this whisky given a bit more strength, which would increase the concentration of the flavors. The price still makes this a decent buy, though, and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend it around the $35 to $40 mark.\n\n**Average Rating**: 6.5 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\n\n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\n\n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\n\n3 - Low end mixing whisky\n\n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\n\n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\n\n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\n\n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\n\n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\n\n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\n\n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #50 - Westland Peat Week 2019,52,10l287p,https://i.redd.it/usxxqgr3r7ea1.jpg,1674662910,,"[{'body': ""**Review #50 - Westland Peat Week 2019**\n\n*Peated American Single Malt Mini-Series: Part 4 of 4*\n\nTo wrap up the series, we're headed back to Westland Distillery, where we find a special release in the form of Peat Week from the year 2019. It's the fifth annual release of their Peat Week series, and this one is a combination of 5 casks, yielding a total outturn of 1,083 bottles.\n\nWestland's website actually gives us a good amount of information about this bottling: it is made from Baird's Heavily Peated Distiller's Malt (from the UK), was matured between 3 years and a little over 5 years, and aged in the following barrels: two 1st fill ex-bourbon, one new American oak from Cooper's Reserve, and two refill American oak. It's still a little young, but we're hoping for a bit more complexity than the standard peated release from Westland.\n\n**Westland Peat Week 2019**\n\nUSA - Single Malt\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 300 online, but not realistically available\n\n**Age Statement**: 3 Years\n\n**Strength**: 50% ABV\n\n**Details**: Not chill filtered, no color added; 1,083 bottles produced\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 40% fill level at time of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: A big smack of peat, iodine, and salt on the front of the nose - this takes us straight to Islay, like a bit peaty single malt similar to Laphroaig or Ardbeg. Behind the peaty and medicinal notes, however, there is a lighter background, more like lemon and vanilla, even a hint of orange citrus. Lower in the glass, there is a little bit of barley or grain character as well.\n\n**Palate**: The peat is strong on the palate like the nose - it tickles the cheeks and tongue. There is some nice sweet lemon at first, but we quickly go in the direction of barbecue, something like grilled poultry on over the fire with a decent pepper kick. It's a little bit buttery, and there is a lingering red pepper flake heat; overall, the mouthfeel is medium-thick.\n\n**Finish**: Buttery and oily as it lingers into the finish, which is medium-long. Those lighter tones of lemon and vanilla creep back in, along with some orange rind, and the peat isn't too harsh now, it's just right. The oak influence here is soft, somewhat light and dry.\n\n**Final Note**: This is pretty nice stuff, it's a shame the release was so limited, and is nearly impossible to find now. We were able to try this at a whisky bar, and it didn't disappoint; it has a lot of character for a malt as young as 3 to 5 years, and the bump in ABV compared to the standard Westland releases definitely helps bring more flavor. If you get a chance to try it, we highly recommend it; it's unlikely we'd get a chance to buy a bottle, but if we did, we would probably be willing to pay $100+ for it without too much deliberation, especially with the way prices are going for quality whisky these days.\n\n**Average Rating**: 8.0 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\n\n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\n\n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\n\n3 - Low end mixing whisky\n\n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\n\n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\n\n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\n\n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\n\n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\n\n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\n\n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #49 - Kings County American Single Malt,10,10h1atr,https://i.redd.it/k5mb4ndf68da1.jpg,1674232218,,"[{'body': 'The peated bourbon was fantastic.', 'score': 4}, {'body': ""**Review #49 - Kings County American Single Malt**\n\n*Peated American Single Malt Mini-Series: Part 3 of 4*\n\nOur next stop in the USA is New York, where Kings County Distillery resides. They make a single malt with imported barley from Scotland, which has been lightly peated. There isn't any age statement on the label, but like many American single malts, we're guessing it is relatively young, especially if new charred oak barrels were used. The bottling strength is one good starting point here, though - we get 47% ABV, higher than the 46% that many people consider to be a quality bottling strength for single malts.\n\n**Kings County American Single Malt**\n\nUSA - Single Malt\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 67\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 47% ABV\n\n**Details**: Made from imported lightly peated Scottish malt\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 10 months; bottles at 90%, 60%, and 30% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Quite malty to start, a decent amount of grain, sweet barley sugars. Peat is light, not too pungent, and it's sort of grungy and rubbery in character. There is some fruit here as well, citrus like orange, maybe a slightly meaty orange; then some wood notes, like wood char and spices of cinnamon and nutmeg. Later on, just a bit of sulfur develops, maybe a hint of a wine influence is there as well.\n\n**Palate**: Malty and rubbery again, and the grainy barley sugar is one of the main focuses. Nice peat, a little stronger than the nose, but there is a little bit of heat to go along with it, too. Dry overall, dry oak and slightly bitter or astringent tannins, and once again that mild sulfur note comes back. It does taste a bit young, a decent amount of grainy spirit, but then some nice unripe nectarine comes in. The mouthfeel is medium-thin.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-short finish, light bodied, and some heat to go along with it - probably could have used more time in the casks to mellow out. There is some wood influence, along with a hint of red wine, nectarine, and some vanilla. We end with a bit of sweetness like peach ring candies.\n\n**Final Note**: This is alright, there are some nice flavors just starting out in the nose and palate with orange fruit and a bit of stone fruit, but this needs a little more time to develop in the cask. If over-oaking is a concern, perhaps some refill casks could help give this the time it needs to become more mature. Still, it has some tasty flavors, especially if you like spirit-forward and malty whiskies. If available for a reasonable price (we'd probably pay $40-50), it could be worth picking up.\n\n**Average Rating**: 6.0 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\n\n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\n\n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\n\n3 - Low end mixing whisky\n\n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\n\n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\n\n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\n\n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\n\n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\n\n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\n\n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #48 - ASW Tire Fire Cask Strength,8,10fb7gf,https://i.redd.it/jf4sdo3gttca1.jpg,1674058364,,"[{'body': 'Can’t say that the sound of acrid, bitter oak and burning rubber sounds appealing to me haha, but to each their own!', 'score': 6}, {'body': '**Review #48 - ASW Tire Fire Cask Strength**\n\n*Peated American Single Malt Mini-Series: Part 2 of 4*\n\nPart 2 of our series looks at a distillery in Atlanta, Georgia: ASW. This distillery crafts a number of different spirits, including bourbon, rye, single malt, Irish-style whiskey, and others like gin and vodka. One of the oldest distilleries in the Atlanta since the repeal of Prohibition, there is plenty of history here, which is reflected in their variety of whisky options. We\'re most interested in the peated single malt today, which they\'ve dubbed \'Tire Fire.\'\n\nThere is also a non-cask strength version of this whisky - it comes in at 45.5% ABV, which should still give plenty of flavor, but we want the full blast of smoke, so we\'re looking at the cask strength bottling. ABV will vary from bottle to bottle - ours comes in at 55.9%. The barley used comes from Inverness, Scotland, and is peated to 45ppm, pushing this easily into the \'heavily peated\' category, so it should provide plenty of kick.\n\n**ASW Tire Fire Cask Strength**\n\nUSA - Single Malt\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 60\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 55.9% ABV\n\n**Details**: Imported Scottish malted barley, 45ppm peat level; not chill filtered and no added color\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 9 months; bottles at 80%, 60%, and 50% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Well, they nailed it with the name ""Tire Fire"" - this is a massive blast of smoke and burning rubber, it seems pretty unique. Nothing held back - it\'s heavily smoked barbecue, wood char or charcoal, slightly medicinal, and just a ton of rubber notes. It can be hard to get past the obvious and powerful flavors, but once you do, there are some nice fruit notes here: orange, or some burnt orange peel, a red fruit, and stone fruit as well, though it\'s light. Lower in the glass, there is a bit of fresh oak and vanilla.\n\n**Palate**: Very punchy, a blast of peat and smoke again, along with some heat. We\'re getting charcoal, tar, burning rubber, and ashy barbecue; it\'s totally untamed. It takes some time to adjust enough to search the palate for more, but eventually you can expect some mild oak, butterscotch, and a sugary oil or some simple syrup; there is some lemon or orange citrus fruit, but it gives way in the end to a little bit of bitterness from the oak, it\'s slightly acrid. Turns more medicinal with time, and though it\'s harsh, it can be enjoyable, too. The mouthfeel is thick and viscous.\n\n**Finish**: Medium-long in length, and lots of smoke and barbecue go on the whole time. There is more oak now, both wood char and some dry toasty oak notes; vanilla and burnt caramel flavors are coming in from the casks, as well. At the end, there is some fruit, like a grapefruit, along with sugary orange candies, but it\'s sometimes masked by some acidity and bitter oak.\n\n**Final Note**: What an experience; we haven\'t tasted anything else quite like this. It is definitely harsh and visceral - this makes most Laphroaig bottlings feel pretty tame. The rubbery note is quite strong throughout, which will turn some people away, but if you\'re open to trying some new crazy flavors for a unique experience, this may fit the bill.

Review #47 - Westland Peated American Single Malt,14,10ay8za,https://i.redd.it/y7d9nz2a4uba1.jpg,1673626161,,"[{'body': '**Review #47 - Westland Peated American Single Malt**\n\n*Peated American Single Malt Mini-Series: Part 1 of 4*\n\nOur next series revolves around single malts, which is the category we review the most; this time, however, it\'s American single malts, as opposed to Scotch, which can sometimes dominate the category. We\'ll be looking at four bottles in this category, and this time, it\'s all peated spirit, so there will be several variations on the smoky whisky formula.\n\nThe first in the queue is the peated version of Westland\'s single malt - this will be smoky, but according to the distillery, the amount of peated malt in the mashbill is actually outweighed by unpeated malt, most of it grown in or around Washington state. There are a number of types of malted barley involved, too: Washington Select Pale Malt, Munich Malt, ""Extra Special Malt"" (whatever that means), Pale Chocolate Malt, and Brown Malt. This also has an unusually long fermentation time around 144 hours, which should lead to some more flavor development.\n\nThere\'s no obvious age statement here, but in the finer print on the back label, it does disclose that all of the whisky in the bottle has been aged at least 36 months, giving us a 3 year age statement - not surprising, especially if they were using new charred oak barrels, which will have a much more dominant impact on the spirit in a short time when compared to the refill/used barrels typically employed in single malt production.\n\n**Westland Peated American Single Malt**\n\nUSA - Single Malt\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 80\n\n**Age Statement**: 3 Years\n\n**Strength**: 46% ABV\n\n**Details**: Non chill filtered and no color added\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 8 months; bottles at 80%, 30%, and 20% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Peat smoke is pretty mild to start, and instead the stronger notes in the beginning are oranges and a bit of a red fruit. There\'s almost this wine finish note, like some sulfur with that red fruit, even a hint of a meaty quality; then we\'re on to a bit of red apple and lemon, occasionally a stone fruit, to finish out the fruit section. There is a nice earthy taste to go along with some green peat - it\'s even slightly vegetal at times; still, we get some clear young spirit notes in here as well: a bit of grain, barley sugars, some sharper pungent notes. We end with some wood char and spices like cinnamon and vanilla... overall, this nose is nicely put together for a young American single malt, there\'s plenty to explore.\n\n**Palate**: Peat smoke is immediately stronger on the palate: campfire smoke, a hint of ash, some mild meaty barbecue. That barbecue is more like dry rub as opposed to saucy, and it comes with a little more of that sulfur note as the palate opens up, some nice cozy warmth as well. The star of this palate, though, is wood notes: wood char, wood sugars, plenty of vanilla, and some white pepper are coming through. There\'s even bell pepper to go along with that white pepper, and then some fruity tones arrive, with bright orange coming to prominence. At the end, a bit of hot honey and some sharpness, and the mouthfeel is a medium thickness.\n\n**Finish**: The finish is medium-long, and oils and peat linger from the palate for a while. Ashy, smoky, and a bit savory, and lightly warming. Lots of orange at the end, along with some cinnamon, and just a mild dry oak note to finish.\n\n**Final Note**: This is a nice gateway to American single malts, especially the peated variety - if only all spirits aged only 3 years could be this nice and complex. Still, that does come at a cost; at $80 to $90 (at least in our geographic area), this is a bottle with premium pricing, and if you\'re looking for smoky single malts, there is plenty to be found in the world of Scotch at a more reasonable price. This whisky shows that the category of American single malts is developing quickly and moving in the right direction, but the value factor still has a way to go.\n\n**Average Rating**: 7.2 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Couldn\'t even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\n\n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\n\n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\n\n3 - Low end mixing whisky\n\n4 - Not the worst but don\'t buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\n\n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\n\n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\n\n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn\'t use in a cocktail\n\n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\n\n9 - One of the best whiskies we\'ve tasted\n\n10 - Can\'t imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we\'ve added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #46 - Nikka Miyagikyo Single Malt,15,1098dwt,https://i.redd.it/jwb1jeqcufba1.jpg,1673453315,,"[{'body': '**Review #46 - Nikka Miyagikyo Single Malt**\r  \n\r  \nHere we have a Japanese single malt whisky - an actual Japanese whisky, distilled and aged in Japan, as far as we know. From the Miyagikyo distillery, and bottled under the Nikka umbrella, this bottle of single malt is supposedly made of a mix of unpeated and lightly peated malt, which, along with gentle indirect still heating through steam, lends to a delicate and fruity character in the distillate. That\'s what the brand\'s website claims, at least.\r  \n\r  \nThere are actually some other Miyagikyo single malts, less common products released by Nikka, including a peated ""Nikka Discovery"" Miyagikyo Single Malt (2021 limited edition, bottled at 48% ABV) and a Miyagikyo Single Malt Apple Brandy Wood Finish (2020 limited edition, bottled at 47% ABV). We\'re looking at the standard release, though - how will it stack up with a slightly lower ABV of 45%, as well as no clarity regarding added coloring and chill filtration?\r  \n\r  \n**Nikka Miyagikyo Single Malt**\r  \n\r  \nJapan - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 92\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 100\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 45% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 13 months; bottles at 70%, 60% (blind tasting), and 50% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Somewhat light in complexion with a bit of citrus like lime, crisp Granny Smith apple, and mild peat; it\'s slightly coastal as well, with just a light salt crust. There\'s a definite vinegar note that we found in multiple tastings, but it isn\'t unpleasant - more like red wine vinegar, or apple cider vinegar. There are mellow wine notes, including tart white wine and white grape, as well as darker fruits like blackberry and raisin; a little bit of nuttiness like almonds, and some baking notes of cookies, cinnamon, and nutmeg. There are fresh greens, a slightly sweet hard candy, even a hint of margaritas at times, and overall, it\'s rather delicate.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Just a tiny hint of that peat again to start the palate, with a medium thickness mouthfeel, and it\'s a punch of flavor overall, though not overwhelming or harsh. Oils and buttery chardonnay start us off, along with light crisp notes that mimic the nose: honeyed sweetness, mild fruits like green apple and lemon, and that coastal saltiness comes back as well. Some heather or hay are next, and then it\'s on to wood notes: soft vanilla sugar, wood sugars, just a little bit of a tannin; later, we get more of a wood char or even a tiny dark sherry note, just something darker overall, almost hidden. It ends with that mild almond taste from the nose.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is medium length, maybe medium-short; somewhat soft and subtle, with just a hint of smoke, but plenty of vanilla and honey. The heather and hay notes are still there, along with some cinnamon, and at the end, just a little bit of darker flavor like prune, or overripe strawberries.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is pretty nice, a more delicate and complex malt to explore. We always love that light peat smoke influence, letting us know that it\'s there without being overpowering. The lighter sherry cask influence is great as well - it just gives hints of those dark, syrupy flavors at times while still allowing the lighter spirit and ex-bourbon style flavors to come forward, too. Still, we have to come back to the price... yes, a lot of Japanese whisky is quite expensive, and while stocks of this category are recovering after an explosion of interest, the prices aren\'t quite reflecting that. With a price around $90 rising to $100, you need to be confident you\'ll like it.

Review #45 - Redbreast 12 Year,63,104y1g9,https://i.redd.it/kvz3ivyb6gaa1.jpg,1673021505,,"[{'body': 'Nice review, RB12 is a staple of mine but think I will try the cask strength next time', 'score': 10}, {'body': ""**Review #45 - Redbreast 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \nOne of the best known quality Irish whiskies, Redbreast has been winning awards and gaining popularity over the past several years. Its most common bottling, the Redbreast 12 Year, is often cited as the best entry level single pot still Irish whisky - it is generally affordable, available, and gives plenty of nice flavors.\r  \n\r  \nThis was our entry into more serious Irish whisky, as well; we had tried some more basic bottles such as Jameson, but the Redbreast was the first step up into a realm of higher quality in this category. Still, it is bottled at 40% ABV, the bare minimum for whisky, and there is no indication of natural coloring or lack of chill filtration, so it's fair to say there is still a little ways to go before we can really consider this a whisky geek's bottle.\r  \n\r  \n**Redbreast 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \nIreland - Single Pot Still\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 65\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 60\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 40% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 13 months; bottles at 90%, 100%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Some nice refinement, with warm golden apple, some orange, and maybe a hint of a red wine influence as well; it's soft and somewhat clean. Lots of baking components: honey and a bit of spice like vanilla, cinnamon sugar, and brown sugar, along with biscuits and bread, maybe even oatmeal. There is a bit of oak in here, too, but somewhat mild and moist, not too dry; then we get into more fruit like sweet lemon and orange peel, just a bit of raisin. We end with some heather and a tiny hint of sulfur; it's a nice nose, but slightly subdued, probably due to the bottling strength, though it does grow stronger when given time to open up.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Gentle warmth to go along with a medium mouthfeel, and it is a little oily and rounded. Lots of different directions here; we'll start with fruit. Sherry fruits like plum, grape, and something red; also more of that orange rind we found on the nose. There's some sherbet up front as well, hard to place the flavor. Baking spices like vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and maybe cardamom, as well as baked goods like bread, though there is a hint of more raw yeast and grain as well. The oak is more subdued now, and despite the breadth of tasting notes, the palate can be slightly less rich than the nose.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length finish, soft warmth from sherry but relatively mellow. There is still a hint of that sulfur with the sherry, but we don't mind it; some stewed fruit as well, like raisin. Back on the baking theme, we get lots of vanilla, some soft cinnamon, baked bread, and some mild biscuits; during one tasting, we did get just a bit of a sour finish as well.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Nice and classy, if a bit subdued overall; that bottling strength really neuters it. Glad we have the option of the Redbreast 12 Year Cask Strength! Still, despite the tameness here, there are a lot of pleasant flavors to explore, especially if you enjoy the ex-bourbon cask sort of baking spices and some gentle sherry influence.

Review #44 - Compass Box The Peat Monster,63,1038jbv,https://i.redd.it/s9wjc2wk42aa1.jpg,1672851408,,"[{'body': ""**Review #44 - Compass Box The Peat Monster**\r  \n\r  \n*Peaty Blends Mini-Series: Part 3 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThe last review in this mini-series, and it's another blended malt - why didn't we just specify that from the start? Probably would have helped if we had noticed the trend. Oh well, hindsight is 20/20.\r  \n\r  \nHere we have The Peat Monster by Compass box; it's a blend of Caol Ila and Laphroaig, two of the most well know heavily peated Islay distilleries, and also probably the two Islay distilleries that send the most whisky to independent bottlers and blenders.\r  \n\r  \nCompass Box has made quite a name for themselves over the last ten to twenty years with their intriguing blends, interesting aging techniques, and a premium pricing placement. They're one of the go to brands for solid blended malts, peated or otherwise; they release numerous collectible special editions as well, and have quite a large portfolio of blends to pick from. Will this one live up to their name, along with the distilleries it originates from?\r  \n\r  \n**Compass Box The Peat Monster**\r  \n\r  \nScotland - Blend\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 61\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Details**: Blend of Laphroaig and Caol Ila; non chill filtered and no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 90% fill level at time of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Strong damp green peat up front, along with a little bit of charcoal, though it really isn't too ashy. There is some earth or petrichor, and a hint of green vegetation. Wood tones arrive in the fashion of pepper, along with a very milk oak taste, and there is a hint of lemon here as well. Hard to pick out more distinct notes after that - it's extremely cohesive, maybe even too much.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The palate is more peppery than the nose, both in terms of white pepper, as well as a bit of bell pepper. Medium peat level to go along with the medium thickness mouthfeel, and it's a little buttery as well, along with some mild vanilla. It's very 'blendy' again, as obvious as that sounds - 'smooth' despite the peat, and very rounded overall. There is a hint of citrus from lemon and orange, and at the end, a bit of wood char.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Heather and hay, a bit like a grassy field that is flowering; sweet honey, and the peat that lingers is mild now. It's a medium length finish overall. A little more pepper here and there, and at the very end, a touch of perfume.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is a decent blended malt, but we can't help but come back to the feeling we got on the nose - this is so cohesive, it can actually be a little boring. Maybe it's a sign of a brilliant blender when multiple single malts can be combined so smoothly, but it also cuts out a lot of the fun of finding unique and more challenging flavors that single malts generally deliver.

One might note that the tariffs and covid hit the Scotch business hard, so hard the industry calls it the ""lost decade"".

You have to be more carefully buying from resellers than in a peat bog.  You have been warned.

The 2021 Guinness cask was, again, ok and and totally IMO overrated,  but enjoyable decent product if you like beer (as was), and in reality it\'s now way overpriced by resellers. To me, the 2022 charred cask is much better, available and not over $100 in most place. I had three bottles, now down to two.   Everyone\'s taste is different.

Review #42 - For Peat's Sake,44,zxdkzp,https://i.redd.it/6f9lip7xyn8a1.jpg,1672244160,,"[{'body': 'It gets 10 out 10 for the name alone.', 'score': 8}, {'body': ""**Review #42 - For Peat's Sake**\r  \n\r  \n*Peaty Blends Mini-Series: Part 1 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nOur next series is some quick reviews on peated blends from Scotland - these are often widely available at a reasonable price, though it's possible to dive into this sub-category and find more rare and expensive options. Those won't be our focus this time; we're more interested in a few locally available options that could present some good value. Will these be like a classic smoky Islay whisky, but for half (or less) of the price?\r  \n\r  \nFirst up is 'For Peat's Sake.' Crafted by Angus Dundee distillers, this is actually a 'blended malt,' as opposed to just a 'blend' - unlike most blended Scotch, which utilizes a proportion of grain whisky to increase efficiency and provide cost savings, this is created exclusively from a blend of single malts. Considering that Angus Dundee owns the Tomintoul and Glencadam distilleries, we could expect some of those flavors involved; however, AD has long been an independent bottler, so they may be sourcing some of the makeup of this blend from other casks as well.\r  \n\r  \n**For Peat's Sake**\r  \n\r  \nScotland - Blend\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 22\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 40% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 20% fill level at time of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: So, there is some peat here, but it's a bit muted; some hints of iodine, and it can be slightly ashy, along with some seawater. Deeper down, there are citrus fruits of lemon and lime, but you have to look for it. As it opens up, more of a young spirit note grows stronger.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Quite sweet on the palate, more than expected given the nose. Lots of brown sugar, vanilla, cream - this feels like all ex-bourbon maturation. A hint of a corn note, maybe creamed corn, and vanilla grows stronger; the peat, on the other hand, is quite mild... it's more like a lightly peated palate. Mouthfeel is medium-thin.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The peat picks up a little bit in the finish again, and it all lingers for a medium amount of time. The other flavors disappear before that, though; there was sweet lemon candy, caramel, and again, that little corn note, maybe in the form of candy corn this time.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is alright, not bad for the price, but certainly no replacement for a real peated single malt. It's a bit muted overall, and might be a good entry point for people that aren't sure they like peated whisky; then again, many of the whisky drinkers we know took one sip of heavily peated Ardbeg or Laphroaig, and it was 'love at first sight.'

Review #41 - Laphroaig Lore,52,ztkh5j,https://i.redd.it/3vd3ksyp7o7a1.jpg,1671811293,,"[{'body': ""**Review #41 - Laphroaig Lore**\r  \n\r  \n*Laphroaig Wine + Peat Mini-Series: Part 3 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThe third entry in the series - we're finishing up with Laphroaig Lore. A non-age stated release, this one is supposedly a mixture of several ages and cask types: from 7 to 21 years old, and including barrels, butts, and quarter casks, as well as ex-bourbon and ex-sherry styles of cask preparation. Quite a lot going on there, so this should at least be interesting; whether or not it will be cohesive, that's another question altogether.\r  \n\r  \nFrom our reading of other reviews online, this bottle is pretty hyped up - will it live up to expectations?\r  \n\r  \n**Laphroaig Lore**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Islay - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 135\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 135\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 48% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon, quarter casks, Oloroso butts, others\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 2 months; bottles at 90%, 70%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Some stronger oak and charcoal, along with tar, rubber, and asphalt. Still, it's got a good sharp peat note as well, and already we get notes from the various cask types: it's slightly earthy, and then seaside notes of salinity, iodine, seaweed, and toasted kelp creep in. Lots of wood smoke, and that oak we mentioned is relatively dry, sometimes ashy. From the ex-bourbon casks, we're finding some icing sugar and hard butterscotch; next, it's into the fruit realm, with jammy raspberry and glazed strawberry, maybe a touch of prune as well. Citrus from oversweet lemon, and the more it opens up, the stronger an orange flavor gets, like sparkling orange soda. There is just a hint of a savory note, but it's hidden.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Pretty solid earthy peat note now, but far from the peatiest Laphroaig we've had; now that tiny savory note at the end of the nose has blossomed, lots of barbecue, charcoal, blood orange, and smoked orange rind. A bit like an extinguished campfire, and that smoke feels a little brittle (what does that even mean? Not sure, but it feels that way) and ashy. Sherry fruits of red and juicy purple fruit, sharper notes of tart lemon, and maybe some cinnamon from European oak; the mouthfeel can be just slightly syrupy, but overall it's a medium feeling, and at times can feel slightly watery. There is this medicinal chemical note in here - it's not acetone, not iodine, but something else; a little hard to place. At the end of the palate, we have some vanilla, and just a hint of chocolate-covered coffee beans.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long finish length, and while the peat is lingering all the while, it's never particularly harsh, but leaves a nice warming feeling. There is still some of that charcoal or extinguished campfire taste, but now a big orange flavor takes center stage, backed up by its citrus cousin lemon (tart lemon, maybe in the form of a preserve). A few dirtier flavors at the end: salt and earth, some grass or hay, a bit of wet oak; ends with just a bit of butterscotch.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Let's just get this out of the way - we overpaid for this bottle. Yes, prices are rising all over the place, but this was a painful pill to swallow. Still, we had heard so many great things about this whisky - why not splurge once in a while? Overall, this malt is a little more refined and reserved than most Laphroaig bottlings, more 'rounded' as opposed to brash, and there is definitely more layered complexity than most from this distillery. Some will enjoy that, and while we can respect it, it isn't the reason we turn to Laphroaig.

Review #40 - Laphroaig Cairdeas Port & Wine Casks,102,zrsdxs,https://i.redd.it/0fpgb8d9z97a1.jpg,1671638949,,"[{'body': '**Review #40 - Laphroaig Cairdeas Port & Wine Casks**\r  \n\r  \n*Laphroaig Wine + Peat Mini-Series: Part 2 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThis 2020 Laphroaig annual special release takes the second spot in this little series - this is Cairdeas Port & Wine Casks, bottled at a solid 52% ABV. As opposed to the 10 year sherry oak finish we reviewed last week, which employs ex-Oloroso casks, this bottle uses the fortified Ruby Port wine, as well as some other undisclosed ""wine"" casks; still, we\'ll be looking for some of those sweet, fruity, even meaty flavors. The port cask especially can add a bit of a syrupy chocolate note at times.\r  \n\r  \nThere has been some discourse about the quality of the Cairdeas bottlings over the last several years - some will point to varying quality, while it can also be difficult to compare as each release has a unique mixture of age, cask type, and bottling strength. Still, this release has the 2nd highest rating of any Cairdeas release in the last 7 years, at least according to the average of 500+ reviews on Whiskybase (whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/176213/laphroaig-cairdeas), so we should be in for a treat.\r  \n\r  \n**Laphroaig Cairdeas Port & Wine Casks**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Islay - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 130\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 150 (but not easy to find)\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 52% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon and ex-port casks, finished in red wine casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 13 months; bottles at 100%, 80%, and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Starts with some of that classic Laphroaig peat: sea salt, iodine, smoke and ashy cigarettes, which begins to transition to cigar smoke later. There is some dirty funky earth in there too, some damp plants, hay, a bit musty, or even wet rotten wood. Then it\'s on to some fruity notes, citrus from lemons and orange, as well as juicy darker notes like strawberry and chocolate covered cherry. In terms of oak, this has a mild influence, but it does impart some spice notes of clove and cinnamon; last we have a mild meaty flavor, charred like burnt ends.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: It\'s bold and rich, the peat is strong and full of iodine or medicinal sharpness. It\'s oily and warm, but not too hot - pretty balanced. Lots of warm mulled wine, orange zest, burnt orange peel, Christmas spices, and a bit of a cherry cola note as well; quite varied, but interestingly layered. Later we find prune juice, and more oak than before, though it isn\'t too dry, more charred, just generally tastes a bit burnt; there is warm cake and some salinity as well. At the end, there is a strong grilled jalapeno note, and the mouthfeel is a medium thickness.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Long finish, lots of oil, and the peat stays for a while, causing puckering in the cheeks - it\'s pretty strong. There is still some mild red fruit there, but this finish turns quickly to wood notes of charcoal, mild astringency, and bitter wood. At the end, it\'s more salty and ashy.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Another good one - this actually earns the same average rating from us as the 10 year sherry oak finish. Because of that, the price-rating value isn\'t going to be quite as good, since this costs almost 2x as much as the other bottle nowadays; still, if the combination of peat and wine casks is your preferred style of Scotch, this may be worth seeking out for its unique twist on the formula, as it adds a few unique flavors, including some nice dry notes in the finish (a little surprising considering the Port maturation).\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 8.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn\'t even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don\'t buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn\'t use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we\'ve tasted\r  \n10 - Can\'t imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we\'ve added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #39 - Laphroaig 10 Year Sherry Oak Finish,127,zni3ot,https://i.redd.it/zkoyvhjq9a6a1.jpg,1671206613,,"[{'body': ""**Review #39 - Laphroaig 10 Year Sherry Oak Finish**\r  \n\r  \n*Laphroaig Wine + Peat Mini-Series: Part 1 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThis next series will focus on one of our favorite combinations in the world of Scotch: peated spirit and sherry/wine cask finishing. Originally, we were going to do a series that included this combination from several Islay distilleries, but we ended up with enough bottles from Laphroaig to make it a standalone affair. Laphroaig is also one of our favorite brands in Scotch, so we don't mind spending some extra time with it.\r  \n\r  \nAs we mentioned, the combination of peat and rich ex-wine maturation or finishing is one of the standout styles of Scotch in our minds - it originally got us into the whisky hobby, via Lagavulin 16. Something about those dark smoky fruits, the seaside brine, and the meaty or saucy barbecue notes makes it irresistible to our palates, so we have ended up with quite a few of this type on our shelf. Each distillery does it a little bit differently as well, which makes it fun to continue to explore.\r  \n\r  \nLaphroaig's usual brine, ashy peat, and medicinal notes will add their own twist to the ex-sherry or ex-wine cask whisky formula, and we're excited to see how these sharper flavors interact with the often more subtle and deep cask notes. First up: the 10 Year Sherry Oak Finish, which takes the standard Laphroaig 10 Year, finishes it in Oloroso sherry casks, and bottles it at a more generous 48% ABV. Considering how tasty the standard 10 Year is, this should be a treat.\r  \n\r  \n**Laphroaig 10 Year Sherry Oak Finish**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Islay - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 75\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 79\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 48% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon and ex-Oloroso sherry casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 13 months; bottles at 100%, 75%, 40%, and 30% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Lots of rich, inky red and purple fruit to start out. It's strawberries, blackberry preserve, plum, and prune; even raspberry and cherry, a rich dark Luxardo cherry. There is a little bit of the citrus we find sometimes in Laphroaig, but now it's more like a charred orange rind, which is right in line with the barbecue notes and plentiful peat smoke. Freshly burned firewood, even bordering on ashy at times, and there is a decent amount of oak in this. That barbecue can come across like pulled pork at times, and others it's more of the wood smoke; there are a few lingering notes still, lots of layers to this. Sweetness from molasses and wood sugars, red wine, and a decent amount of salt, which moves toward a rubbery note. We end with just a bit of dark chocolate.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Mouthfeel is medium thickness starting out, and this is a bomb of red fruits, chocolate, and smoke. Cocoa or spiced chocolate, some milk chocolate covered acai berries, sweet raspberry, cherry jam, and glazed strawberries. The peat is nice and pungent, coming with some earthy and mossy flavors, and later some wood smoke and char as well; still, it's a bit more tamed and rounded than the standard 10 year release in that respect. Along with the wood smoke, the oak is contributing some vanilla, a bit of oak spice, and it adds a nice dry balance against the sweet fruits. There is a savory side to this, too - just a hint of barbecue, some orange fruit, and mulled wine. We finish it off with the classic Laphroaig characteristics of ash and coastal salt.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish here is medium-long, there is a little bit of astringency coming in from the oak tannins, it's a little bit more dry now overall. The peat hangs around for a while, slowly trailing off pleasantly, and is backed up by more of that wood smoke. On the sweeter side, we find lemon and orangey fruit, strawberries once again, and then it ventures into darker territory, dark purple dried fruits. Quite well rounded overall, and we finish with some sugary red fruit candies.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Nice, really nice, and for a solid price, too, considering where the Scotch market has gone in the past few years. Yes, $80ish is still expensive for a 10 year age statement, but this has sherry maturation and a bump up in ABV, and it is absolutely loaded with flavor; we would not hesitate to buy another bottle, and this has decent availability in our market, which always helps. Definitely recommended if you're into the peated profile, especially if you love that peat + sherry combination.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 8.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #38 - Whistlepig 12 Year Old World Rye,57,zluxp4,https://i.redd.it/rl6q1a421w5a1.jpg,1671034204,,"[{'body': 'I absolutely love the 12 year personally. It’s around an 8.5 for me. I get a mild but long hint of mint on the finish. The 10 year is very pleasant but there are better for cheaper. Those are the only ones I’ve tried.', 'score': 15}, {'body': ""**Review #38 - Whistlepig 12 Year Old World Rye**\r  \n\r  \n*Finished Ryes Mini-Series: Part 3 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nTo finish up this series, we're looking at an older rye, aged 12 years, distilled in Canada, though it's blended and bottle in Vermont. This is Whistlepig's Old World Rye, which mixes the traditional new oak barrel maturation with a combination of Madeira, Sauternes, and Port casks. The proportions of the whisky aged in each of the three finishing casks varies between batches; we've added our specific breakdown below.\r  \n\r  \nThis review's cask finishes come from a couple of countries: Madeira and Port are both fortified wine varieties hailing from Portugal, while Sauternes in a sweet wine variety coming from Bordeaux, France. There should be some sweet and dry tasting notes from these casks, though mostly sweet, so it's likely to be a dessert whisky affair.\r  \n\r  \n**Whistlepig 12 Year Old World Rye**\r  \n\r  \nUSA/Canada - Rye\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 102\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 140\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: New charred oak, finished in 63% Madeira, 30% Sauternes, and 7% Port casks (Percentages vary by bottle)\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 7 months; bottles at 90%, 100%, 80%, and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Tropical and sweet, and almost a bit moonshine-y to start. Lots of coconut, bits of pineapple, some sweet citrus juice, and candied orange peel start us out; then it's on to icing sugar, maple sugar, smooth light caramels, and a bit of vanilla. There is a great sweet, mellow oak note in here, ever-present and never overwhelming. After just a smattering of soft barbecue notes like sweet smoked meat, we get to the spice, which is plentiful and varied: cinnamon, mild black pepper, some nutmeg, and some chai tea notes as well.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Hard to know where to begin; there is quite a lot going on, even if the medium-thin mouthfeel doesn't allow a blast of flavor. In terms of spice, it's a little stronger than the nose, with nutmeg, black pepper, vanilla, and cardamom. There are sugars as well, plenty of sweetness: light brown sugar, icing sugar, and wood sugars. On that note, plenty of wood in general, strong oak, though again, it isn't overwhelming. Lots of baking notes here, too: cherry pie with the crust and some cake in addition to those spice notes. There is orange, light pineapple, red wine sangria, but also we find that tiny savory note once more, like black peppered barbecue, and mild leather.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length finish, still pretty mellow overall, just mild warmth to go with it. Plenty of oak once more, sweet, slightly delicate; just slightly astringent at times, before a wave of rich icing sugar and a bit of syrup. Citrus again, but not orange, instead some lemon and warm cinnamon, just a tiny bit of smoke to go along with it; we end with cool red wine and a tiny bit of moonshine once more.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: We were lucky to snag a bottle of this on a great sale here in the US (around $100); at its 'normal' price in our region, we've seen it sold between $130 and $170, which is steep. Not that it isn't a good whisky, it just isn't $150+ whisky. Still, beyond the pricing, this is tasty - the flavors are well-integrated, especially on the nose, though at times, the palate can't quite live up. A bump in ABV would definitely help, as it comes across a little thin, and more strength would help the finish last longer as well. Overall, decent stuff, but try to find it at a discount.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.5 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #37 - Barrell Seagrass,48,zh29fo,https://i.redd.it/32thtt99kw4a1.jpg,1670604817,,"[{'body': ""**Review #37 - Barrell Seagrass**\r  \n\r  \n*Finished Ryes Mini-Series: Part 2 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nPart two of our finished rye series focuses on a sourced whisky: Barrell Seagrass. This is a blend of Canadian and American rye whiskies, with no age statement given. Not particularly remarkable so far, but that's where the normalcy ends.\r  \n\r  \nIn addition to the usual new charred oak casks used for aging, this juice has also been in Martinique rum casks, Madeira casks, and finally apricot brandy casks. Some pretty unusual stuff here, so this might be quite a unique bottle; as it's bottled at cask strength, and unlikely to be chill-filtered, there shouldn't be any flavor held back, either.\r  \n\r  \n**Barrell Seagrass**\r  \n\r  \nUSA/Canada - Rye\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 93\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 85\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: Varies - Tasted at 59.20% and 59.92% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: New charred oak, Martinique rum, Madeira, and apricot brandy casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 12 months; bottles at 80%, 100%, and 50% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Very tropical and unusual right out of the gate: sweet rum and strong pineapple; light fruits like peach, white grape, golden raisin, and lemon. There is a little bit of heat here, but it's hardly a distraction as the flavors continue to roll in: lots of toasted coconut, brown sugar, a bit of wood spice, some dry vanilla, some bubblegum. We even get oily prunes, and later on, gummy bears and peach ring candies. This is very unique.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Sweet, and many types of fruit, a ridiculous amount of fruit really; it's a bit all over the place, but it works in a way. Dark fruits like plum, raspberry, and raisin; light fruits like peach, apple, apricot, nectarine, and oversweet pineapple, even concentrated pineapple juice. Honestly, this is so flavorful, it almost feels like a synthetically flavored whisky. Past the fruit, we're finding lots of creamy vanilla, coconut, Samoa Girl Scout cookies, white chocolate, and red wine; in terms of spice, there is a hint of rye kick like mild black pepper, as well as cinnamon, maple brown sugar, and a hint of dry oak. Closer to the end, it's Jello shots, syrupy and oily, before starting to dry out, finishing with a bit of Campari.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long finish, in part due to the mild heat, but also tons of oils hanging around from that thick syrupy palate. Still lots of stone fruit, and sweet notes from sugar, cream, and Sour Patch Kids candy, which is balanced by drying notes of clove and mild oak astringency. Finishes out with baking spices or biscuits.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Anything but subtle, and a ton of fun along the way.

Review #36 - Minor Case Straight Rye,45,zf4ys4,https://i.redd.it/zbql54mz1i4a1.jpg,1670429172,,"[{'body': ""**Review #36 - Minor Case Straight Rye**\r  \n\r  \n*Finished Ryes Mini-Series: Part 1 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThis three part series will focus on rye whiskies, specifically those that have spent time in a finishing barrel other than the traditional new charred oak cask. These finishing experiments will add some new flavors, especially some sweeter tones in general, which can be a nice complement to the spicy and herbal qualities inherent to most rye whisky.\r  \n\r  \nFor the first week, we're starting with Minor Case Straight Rye, hailing from Limestone Branch Distillery in central Kentucky. No age statement here, but it's believed to be around 2 years old, so lots of young rye notes likely incoming. The finishing barrel this time is ex-sherry, so we'll be on the lookout for some dark fruit tones as well.\r  \n\r  \n**Minor Case Straight Rye**\r  \n\r  \nUSA - Rye\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 45\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 45% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: New charred oak and sherry casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 1 month; bottles at 80%, and 70% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Quite a bit of orange to start out, candied orange rind and some rounded brown sugar and caramel notes. Sherry influence isn't too overpowering on the nose, though there are some slightly darker sweet tones mixed in with the classic fresh cask flavors of vanilla, sugar, and oak. Those dark fruits are grape and quite a bit of prune, and there is a soft spice added in, though it's mild.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Some sweetness from fruit, it's orangey and red as well, maybe a bit of unripe strawberry. Dried fruit is here as well, like sour grape, but we move quickly to the oak notes, which are actually relatively rich: sweet wood, anise spice, nutmeg, baking spice as well. There is just a bit of a sulfur note hiding in there, and later, we get some semi-sweet bread, as well as more heavy oak. Mouthfeel is medium or a bit more, with some oils in there as well.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: That anise tickle in the palate continues into the finish, though it gives way to red and orange fruit, orange juice, and just a hint of something purple like prune. A small amount of baking spice sticks around, and after some mild oak (which has faded into the finish), we again find just a whiff of that slightly bitter sulfur at the back end.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is decent, actually better than most ryes this young, at least to us. The sherry influence is definitely present, but not too overpowering; there is still plenty of influence from the original fresh barrels as well, with those classic sweet and spice notes. Worth a taste, especially if you can find this at a good price; this will become even more important when we look at the following entries in the series, as the prices on finished ryes can climb quite quickly.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 6.5 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #35 - Ardbeg Uigeadail,203,zaq5b0,https://i.redd.it/a83034ypei3a1.jpg,1669997602,,"[{'body': ""**Review #35 - Ardbeg Uigeadail**\r  \n\r  \n*NAS Ardbeg Mini-Series: Part 3 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThe final piece here: Uigeadail, coming in with a heavier sherry cask finish, believed to be Oloroso casks, though there is ex-bourbon aging as well. Like the Corryvreckan, this comes in at a sort of cask strength, now at 54.2% ABV. Winner of many spirit competition awards (we'll leave it you to decide how meaningful those are), this is also said to be the favorite whisky of the 120,000+ strong Ardbeg committee.\r  \n\r  \nGenerally, we love a peated whisky that also has some dark sherry influence in it; we love that barbecue, the spicy fruits, the thought of holiday foods next to a roaring fire. This was actually the scene that pushed us into the whisky hobby in the first place - in our first review, we mentioned a first tasting of Lagavulin 16 by the fire on a Christmas family visit, and it totally altered our perception of this drink category. With those memories so close to our heart, and the holiday season arriving once more, it's a great time to take a look at Ardbeg's offering in that realm, the Uigeadail.\r  \n\r  \n**Ardbeg Uigeadail**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Islay - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 86\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 86\r  \n**Age Statemen**t: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 54.2% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-Oloroso sherry and ex-bourbon casks\r  \n**Details**: Non chill filtered\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 12 months; bottles at 50%, 70%, and 30% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Big barbecue smoke and sweet sauce, and plenty of peat. Meaty, full-bodied and rich even on the nose, and with a dark complexion throughout the experience. In terms of oak, it's a medium influence, and a decent ashy note low in the glass; also some mild black pepper, and a dry campfire on the beach. Decently coastal, with brine and iodine, just a bit of funk, even a hint of formaldehyde; the longer the bottle is open, the more salty and medicinal it gets. Then we get onto the fruits: dried raisins and prunes, juicy strawberry, cherry, and plum; there is earthy fig, as well as a bit of sweet orange oil. We finish this section with some smoked fish, as well as cinnamon raisin toast.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Both sweet and dry, and a medium-thick mouthfeel to boot. Great strong peat and dry wood smoke, very rich, and lots of dark flavors again: barbecue, oils, caramel, barbecue sauce, black currant; dry red wines, prune, fig, meat, dry fruits in general. Sometimes that meat comes in as a dry-rub, sometimes it's more of a saucy filet. Sweetness grows as this opens up, and those purple dry fruits are ever-present. In terms of spice, we find a pepper prickle, some cinnamon sugar butter, and other baking spice; there is medium oak now as well, which transitions to leather and cigar smoke. At the end, it's a juxtaposition between heavy ash and cream soda.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long finish, lots of oil, just a bit of heat as well. Sweet sherry and red/purple fruit notes are balanced by mild peat, slightly more drying oak, and campfire smoke. It's plum and prune, molasses syrup, salt and vanilla, and at the end, some spiced red wine.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Close call for us between this and the Corryvreckan, but this Uigeadail narrowly edges the win. Something about that mixture of sweet cask influence and heavy peat is just so good, always a winning combination in our book, and it's quite well balanced in this bottle. Lots of flavors to explore, we could sit with this glass for a long time. As for the value - so far in our geographical market, this has not seen the same price increases as the Corryvreckan, which has gone up about 25%. Even at $80 to $90, this strikes us as a pretty good value, and if prices stay near their current level, we'll likely pick up a replacement when our current bottle is empty, which won't be far off.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 8.1 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #34 - Ardbeg Corryvreckan,120,z8w9yx,https://i.redd.it/3t72nlzka43a1.jpg,1669826716,,"[{'body': 'I tried this in Scotland and it was the absolutely best scotch ever.', 'score': 17}, {'body': ""**Review #34 - Ardbeg Corryvreckan**\n\n*NAS Ardbeg Mini-Series: Part 2 of 3*\n\nFor the second entry in this series of NAS Ardbeg core bottlings, we're looking at Corryvreckan. Named for a whirlpool near the Isle of Islay, this hefty bottle comes in at a 'cask strength' of 57.1%, so it should be packing plenty of flavor and smoke (not that many Ardbeg bottles lack those two things).\n\nA hot topic for debate in the whisky enthusiast community is whether we prefer the Corryvreckan or Uigeadail bottlings; with their different cask types and bottling strengths, each has a unique twist on the Ardbeg formula with some merit. Which do we prefer? We'll find out this week.\n\n**Ardbeg Corryvreckan**\n\nScotland/Islay - Single Malt\n\n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 96\n\n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 115\n\n**Age Statement**: NAS\n\n**Strength**: 57.1% ABV\n\n**Details**: Non chill filtered\n\n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 5 months; bottles at 100%, 80%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\n\n**Nose**: Big bunch of deep, rich peat up front, lots of wood as well, ashy wood; it can be just slightly acrid at times. Quite a bit going on here, notes are coming in fast: earthy, sea salt, lemon and orange zest, just a bit of green moss or seaweed; fatty sausage, oils, pepperoni pizza, wood smoke, dry white barbecue meats. The ashy smoke is really the star, it's like the remains of an old campfire, still just slightly warm - old wood, soot, light white ash, smoldering logs. Bit of butter, sawdust off the work bench, and spices like white pepper and chili powder. We finish up with just a bit of bouquet, slightly medicinal... wow.\n\n**Palate**: Punchy, rich and juicy, and strong peat up front once more. The medium-thick mouthfeel is full of ash, char or charcoal, mild oak which grows to medium influence, and some mellow tannins. Tons of that wood smoke, and again the remains of an extinguished campfire; there is a dry side, or even a bit of bitterness at times. Sharp tones of lemon citrus, which melts into lemon candies, along with a bit of butter. Light vanilla and sugars are there, along with some pepper, and at last we find a hint of that saucy barbecue, even ashy burnt barbecue.\n\n**Finish**: The finish is medium-long, lots of tickling peat hanging around, but the wood smoke actually begins to take over. Lots of ex-bourbon notes now, in the form of oak, dry vanilla pods, charred orange rinds, buttery lemon. There is a little bit of warmth still there, and after we get through some salt, there is oil, like an orange oil extract.\n\n**Final Note**: This is a very good whisky. So much going on - sometimes, almost too much? It can be overwhelming, and this sometimes comes across a bit hot. Still, with so many facets to explore, most people that like peated whisky will find something they enjoy, whether that's fruit, spice, or savory. This is also VERY heavily peated - it must be one of the peatiest whiskies we have tried, regardless of what 'PPM' ratings in this industry tell you. The ashy wood smoke accentuates the peat, and if you're into that flavor, this is a killer dram. This seemed to have some pretty active casks involved as well, definitely some first-fill ex-bourbon. Highly recommended if you can find it at a decent price, but unfortunately, this recently jumped about $20 to $25 per bottle in our market; at US$115 or so, there is a lot of competition, so we'll be having second thoughts about replacing this when it's gone.\n\n**Average Rating**: 7.8 / 10\n\n**Rating Scale**:\n\n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\n\n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\n\n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\n\n3 - Low end mixing whisky\n\n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\n\n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\n\n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\n\n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\n\n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\n\n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\n\n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\n\nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\n\n**Value Rating**: 6.71"", 'score': 15}, {'body': 'Try it with a few drops of water!

Review #33 - Ardbeg An Oa,152,z4elwt,https://i.redd.it/7hiac50tw32a1.jpg,1669386292,,"[{'body': ""**Review #33 - Ardbeg An Oa**\r  \n\r  \n*NAS Ardbeg Mini-Series: Part 1 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nFor our next series, it's time to take a look as some of Ardbeg's core range releases, specifically those without an age statement. While the reliable 10 year old and fiery 5 year old Wee Beastie are good value picks and always available, it's becoming increasingly common in the last few years to see An Oa, Corryvreckan, and Uigeadail on the shelf as well. These are all quite popular, so we'll do a quick comparison and see which comes out on top for our specific tastes.\r  \n\r  \nArdbeg has been a family favorite brand since we first discovered heavily peated whisky, and while some of us have moved on to other taste preferences over time, there are generally still several bottles from this brand on our shelf. With the trend in the industry of embracing NAS bottlings now, and a reduction in age stated releases as stocks of old whisky are strained due to huge demand, the Ardbeg core NAS releases have become mainstays for us.\r  \n\r  \nAn Oa, named for the Mull of Oa, a rocky peninsula on the Isle of Islay, is supposed to show a more approachable side to Ardbeg when compared to its stronger siblings. Still, according to the brand, we can expect a dram with smoky power, plenty of fruits, sweets, and spices, and a rounded and balanced experience.\r  \n\r  \n**Ardbeg An Oa**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Islay - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 60\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 52\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 46.6% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: PX, Virgin Oak, Ex-bourbon, and 'others'\r  \n**Details**: Non chill filtered\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 12 months; bottles at 50%, 70%, and 60% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Coastal peat and barbecue smoke start us out, though it's far from overpowering. There's barbecue sauce mixed with fruits of berry and plum, and a little bit of orange; later, the fruits are even sweeter and more green and yellow, as well as a touch of steak seasoning spice. Bit of salt and oil, not too oaky, and some grass and semi-dry hay are here as well, and we can't forget to mention the minerality, with a bit of petrichor. Lighter complexion, baked bread, and sweet stone fruit like peach or nectarine finish us out.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Oily and peppery on the palate, hotter than expected at first, with jalapeno and savory smoke. Peat is moderate or a bit more, and with that smoke comes the familiar dry-rub barbecue, as well as cinnamon red hot candies. Later, the fruit comes back, in the form of blood orange, sweet green fruit like lime, and a green pepper. There is some drying oak, hints of wood spice and baking spice light clove or nutmeg, some honey, and one time, a just a bit of peanut. The mouthfeel is a medium thickness.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length finish, which got longer as the bottle was opened for more months. The smoky peat trails off nicely, and the oak tingle that hangs around is somewhat mild. Just a hint of that barbecue once more, and we find smoked paprika, fresh green vegetation, and a fruit that's hard to place, maybe stone fruit. It's somewhat oily and slightly coastal, too.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Good stuff, but the finish didn't always quite live up to the tasty nose and palate. That said, we can definitely recommend this bottle, especially if the pricing stays reasonable as it seems to be (for now). Barbecue is a hallmark flavor for us when it comes to Ardbeg, and this one delivers, along with plenty of complexity and other notes.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.6 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Due to the use of the Lincoln County Process, as with most Tennessee whiskies, we may expect to find a 'smoother' experience here, along with a bit of sweetness and a bit of wood smoke.\r  \n\r  \nThere's no age statement here, but it's generally believed to be from barrels that are five to six years old, so we can expect some more character than the standard black label bottlings will provide. With a bottling strength bumped up to 47% ABV as well, it's looking good so far.\r  \n\r  \n**Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Select**\r  \n\r  \nUSA - Tennessee Whiskey\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 48\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 47% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 100% fill level at time of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Rich oak notes, and lots of the classic American profile: sugars, hints of cherry, some wood spice, and wood sugar. There are bits of anise as well, hidden slightly away, and a tiny bit of black pepper. Later, we find an herbal note, a bit like eucalyptus.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Mouthfeel is medium-thin, and the palate is more spicy - black pepper and anise are stronger here, and the cherry becomes more muted, as well as slightly more medicinal. There are new spices as well, in the form of licorice, and then some fruit like grape and mild candied strawberry. We finish off with more oak and brown sugar.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: A medium length finish, and more sugar and vanilla as it goes on. The sweeter notes are stronger here than the spiced palate, but we still find a bit of that licorice.

One of the most well-known single malt brands, and one that many consider to be an iconic luxury brand (a perception that sometimes changes over the course of a whisky journey), this is known for showing up in many movies and television series, as well as plenty of other marketing ploys.\r  \n\r  \nSomething that comes with that recognition is changes in price, from both the producer and the distributors/storefronts. Macallan of any age has become something of a collector\'s item, and while current 12 year bottlings are available now for ""only"" $65 to $90 depending on the cask type used in aging, a 12 year bottling from a few decades ago can easily go for $500 to $1,000. This celebrity status has been creeping into the current year bottlings as well, with price hikes seen across the board, making it harder to consider these malts any sort of value proposition.\r  \n\r  \n**Macallan 15 Year Double Cask**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Speyside - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 155\r  \n**Age Statement**: 15 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 20% fill level at time of review.

There is some mild oak in there, but that\'s musty as well, and some damp green earthiness accompanies it. Quite rich overall, and there are dried fruits of fig, orange, and then a bit of citrus. Not too sweet, and as this opens up further, the dried fruit turns to plum and raisin and grows stronger.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: On the palate, that musty sherry note is again the first thing that comes to mind, and it\'s a bit dominant here. On the dry side but not quite bitter, and there are fruits of sweet fig and dry plum. The mouthfeel is medium.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length finish as well, but sometimes bordering on short. Warm fortified wine is there all the time, nice and soft, but still packing some flavor. In addition to the dried fruit, we\'re now finding some baking spices near the end of the finish.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This feels a bit more nicely balanced than the 12 year old bottlings from Macallan, which is nice. The flavors here aren\'t particularly uncommon, but it does them somewhat well. There is some subtlety, but overall, with the absurd rising prices on Macallan bottlings in recent times (not that they were ever cheap), we\'re unlikely to buy a bottle of this when we can get more flavor elsewhere for less money.

Review #30 - Glenlivet 18 Year,79,ywyd8m,https://i.redd.it/7885hxvrbc0a1.jpg,1668616424,,"[{'body': ""**Review #30 - Glenlivet 18 Year**\r  \n\r  \nThe most-sold Scotch single malt whisky in the world over the last year or two, and with the largest production capacity in Scotch malt (tied with Glenfiddich, roughly, around 21,000,000 litres per annum), Glenlivet is no doubt one of the giants of Scotch whisky. A couple of reasons this distillery still enjoys its status are its reputation for nice, easy-sipping malts, as well as its vast number of releases.\r  \n\r  \nThis is one of the core range offerings from Glenlivet, the 18 year old. According to the brand's website, we should be expecting some tropical flavors from the American oak (likely ex-bourbon), as well as a bit of spice contributed by some ex-sherry casks. With its lower bottling strength, will it be able to deliver?\r  \n\r  \n**Glenlivet 18 Year**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Speyside - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 125\r  \n**Age Statement**: 18 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 40% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: First-fill American, second-fill American, and ex-sherry casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 80% fill level at time of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: There is a little bit of wine influence there; some red or orange fruits, along with a very light sweetness. We find chocolate chip cookies, some other baked goods that are hard to place, and a little bit of plain chocolate. The oak is mild, and in terms of fruit, we're now getting orange zest, some sweet pear; it's light in general.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Cooling mouthfeel, and the thickness is on the thin side. There is just a bit of heat that builds later, but still quite mild; in terms of flavors, there is a bit of green plant and green fruit, some pear masked by a saucy red apple, and slight bitterness arriving from wood tannins. It's somewhat dry overall, which is nice, and while mellow and slightly watery, we do find a hint of a savory note later.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish here is medium-short, arriving with some fortified wine notes, but they trail off before too long. Mellow and a bit subdued, soft overall, and later we find tart pear and a small dry oak note.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This wasn't bad, per se, but just alright. Because of the low bottling strength, it does indeed suffer a lack of engaging flavor; we would love to see this bumped up to at least 46% ABV, but because of the lighter spirit style from the distillery and mostly ex-bourbon aging, something in the realm of 48% to 50% might really start to show the quality here. It's generally what we've come to expect from Glenlivet: solid, without too many glaring 'faults,' but not terribly interesting. Good for an entry level (or early whisky journey exploration) whisky, but not inspiring compared to many 18 year old bottlings from Scotland.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 6.3 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #29 - Bruichladdich Octomore 13.3,125,ysfi5y,https://i.redd.it/e32zlk7encz91.jpg,1668184481,,"[{'body': ""**Review #29 - Bruichladdich Octomore 13.3**\r  \n\r  \n*2022 Octomores Mini-Series: Part 3 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nTo finish this series, it's time for the '.3' version of the 2022 Octomore: 13.3, with its rarer barley makeup. Like the other versions, this is Concerto barley, but this batch was grown on Octomore Farm on the island of Islay, and then peated to 129.3 PPM before fermentation and distillation.\r  \n\r  \nThe casks here are also interesting; it's a combination of 3 types: (1) ex-bourbon, (2) Rivesaltes, and (3) red wine from Ribera del Duero. Rivesaltes are generally sweeter fortified wines hailing from southern France, and Ribera del Duero is from central Spain - both red and white wines are produced here, but this Octomore bottling is employing the red variety for its aging. Will we find any terroir-driven differences in this malt, or will the cask types be the predominant differentiating factor?\r  \n\r  \n**Bruichladdich Octomore 13.3**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Islay - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 260\r  \n**Age Statement**: 5 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 61.1% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon, Rivesaltes, and Ribera del Duero red wine\r  \n**Details**: Concerto barley, peated to 129.3 PPM, from Octomore Farm on Islay\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 90% fill level at time of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Lighter and cleaner notes to start, we have white wine and pear, along with plenty of white chocolate. Dry, unsweet vanilla, dry wood, and some lemon-lime are added, but as it opens up, there we find damp hay and some slightly musty notes. Black pepper and mild peat smoke, and the longer this rests, the more it changes toward sweeter vanilla, even creme brulee or vanilla bean ice cream. At the end, we do get just a hint of something more savory, like a lemon pepper steak.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Nice and creamy, actually, with a medium-thick mouthfeel and plenty of oil. Rich wet oak, vanilla, and more of that creme brulee from the nose, and the warmth here starts mild but builds to medium. At the same time, our peat influence is medium level at first, but grows quite strong the longer it's on the tongue, though it never really overpowers the other notes. Later, there is a hint of orange cream soda, some lemon zest, and again, that tiny barbecue char note finds it way in at the end.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is slightly more dry, and quite long; there is still some cream and burnt sugar, lemon - this is like an overcooked lemon tart pastry. Hints of white pepper and pear come back, and it's oily and plenty of peat. Later, wood char and wood smoke come into play, and at the end, a very pronounced tobacco/cigar smoke builds in strength.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: For us, this is the best of the bunch this year - more reserved and on the beaten path than the unusual 13.2, but also far more complex and full of interesting flavors when compared to the 13.1. The juxtaposition of the heavy peat smoke with the creamy sugar and lemon notes is fantastic, and that cigar smoke at the end is always a welcome treat. This might be one to seek out if you're looking to splurge on a special release bottle; still, the going price makes it pretty difficult to call this any sort of 'value' pick.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 8.3 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #28 - Bruichladdich Octomore 13.2,129,yqo4xr,https://i.redd.it/uu46v6zneyy91.jpg,1668012050,,"[{'body': ""**Review #28 - Bruichladdich Octomore 13.2**\r  \n\r  \n*2022 Octomores Mini-Series: Part 2 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nPart two of our 2022 Octomore series, this time looking at 13.2. Like the prior bottle, this was made from Concerto barley from the Scottish mainland, peated to 137.3 PPM, and aged for 5 years before bottling, but the casks used for aging here make all the difference.\r  \n\r  \nThe '.2' releases are generally aged in some sort of ex-wine barrels, and this year, it's Oloroso sherry casks from Bodegas Rey Fernando de Castilla. We'll be looking for some darker, fruitier flavors this time, maybe even a savory notes if we get lucky.\r  \n\r  \n**Bruichladdich Octomore 13.2**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Islay - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 250\r  \n**Age Statement**: 5 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 58.3% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-Oloroso sherry from Fernando de Castilla\r  \n**Details**: Concerto barley, peated to 137.3 PPM \r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 90% fill level at time of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Quite unusual here starting out, it's much more savory than the 13.1. There is plenty of prune and fig, lots of dark fruit, but then this funky meat comes in. It's like hard salami or Cajun sausage, and there is a definite lactic note joining in as well, all of which is lightly covered in mild peat smoke. Past the savory bits, there is a light hint of lemon, some barrel char, purple grape, and more dark jammy notes, like a blackberry jam. We end here with lots of funky fortified wine.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Some ethanol to start out, and the mouthfeel is thick. The obvious peat influence is still a medium amount, not overbearing, but it does start to build as the palate develops. Dry fruits are the star of the show, very dry in fact, and then that funky red wine comes back, like bottles in a moist cellar. It's tingly, salty, and then those savory meat notes return, even a hint of something rotten at times. There is black pepper, and something fermented... later, sliced pickles.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium long finish, and the peat smoke is plenty strong now. Lots of notes on the finish mirroring the palate: funky meat, even rotting meat, lactic notes, black pepper. On the sweeter side of things, we find red and purple fruit jams.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Not too sure about this one; one of the two of us found it interesting to explore, while the other was put off by some very unusual flavors. The lactic note is classic Bruichladdich, and interesting enough to experience on its own, but paired with the funky savory notes, we can understand how it would be a bit off-putting. Still, it's an interesting one, at least worth a try before we could consider buying a bottle.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.3 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\r  \n\r  \n**Value Rating**: 4.60"", 'score': 14}, {'body': ""Just a note to anyone thinking of buying a 13.2 in the UK, it's all sold out.

Review #27 - Bruichladdich Octomore 13.1,206,ym1d21,https://i.redd.it/s4bod3yr8yx91.jpg,1667574243,,"[{'body': ""**Review #27 - Bruichladdich Octomore 13.1**\r  \n\r  \n*2022 Octomores Mini-Series: Part 1 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nA quick mini-series here, this time looking at the current year's releases of Octomore from the Bruichladdich distillery. We'll take a glance at each one of this Islay distillery's 'super heavily peated' malts from 2022 and determine how they stack up (at least in our opinion).\r  \n\r  \nOne of the things we love about Bruichladdich is their transparency: for years now, they've been publishing some of the secrets behind their whisky-making process, often right on the bottle itself. The Octomore series is no exception; nowadays, it general consists of three versions each year with some general similarities year to year, the '.1,' '.2,' and '.3.' Each type has its own quirk which contributes to the flavor in a unique way. Some of these qualities can be found on the unique bottles used for these releases, but there is plenty more information available on the distillery's website.\r  \n\r  \nIn this first review, we'll look at the '.1' bottling, which is generally aged in ex-bourbon casks. This year, it has a twist: after being aged nearly 5 years in first fill ex-bourbon casks, it was then moved into another new set of first fill ex-bourbon casks for finishing. We get the usual barley provenance information as well, this bottling made from Concerto barley grown on the Scottish mainland, which was then peated to 137.3 PPM before distillation.\r  \n\r  \n**Bruichladdich Octomore 13.1**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Islay - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 230\r  \n**Age Statement**: 5 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 59.2% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon\r  \n**Details**: Concerto barley, peated to 137.3 PPM \r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 100% fill level at time of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Hay and apple to start out, more mellow flavor notes than the .2 and .3 bottlings, but there is still a lot of peat on this nose. It's earthy and a bit green, with a touch of vanilla, cream soda, white pepper, and dry wood coming in from the casks. Then the Islay characteristics fight back with moss and some medicinal notes in moderation, and later on, after given time to open up, white grape and vanilla ice cream take over.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: This is more peppery up front on the palate, and it's oily and has a medium-thick mouthfeel. Not too warm at first, but that heat does come in later, and there is a decent dry oak tingle to go along with it. Peat is here, of course, but actually isn't very overwhelming, instead being overshadowed by lots of buttery oil, dry wood, and a touch of nutmeg. There's something just slightly savory here, too, hard to place, and all the while, we're still getting a ton of pepper, both black and white. We finish off the palate with a very faint vanilla bean.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Buttery and oily again, and this is a medium length finish. The peat actually drops away a little bit, but the pepper notes linger; in the end, it's the smooth butterscotch note that stays the longest.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Good complexity here for a malt that's merely 5 years old; probably doesn't hurt that it comes in at cask strength, especially from a distillery that is known for a lot of character in their new make spirit. We're glad this isn't too sweet for a spirit with quite a bit of first-fill bourbon cask influence, and this is pretty well balanced, if a little bit spicy on the palate. Overall, a solid start to the range, but the price for these bottles is always a hard pill to swallow. A good whisky? Yes. Good value? Not even close.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.8 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Some say newer bottlings are ""inferior"", but I think everyone likes to say that about anything when their memory can\'t quite be trusted.\n\nI also am guessing it might mainly be due to me buying Uigedail first, loving it, then jumping into Corry shortly after and often trying them back-to-back with each other and with other favorites (Laphroaig, Lagavulin, Ledaig - most of the ""big"" heavy peaters, and some sherried cask strength numbers like Arran).\n\nOverall I guess I just fell in love with the deep dark ashy smoke of Oogy paired with it\'s sherry-sweet undertones. I just couldn\'t get the same complexity out of Corry. I know opinions are divisive on each and it\'s almost become a team Oogy or team Corry at this point, so maybe I can see why that is at least.

I had no idea this is what they did but I was game for trying. I tasted a few and came home with one that tastes almost more like wine than beer, and that is very opposite my usual style.

I'd love to sample them and dig more up about them as I always have heard good things but wasn't sure where to start... so I grabbed a longtime favorite in the Ledaig 10 (have yet to find the 18 though!), and also grabbed a 2-pack of Innis & Gunn Laphroaig cask just to give them a whirl.

Review #26 - Jameson Irish Whiskey,54,ykamnl,https://i.redd.it/r6stdhnujkx91.jpg,1667408472,,"[{'body': ""**Review #26 - Jameson Irish Whiskey**\r  \n\r  \n*NAS World Whisky Mini-Series: Part 4 of 4*\r  \n\r  \nTo wrap up our world tour, we're stopping off in Ireland for a visit with Jameson Irish Whiskey. Distilleries in this country like to triple distill their whiskies, sometimes leading to a cleaner, crisper, more refined style; these are some of the characteristics that have led to this bottle being one of the most recognizable, popular brands in the category of Irish whiskey around the world.\r  \n\r  \n**Jameson Irish Whiskey**\r  \n\r  \nIreland - Triple Distilled\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 23\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 40% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 5 months; bottles at 90% and 30% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Rich golden apple, soft and nice overall, a bit light. There is decent sweetness here; we find it in the form of honey, crisp vanilla bean, green apples now, vanilla ice cream, and a bit of icing sugar. There is just a hint of a pleasant wood influence, but it isn't harsh or tannic at all. Then we're into the baking theme: warm bread rolls, nutmeg and cinnamon... still, somewhat clean overall.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Soft and cool, and the mouthfeel here is on the thinner side, it can come across a bit watery at times. Again, plenty of light, thin honey, some vanilla, and tons of apple, but it's slightly less sweet now - more balanced. After that, there is some butterscotch, and it's more bready.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Finish is medium-short, somewhat clean and nice; pretty easy. There is just a bit of warmth to go along with some light oak, but no real astringency here. Still sweetness from honey and mild apple, and then more oak vanillin comes into play at the end.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: One of the best all-purpose whisky mixers here. It isn't going to impress many with its flavors or strength, but it does blend well into many types of cocktail, as well as with soda or ice. Generally, we aren't drinking this neat, but it's a decent value pick, so we sometimes keep it around for cocktails with friends and family.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 5.3 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\r  \n\r  \n**Value Rating**: 7.24"", 'score': 12}, {'body': 'I have probably consumed more Jameson than any other distilled spirit.

A budget option, especially in the realm of Japanese whisky which has become very expensive due to high demand and years of low production, this bottle has potential to provide great value if the flavors can keep up.\r  \n\r  \nWe're tasting this neat for our review, but it is also a popular drink for mixing - the brand itself recommends this one in a highball. Before we get on to the tasting notes and the rest of it, we can go ahead and tell you - yes, this does make a tasty whisky highball.\r  \n\r  \n**Suntory Toki**\r  \n\r  \nJapan - Blend\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 31\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 31\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 5 months; bottles at 100%, 90%, and 60% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Balanced and relatively light. Orchard fruits start us out, lots of sweet green apple and underripe pear, followed by lemon and even a hint of lime citrus. Later, the apple becomes candied with caramel, and it's dusted with brown baking spices. There might even be a dark grape hiding in here, but you have to look for it. Past the fruit, we're finding confectionary sugar, honey, and then some environmental tones of salty brine, damp vegetation, and some mild dry driftwood. There might even be a hint of smoke on this, but it is very light.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: More caramel and spice on the palate, and more oily than the nose suggested, though it's a medium, maybe medium-thin mouthfeel. Red delicious apples, green apples, and pears, too; the sweetness from the fruits in balanced by some spice and oak dryness, though. There is cinnamon, clove, some wood sugar, a bit of toast as opposed to char. A touch of red wine once in a while, pleasantly warm, and we do find just a whiff of smoke as well, but it comes and goes. We end here with a hint of green vegetation and just a bit of a thin 'moonshine' sort of taste.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is medium length, and it falls away a little bit. It's light, mildly warm, with some light wood sugars and a very tame tannin as well; this errs on the sweet side later with mild apple and sweeter baking spices like cinnamon and cardamom. It's rounded out with a bit of biscuit and butter.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Color us impressed.

Review #24 - Navazos Palazzi Grain Whisky,7,ye3m4b,https://i.redd.it/xrd371h7p6w91.jpg,1666804914,,"[{'body': ""**Review #24 - Navazos Palazzi Grain Whisky**\r  \n\r  \n*NAS World Whisky Mini-Series: Part 2 of 4*\r  \n\r  \nHere's our second whisky in this series: Navazos Palazzi, coming out of Spain. A country not known in the whisky industry for its liquor production, but rather for its contribution of sherry casks that are used to age so many whiskies from other countries, especially Scotland. Still, as the whisky industry as a whole has boomed over the past decade or two, we're seeing an increasing number of distilleries popping up on the Iberian Peninsula as well.\r  \n\r  \nThis particular bottle is an interesting one; Navazos Palazzi has a relatively small production of whiskies, releasing only one batch a year at most, and often none, as they also spend time distributing gins, rums, and other spirits. This particular release came out in 2016 and consisted of only 900 total bottles at cask strength, all of which were aged in Palo Cortado sherry casks. This is a somewhat unusual sherry in general, and especially so in whisky aging; there might be some unusual flavors present here for us to explore.\r  \n\r  \nThe grains of used in creating this spirit are also not particularly common: while this is made mostly of corn, famous of course for its use in bourbon and other American whisky varieties, this corn was grown entirely in Spain (as were the rest of the grains involved in these bottles). Might we see a bit of terroir individuality involved here as well?\r  \n\r  \n**Navazos Palazzi Grain Whisky**\r  \n\r  \nSpain - Grain Whisky\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 105\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 53.5% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: 3 Palo Cortado sherry casks\r  \n**Details**: 900 bottle outturn; bottled in 2016; made from grain (mostly corn) grown in Spain\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 1 time; bottle at 60% fill level at time of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Decent amount of oak up front, and a big smack of wine; it's very rich overall. Smells a lot like a heavily fortified dessert wine, and there's a hint of a chemical taste as well, maybe acetone. Then the sweetness comes forward in the form of orange fruit rind, and a meaty wood scent finishes us off.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Fake chocolate syrup, and some oak in there, but it isn't too dry. Instead, it's rich and sweet, with a medium-thick mouthfeel, very syrupy, and slightly synthetic overall. Chocolate covered cherries, a bit of maltiness, and a touch of another chemical - gasoline?\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length finish, and now it's starting to mellow out from the strange flavors of the palate. There is still some of that synthetic chocolate, as well as red fruit and full-bodied red wine. Oak is very mild, but grows with time, resulting in a tiny bit of tannins at the end.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is quite unique, and the Palo Cortado cask has added a somewhat heavy red wine and red fruit influence here. Another couple of rather unique flavors with the fake chocolate and gasoline add to the strange mystique around this bottle, and while it does provide a flavor few others can match, it isn't the most complex bottle in the world either. Very interesting to try at least once or twice, but with an asking price of $105 in our area, we're not sure we'll splurge on a full bottle.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 6.5 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #23 - Paul John Brilliance Single Malt,8,ya3umv,https://i.redd.it/comb4z01y7v91.jpg,1666384150,,"[{'body': ""**Review #23 - Paul John Brilliance Single Malt**\r  \n\r  \n*NAS World Whisky Mini-Series: Part 1 of 4*\r  \n\r  \nOur next series focuses on whisky from other parts of the world, rather than our oft-sipped bourbons, ryes, and scotches. Additionally, this will be honing in on bottles without age statements, something easy to find in many countries outside of Scotland and the USA.\r  \n\r  \nWith our first entry in the series, we're looking at Paul John, specifically their single malt whisky named 'Brilliance.' Released starting in 2013, this is India-grown 6-row barley, distilled and then aged in Goa, supposedly for 3 to 5 years in ex-bourbon barrels. The conditions are going to have an effect on the grains and the maturation, so we'll be on the lookout for some less common flavor notes, though we could find commonalities with whisky from other hot climates like Taiwan or Texas.\r  \n\r  \n**Paul John Brilliance Single Malt**\r  \n\r  \nIndia - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 82\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 82\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \nNon chill filtered; Batch No. 1\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 11 months; bottles at 100%, 80%, and 70% (blind tasting) fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Light and pleasant, starting off with quite a bit of fruit: mild green apple, orange, apricot, and synthetic peach flavoring, and at one point, bananas foster with rum sauce. There are a couple of dark fruits like fig or extra dry raisin in there, too. One of the biggest flavor families overall, though, has to be the earthy, musty notes: wet dirt, rotting wood, moss, wood shavings and lumber... it's all a bit funky. As the bottle opened up, there were more wood and grain notes, things like cinnamon baking spice and some malt, barley sugars, maple syrup and brown sugar. There's definitely some young spirit in here, and later, it can turn slightly sour.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: This actually reflects the nose relatively well: plenty of fruit with orange, grapefruit, rich pear, hints of lemon, and a hint of that raisin. Ripe apples are there, too, but less green now, and it's coming across a bit hot. Then, the spirit and wood notes take over once more - cinnamon spice, drying oak, wood sugars, and a decent amount of vanilla. Tiny bit of smoke poking through, and along with it come grain, barley sugars, some sugar cream, and plenty of wood spice and hot peppers. Again, there is a young spirit note here, a little bit of ethanol comes through, and it's still a bit warm. Overall, mouthfeel is medium-thin.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length finish, but sometimes seemed shorter and sometimes longer. Some drying oak notes, but the fruit is still there: cinnamon apples, dark fruits, maybe a bit of ex-sherry maturation. It's a bit oily, and after the fruit, there is more spice development, baking spice and some pepper and lots of vanilla. A bit of smoke, too, but again, we eventually get back to those grainy spirit notes and oak kick.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Huh, this one was quite hard to place. The spread of the individual ratings from our different tastings of this whisky was the widest we've observed so far; sometimes it was quite mediocre, while other times, it seemed great. It's undeniable that this has a number of different tasting notes to offer, but the more the bottle opens up, the younger this seems, and the more hastily aged it feels - not a huge surprise given India's hot climate, which could lead to heavy wood interaction. This one is decent, but in truth, we might lean toward Paul John's 'Edited' release a bit more often. One last note: the label, 'Brilliance?' Here's one whisky with name that isn't a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Story is the same with the barrels and age, so we're again expecting some congruence with the main flavors.

Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Starts off quite medicinal and inky, and there's some rubber in there as well. Lots of vegetative peat, quite rich overall, and the smoke this time has some ash in it. We're finding mildly damp wood as well as dry driftwood, plenty of salinity or brine, and now quite a lot of barbecue notes - it's a bit saucy. Savory campfire cooking, a hint of oily sausage, somewhat on the dry side, but there a bit of sweetness arrives in the form of red or meaty orange fruit; once, even a touch of stone fruit. As this develops, the barbecue notes become sweeter, and the ashy peat feels thinner.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Mouthfeel is medium-thick, and its packing tons of flavor. Lots of peat as usual, also a bit of heat, and plenty oily; tons of salinity and brine, just a hint of funk in that peat smoke. Just slightly earthy, lots of black ash, or the remains of a day-old campfire, with a hint of dampness. Fruit comes via lemon citrus and oranges, but those burning driftwood and rubber notes begin to overpower the more subtle flavors, and the medicinal character is never far away. Later, there are hints of balsamic and rosemary, and once, a bit of burning propane.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: This finish goes on for a long time, full of saucy barbecue on the grill, waves of peat, and more of that ashy smoke. Seriously, peat forever. It's oily, and there are some dry oak notes that prickle the tongue and cheeks. A little bit earthy, some wood smoke added in as well, and a hint of char and vanilla later on. This is still going several minutes after the last sip.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: What a way to wrap these up - for us, this is the best of the bunch. We love the addition of the more savory notes, especially in the nose and finish, and it still retains plenty of the Laphroaig character that we're looking for. Finish goes on for ages, one of the longest we can remember. $100 isn't cheap for a bottle, but to us, this punches well above its weight - hard to compare it to many other 10 year bottles, or cask strength bottles.

This bottling came roughly a year after the first, in early 2020, but employs that same Laphroaig spirit character along with the same aging regime.\r  \n\r  \nBatch 11 had all of the distillery character we've come to expect, but was heavier into the wood smoke and some ex-bourbon characteristics of vanilla and oak, with a touch of sweetness.

Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Jumps out of the glass, strong peat and oils. Like sitting in a Scottish bog next to a campfire - there are slightly vegetal notes, damp moss and wood, quite smoky, even a bit of sweet barbecue. It's a bit salty, too, slightly medicinal (the classic 'Band-Aid' note), mildly sweet notes from lemon, and a little bit of straw or grass. As this opens up later, there is a hint of rotting wood, and the barbecue note grows stronger.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: So much peat, it can be overwhelming; hot oil, a thick mouthfeel, iodine and lots of medicinal herbs. A very intense experience overall, but once you get past the tingling around the cheeks and tongue, a few more flavor notes creep out: a bit of acidity, some seaweed, more wood astringency than the nose, but still somewhat mild there. The citrus has changed to orange now, and along with spice like pepper and salt, there is ashy smoke and coal, also a bit of barbecue later.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is long, a little bit hot but actually not too bad considering the strength. Some of that wood astringency grows stronger and lingers, peat is there all the time before finally waning, leaving room for yellow and orange citrus, oils and acidity, and more of those coastal notes: salt or sea water and seaweed. This is all finished off with black pepper and maybe the tiniest bit of red fruit.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Another great entry - if you're a peathead, it's hard to deny the greatness of the experience that comes with a heavily peated cask strength malt, and this bottle is checking all of the boxes. This specific batch came with some heavier seaside and green boggy notes, as opposed to the classic ex-bourbon of Batch 11; both are very good, and a preference between the two may come down to personal tastes. That said, all of these differences are still somewhat subtle - the basic character of the spirit is still coming through as the dominant influence at all times.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 8.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

How much variation are we going to see batch to batch? Some better and some worse, or solid consistency throughout?\r  \n\r  \nLaphroaig began releasing numbered batches of their 10 CS back in 2009, and now we're 13 years and 15 batches in, with a 16th on its way soon. Not an allocated product but also not always easy to find, this is a whisky that many collectors will like seek out so they can compare the different releases over the years. From what we've heard, there is slightly variation, but the quality floor is pretty high.\r  \n\r  \n**Laphroaig 10 Year Cask Strength Batch 11**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Islay - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 100\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 58.6% ABV\r  \nBatch 11, bottled in March 2019\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 1 month; bottles at 90% and 80% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Big Laphroaig peat smoke, a blast of iodine, and the character of this one is slightly more meaty - subtle, but it's there. Burning wood, heavy on the wood smoke, and an old campfire with that grey, long-dried wood. Just hints of minerality and earth, some ash, the smoke even feels a bit brittle at times. Then, sweet lemon juice opens from the top of the glass, along with some oaky vanilla. The note that lingers most is the medicinal characteristic.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Powerful, lots of smoke, both ashy and slightly earthy - that ash is stronger than it was on the nose. Day old campfire, iodine and sea salt, and more oak tannins this time; the citrus comes back, but in addition to mildly tart lemon, we're now finding some sweet orange. It can even come across as orange soda, or a sherbet note, maybe lemon-orange candies. There is a bit of a spirit kick trailing behind the ABV, and then it's back to the wood notes: black wood char, a hint of that synthetic machine-made theatre smoke, some wood sugars, and a bit of vanilla icing. The mouthfeel here is medium-thick.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Long finish, and while the peat lingers and is plenty strong and full of ash and medicinal iodine, there are more delicate flavors of vanilla bean ice cream, orange fruit, and something just slightly savory hiding behind. Medium-dry wood notes, and a decent amount of oak on this finish, really.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This just screams 'Laphroaig,' but in a good way - everything we love about the normal 10 year bottling, but turned up to 11. It has all of the distillery character we want, and because of the reduced dilution, you get a few extra hidden flavors that start to creep out at times.

Review #19 - Barrell Armida,25,xy239u,https://i.redd.it/ggiwyo2sjes91.jpg,1665156549,,"[{'body': ""**Review #19 - Barrell Armida**\r  \n\r  \n*Rum Cask Finish Mini-Series: Part 3 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nOur last stop in this series, this time a bourbon: Barrell Armida. This one adds a twist to the rum cask finishing as well: here, we also get the influence of Sicilian amaro and pear brandy casks. As per usual with Barrell, this is a blend of sourced whiskies, this specific blend created as 'an experiment, trying to make a dream whiskey come to fruition' according to the brand's website.\r  \n\r  \nWhat else can we compare this to? Rum casks aren't particularly uncommon in whisky aging these days, and we can find a few examples of whiskies with brandy (sometimes specifically Cognac) aging, but the Sicilian amaro is a real wildcard. Maybe some sweet notes, maybe some spice, maybe a bit effervescent and exotic? Let's find out.\r  \n\r  \n**Barrell Armida**\r  \n\r  \nUSA - Bourbon\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 93\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 90\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 56.41% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: New charred oak, rum, Sicilian amaro, and pear brandy casks\r  \n**Other information**: Bottle #6186, distilled in Indiana and Tennessee\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 9 months; bottles at 100%, 60% (blind tasting), and 50% (blind tasting) fill level at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Despite the wild casks, we're starting with some more traditional bourbon notes: it's mellow, decently oaky, quite rich, and has some sweetness from cherry, caramel, and brown sugar; there's a touch of ethanol heat as well, not surprising given the strength. There are plenty of layers of complexity to dig into, though, starting with a lot of dark fruit, plums for sure, as well as some sharp orange. The exotic notes are there, too: a bit of coconut, some pineapple, apple, rich cane sugar, even jalapeno. It's rounded out by vanilla and a hint of chocolate, but at the end of nosing, it feels more like we've been smelling a cocktail, maybe a Boulevardier.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Lots of spice on the first few sips, it's hot, punchy, there is smoked paprika and red pepper flakes. Thick mouthfeel, quite oily. All of that is aided by some heavier oak tannins, though in our various tastings, the oak sometimes showed up heavier than other times. The syrupy sweetness is there, too, flavors like caramel, brown sugar, cherry cough medicine, molasses, and red fruits. Jeez, this just keeps going and going: there are more spices like pepper, cinnamon, and even cayenne, but also some butter and licorice. Sometimes a bit tropical, and later on, a huge Campari aperitif note - these must have been some wet casks before the bourbon was added.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Long finish, the oils and heat are sticking around for a while. Still rich, full of dry wood notes and barrel spice, warm bread, baking spices and cayenne. In terms of fruit, it's a bit lighter now, stone fruit like sharp peach or some pineapple. The last notes that linger are some of that anise/licorice, and a semi-bitter amaro flavor really sticks out.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Wow, this stuff is quite interesting. Good? Yes. Great? Well, the tasting notes are so exotic and all over the place, it's a bit difficult to call this coherent. This is a fun bourbon if you want to take time to explore the unusual notes, but as a casual sipper, it's definitely going to turn a few people off with its heat and one-off flavors.

Review #18 - Balvenie 14 Year Caribbean Cask,88,xwia13,https://i.redd.it/zrzes5nl51s91.jpg,1664994399,,"[{'body': ""**Review #18 - Balvenie 14 Year Caribbean Cask**\r  \n\r  \n*Rum Cask Finish Mini-Series: Part 2 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nPart 2 in our series of rum cask whiskies, and this time we're in Scotland with Balvenie. A Speyside giant, this is one of the better known brands in single malt Scotch, especially as people are first entering the hobby. Here, we'll look at their 14 year aged stated single malt, specifically a bottling that has some finishing in Caribbean rum casks.\r  \n\r  \nBalvenie is known for trying some experimental cask finishes, as well as a few other unusual projects for a classic Speyside distillery: each year, they spend one week distilling from peated malt, and part of their core range releases includes single barrel bottlings. This 14 year CC isn't quite that strange or unique, but it still provides an interesting niche to explore further.\r  \n\r  \n**Balvenie 14 Year Caribbean Cask**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Speyside - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 90\r  \n**Age Statement**: 14 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-bourbon, finished in Caribbean rum casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 13 months; bottles at 90%, 60%, and 50% fill level at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: On the sweeter side overall, some brown sugar, cereal notes, a bit creamy. Vanilla flowers, a bit of sweetened condensed milk, and soft oak is there but not very bitter. Really, it's somewhat soft in general, with caramel sugars, some white wine, and later, a touch of leather and hint of ethanol.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Palate starts of slightly more dry than expected, actually, still on the soft side; mouthfeel is medium-thin. The notes of vanilla and cream, caramelized sugar and mild oak linger from the nose, but then we're in new territory: touch of char, coconut, and instead of brown sugar, now it's more like simple syrup or maple syrup. There is also a bit more fruit on this palate: pineapple and underripe pear, as well as banana bread. All topped off with a bit of cinnamon baking spice.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Light and nicely sweet, sweeter as it goes on, but slightly short in length; the cinnamon spice from the end of the palate lingers, as well as some maltiness and a more distinct rum cask signature. Plenty of sugary creamy cereal notes, almost sickly sweet at times. Late in the palate, a hint of darker fruit like plum.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is nice and pleasant, not really going to offend anyone with its sweeter mellow notes. Decent stuff, but maybe a bit too soft? Would be a good casual sipper, but might not have the complexity that leads to more interesting exploration of flavors. On top of that, the price has been rising on this bottle, a bit too fast; while it has a decent age statement, the depth and intricacy that should come from the maturation period isn't quite there, which makes this a slightly tough sell.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 6.8 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #17 - Angel's Envy Finished Rye,58,xs3x8r,https://i.redd.it/mog774ati0r91.jpg,1664550879,,"[{'body': ""**Review #17 - Angel's Envy Finished Rye**\r  \n\r  \n*Rum Cask Finish Mini-Series: Part 1 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThis series is all about finishing - we'll look at a few categories of whisky, an example of each which has spent some time aging in rum casks. Our first entry comes in the form of a rye whisky, specifically a product from Angel's Envy. We were first intrigued by AE when we found their port-finished bourbon, and it seems the brand wasn't finished there with their unique whisky cask finishes.\r  \n\r  \nSimilar to the rum-finished bottle of peated Speyside scotch we looked at a couple of weeks ago, we're expecting to find some serious sweet notes on these upcoming bottles, along with potential exotic notes as well. According to the brand's website, this bottling can spend up to 18 months in the finishing rum casks, which is longer than many finishing casks are employed - those flavors might be quite heavy here.\r  \n\r  \n**Angel's Envy Finished Rye**\r  \n\r  \nUSA - Rye\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 85\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 50% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: New charred oak, finished in Caribbean rum casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 2 times over 9 months; bottles at 50% and 30% fill level at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: There's a sweet cereal note here, not oatmeal, but like a sugary boxed breakfast cereal from a US grocery. Hard to place exactly... no, this is EXACTLY like Golden Grahams. You know, that cheaper version of Cinnamon Toast Crunch? Yeah, it's just like that. Anyways, we're finding a lot of notes you might expect, then: strong sweet baking spices, brown sugar, bready cookies. There's maple syrup, icing sugar, and a touch of cream; maybe a bit of clove as well, and it's slightly exotic. Later, a bit grainy, and a touch of young rye - maybe herbal eucalyptus?\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Brown sugar and rum, lots of molasses sugars and just plenty of sweetness overall. There is a kick of spice on the palate as well, a bit of nutmeg, but mostly other baking spices. Decent oiliness and plenty of flavor, and the medium mouthfeel is complemented by some gentle warmth from mild or moderate oak influence. Lots of the same notes from the nose such as cereal or oatmeal, semi-sweet sugar cookies, and cinnamon, but there is a bit of a more exotic spice, followed by that hint of eucalyptus. Coconut, cream and sugar in an old coffee, and a bit of pepper finish it off, before a subtle hint of... cactus?\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Finish is medium length, bordering on long, with plenty of brown sugar, grainy spirit notes, and oily wood tannins. It's still mostly sweet flavors, with exotic fruit juice, cream, maple syrup and molasses, but there it a tiny bit more balance on this finish with those oak flavors added.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: We're not entirely sure we would call this refined, because it's anything but subtle, but it has a certain unique character that we're finding pretty interesting. One big trick here is the price - we can find it around USD 85 right now, but there have been some fluctuations in the last couple of years, and often we've seen it for sale closer to USD 100. At that level, we're expecting some pretty serious whisky, and while this one is fun to explore and has a decent ABV presentation at 50%, the value might not quite be there yet - this feels a little bit steep.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.5 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #16 - Springbank 12 Year Cask Strength,144,xqkqw0,https://i.redd.it/71eaxm7t9nq91.jpg,1664390594,,"[{'body': ""**Review #16 - Springbank 12 Year Cask Strength**\r  \n\r  \n*Cask Strength Favorites Mini-Series: Part 3 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThe final review in this mini-series, and we're rounding it all off with Springbank 12 Year CS, specifically Batch 21 which was bottled in 2020. We were lucky enough to stumble upon this when we weren't even looking for it, and honestly, we didn't know how special/sought after it was. If we could only go back a couple of years and buy everything on the shelf (just kidding, we're not hoarding over here, but we probably would have gotten a second bottle).\r  \n\r  \nIt's unfortunate that Springbank of any kind is now borderline impossible to find in many markets, and while we don't see it often, we're still 'lucky' enough to be able to buy a bottle or two from this distillery each year. They rarely disappoint, but the cask strength bottlings specifically get quite a bit of hype, and it's time to find out if it's for real. How does this stack up against our other cask strength favorites, Wild Turkey Rare Breed and Redbreast 12 CS?\r  \n\r  \n**Springbank 12 Year Cask Strength**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Campbeltown - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid (per 750ml)**: USD 105\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 330 (currently unavailable in stores near us, using online secondary pricing)\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 56.1% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Bourbon, Sherry, Port, and Burgundy casks (Batch 21)\r  \nNon chill filtered and no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 12 months; bottles at 100%, 80%, 70%, and 60% fill level at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Where to start? Very rich, unusual, oily and dense, and has that distinct Campbeltown funk of musk and dirty industrial machinery. Plenty of musty red wine influence, we have the sherry, the semi-dried dark fruits of raisin and overripe strawberry and plum and prune; there's a bit of dark chocolate too, later. This is really turning into a charcuterie board as it opens up: yeasty fresh bread, dried salami, almost a bit of savory cheese. Tiny olive note, some heather or dried hay, and sweet potato french fries. We're finding that both the peat and oak char influences are quite mild, but this is decently sweet overall, and there is now just a touch of leather and blackberry jam. Finishes with a bit of bitter orange fruit, and then a sugar that's almost sickly sweet.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Charcuterie board theme continues on the palate: funky red wine, warm, red fruit jams, mild barbecue char with sauce on a fire, bready pretzels. Fruits all over the place, we're getting orange citrus oil, stewed strawberry, sweet raspberry, sweet green apples, even blackberries. A little bit of that sherry sulfur note comes along, but it's balanced by vanilla, baking spice, some milk chocolate and a blast of port wine. Other than the charcuterie notes, it's classic Springbank: rich, industrial grunge and quite funky, earthy at times, and mild peat smoke like a fire in the hearth on a cold autumn day. Very oily, the mouthfeel is medium-thick, and there's a mossy cellar taste, damp hay and leather accentuating it. Finishes with some brown sugar butter and a bit of pepper spice.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long finish, the sherry and tingling oak tannins stick around the gums for a while. Quite oily still, musky, and sometimes a bit sulfuric (but we don't mind); plenty of fruit still to go around, with sharp plums, orange, a touch of exotic white stone fruit. There is a little bit of spice, maybe from the wood - red pepper flakes, or pepper? But then it's sweet once more, with fresh baked rolls, creme brulee, a touch of underripe strawberry. This is all underscored by the usual mild peat, the industrial musk.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Seriously, where can we find another bottle? This is fantastic. In all honestly, due to the way we average our ratings, this score is actually being held down slightly by the first rating, which was a neck pour that was a bit closed up. Once it did open up, wow, it's hard to even know where to start. A bit of a chameleon - it can change complexion depending on the day and the tasting setting, but no matter which flavors show up, they're exceedingly nice and complex and layered. Can't recommend this enough at MSRP, and while we're not going to pay the secondary online pricing to get another one of these, there is a little part of us that wants to.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 8.6 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #15 - Redbreast 12 Year Cask Strength,19,xm99fc,https://i.redd.it/y7qp7j41bop91.jpg,1663967174,,"[{'body': 'For a brief moment I read this title and almost lost my mind because I thought they had released a Redbreast 15 Cask Strength.', 'score': 4}, {'body': ""**Review #15 - Redbreast 12 Year Cask Strength**\r  \n\r  \n*Cask Strength Favorites Mini-Series: Part 2 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThe second entry in our cask strength lineup: Redbreast 12 CS out of Ireland. Perhaps our favorite Irish brand at the moment, though we admit we need to try a wider variety from this great whiskey-producing country - there are just so many to choose from!\r  \n\r  \nThe normal 12 year bottling is a mainstay on our shelf, always a great sipper with a couple of interesting flavors to offer. How will this one stack up? Like the ol' reliable 12 year, but turned up to 11? Or will there be some new tastes and complexity to go along with all of that strength?\r  \n\r  \n**Redbreast 12 Year Cask Strength**\r  \n\r  \nIreland - Single Pot Still\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 84\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 84\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 56.3% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 11 months; bottles at 100%, 90%, and 70% fill level at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Honey and mildly sweet apples, with a bit of red wine or sangria; it is a bit strong at first, but settles down as you get into the glass. There is some icing sugar, bread and baked goods to go along with the vanilla, brown sugar, and a bit of oak. Slightly sharp spirit, a little bit metallic at times, but still new flavors come forward: dark stewed fruits, a hint of salt, grass and leaves, and fresh lumber. With the nose situated a little further back from the glass, perfume and flowers are there as well.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Mouthfeel is thick, and this is quite rich and oily all around. Warmth from hot cinnamon oranges, orange rind, and a little bit of pepper spice; sweet apples and overripe pear, too, or even a mild stone fruit like peach. There is a little bit of smoke coming in with the wood notes, and the oakiness is medium. Brown sugar and baking spices take over, barley grain, cereal, even a hint of nutmeg and semi-sweet baked goods; bread and butter. All of this is rounded out with syrupy dark fruit, and then finishes with a hint of leather and perfume.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The warmth here lingers for a while, and the finish is of a medium-long length. It's pleasant, though, and we're finding apples, caramel, and some cinnamon red hots; then the subtle notes, orange rind, reddish-purple sherry fruit, vanilla, and oats. After the tannins subside, we're left with that little perfumed leather note from the palate, but it actually grows a bit stronger and comes to the front - this almost tastes a bit older and more developed than 12 years might make you think.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Great dram; this looks like it will be a mainstay on the shelf as well. More complexity and a greater variety of notes than your average 12 year old whisky has to offer, and while the ABV strength does shove some heat down the throat at first, this mellows out to be a rather nice warm experience, like spicy candies. We're lucky that we can still find this regularly in our market, and we'd recommend it to anyone looking for a different take on a cask strength spirit.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.8 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\r  \n\r  \n**Value Rating**: 7.08"", 'score': 3}, {'body': ""Spots, Blue noteable...

This isn't necessarily a group of the 'best' cask strength bottles we've ever had; more like the bottles that hold a special place in our hearts, bottles that we won't hesitate to grab off the shelf if we see them around MSRP.\r  \n\r  \nFirst up in the series: Wild Turkey's Rare Breed. Weighing in at a solid 117 proof, this is our go-to bourbon if we're looking for a punch. Not aged stated, but supposedly a mix of 6 year, 8 year, and 12 year bourbons, this shows some complexity behind the heat and changes from spicy to sweet depending on the day.\r  \n\r  \n**Wild Turkey Rare Breed Barrel Proof Bourbon**\r  \n\r  \nUSA - Bourbon\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 52\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 55\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 58.4% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 8 months; bottles at 100%, 70%, and 60% (blind tasting) fill level at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Warm but not unpleasantly so, and there is definitely oak up front here; it isn't bitter, but shows more than some other bourbons. Sugars from caramel and vanilla, maybe a bit of brown sugar, and then mild black pepper and other spice. Overall, pretty balanced, maybe leaning slightly dry, but the sweetness grows the longer this is left to open up. Smaller notes of mint or anise, and then a hint of red fruit, almost a red wine.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium-thick mouthfeel here on the palate, and the heat builds throughout the experience, but never becomes too much. A real mix of flavors depending on the day: wood sugars, caramel, molasses, and hints of red fruit contribute to sweetness, while we also find cinnamon, black pepper, paprika, and just a touch of anise later on. Rounded out by the wood notes, vanilla and some mild barrel char, and at the end, we get just a touch of candied or caramel apple.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish on this is medium-long, more oils hanging around than were present on the palate. It's warm of course, but nice, and this finish is more on the dry side as opposed to sweet. The oak is contributing plenty of flavor, but still not too bitter, maybe spiced would be a better description, like a pepper or a nutmeg. Plenty of vanillin, too, baking spice, and with the dying breaths, we're finding cardamom and prunes.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This will likely always be on our shelf - plenty of complexity to enjoy neat, and is also great for spicing up a nice cocktail, adding some flavor and strength. The balance of this is one of its best attributes, with a variety of sweet notes being balanced out masterfully by oak and spice; the age feels just about right, all things considered. With the reasonable prices in most markets, we would definitely recommend picking up a bottle, as well.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 6.7 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #13: Glenfiddich Fire & Cane,73,xfzrbg,https://i.redd.it/f6pswvxbp9o91.jpg,1663354604,,"[{'body': ""**Review #13 - Glenfiddich Fire & Cane**\r  \n\r  \n*Peated Speysider Mini-Series: Part 3 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nThe final part of this review series, from the Speyside giant Glenfiddich - by many people's estimation, the quintessential Scotch whisky distillery. This bottling is far from their ordinary malts, though; the fourth installment of the Experimental Series, following the IPA cask (01), Project XX (02), and Winter Storm (03); we're seeing an unusual peated Glenfiddich, with the addition of more exotic casks to amp up the flavors in the liquid. Will it still contain some of that classic Glenfiddich character, or is this something entirely unique?\r  \n\r  \nLike the BenRiach Smoky Ten we reviewed last week, this has some rum cask aging, so we're looking for tropical fruit and quite a bit of sweetness. Time to find out if this has more or less to offer than two of its main competitors in the specialty Speyside market.\r  \n\r  \n**Glenfiddich Fire & Cane**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Speyside - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 54\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 55\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 43% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-Bourbon casks and Ex-Rum Casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 12 months; bottles at 100%, 80% (blind tasting), and 70% fill level at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Peat starts off mild but quickly grows in intensity, and there is just a little bit of mustiness from earth or damp wood. Past that, it's lots of sweet fruit: orange citrus tang, mild lemon, cantaloupe, and sherbet. There is just a little bit of spice, not much oak to speak of, but there is creme brulee, a hint of coconut, and sweet cream coming from the bourbon and rum casks. Along with the cream, even a subtle hint of aged charcuterie cheese if you're looking for it.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Medium mouthfeel, maybe slightly thin, and some heat now. Peat is medium, not too strong, but brings a campfire to mind; then we get the fruit bomb once more, with tons of orange, lemons, cantaloupe, melon, and key lime pie. It isn't overly sweet despite all of the tropical fruit, more balanced, with some mild oak influence and gentle sugars from custard cream, rum caramels, vanilla, and sherbet, especially orange sherbet. The longer this opens up, the more it is like a peated orange creamsicle.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length finish, not too harsh in any way, but that's not to say it's lacking flavor. Rich peat smoke, if a little thin, but it's not ashy, more like slightly astringent. There is a wood note that feels somewhat young, and some acidic lemon to go with the tropical orange. End of the finish is creamy, with vanilla and a tiny bit of white pepper.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: A pretty interesting bottle, and we'd be lying if we said we didn't like that orange creamsicle note on the palate - in fact, we love that flavor. Not exactly a subtle malt, but the flavors are round and balanced enough that we're happy to pick this up more often for a taste. Is it head and shoulders about the other two whiskies in our mini-series, The Smoky Ten from BenRiach and Benromach's Peat Smoke? No, but by our estimation, this Glenfiddich slightly edges the others out, as reflected by the higher rating and value proposition.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.5 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

This tiny distillery has one of the smallest productions in Speyside, but they're clearly big on flavor and experimentation. Along with the Peat Smoke bottling, there are others like The Organic, vintages, peat + sherry releases, and a number of single casks.\r  \n\r  \nOur bottle was released before Benromach completed its latest rebrand, so we know this is a few years old. Another interesting review might be a comparison between this release and the current year releases, but that will come another time. Right now, we want to know this - what curiosities does this malt have to offer in the increasing market of peated Speysiders?\r  \n\r  \n**Benromach Peat Smoke**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Speyside - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 75\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 70\r  \n**Age Statement**: 9 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 7 months; bottles at 100%, 30%, and 20% fill level at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: The peat in here is quite earthy and vegetal, damp, like damp leaves in the autumn after a rain. It's slightly ashy, too, and there is a bit of funk to go along with decomposing plants, even mud, and some sweet lemon mold. Past the peat smoke, the spirit is medium, bordering on light in complexion, even a bit delicate with baked goods, some citrus from orange and lime, and a distinct green banana note. At one point, we got butterscotch and stone fruit, while another, there was a little bit of a chemical note - not acetone, but like a mildly scented cleaning solution.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Butter, butterscotch, and a medium viscosity. The peat is medium level here, and though there is a slightly lighter complexion to the spirit, there is still that damp, earthy, green funk. Flavors all over the place now: stone fruit and banana, vanilla sweetness and icing sugar, a bit of barbecue and a hint of campfire, even a dark fruit sweetness from raisin. The oak is somewhat mild and honeyed, and we finish the palate with notes of baked bread rolls, minerality, and even a hint of machine oil.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Peat stays on the tongue the longest here, but it's never too harsh, and there is a bit of a sweet and tart tickle that sneaks in later. It's a medium length finish, possibly pushing long; the spirit characteristics are poking through that smoke, and there are fruits once more, fruits like sweet honeyed apples, banana, orange, and prune extract; baking spices are here as well, just mild though, like vanilla. Oak is very oily, soft and round, and maybe earthy.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is definitely an unusual dram, and while there are some tasting notes in common with the previously reviewed BenRiach Smoky Ten, this bottle has a very different and distinct earthy, vegetal, green character that's hard to miss. A curiosity? Definitely. Something we would reach for often? Eh, maybe not as much.

Review #11: BenRiach The Smoky Ten,18,xa1vwc,https://i.redd.it/hfptrrhpevm91.jpg,1662745786,,"[{'body': ""**Review # 11 - BenRiach The Smoky Ten**\r  \n\r  \n*Peated Speysider Mini-Series: Part 1 of 3*\r  \n\r  \nWe're starting a quick review series here - Speyside single malts with peated malt used in the distillation process. While Speyside is known for its nice, pleasant, sometimes simple single malts, most of which are aged in bourbon or sherry casks, the demand for more whisky in recent years has led to a proliferation of brands and styles of single malts. Many distilleries are experimenting with ideas that are not necessarily traditional for their regions, or even their country; we're seeing this across Scotland, in the USA with the American single malt, in Oceania with exotic wood cask finishes, and in many other countries that are developing whisky traditions from scratch.\r  \n\r  \nThis particular peated speysider has an additional layer of uniqueness: it is triple cask matured, with ex-bourbon, ex-rum, and virgin oak casks used. Perhaps this isn't a surprise, as this distillery was revived by Billy Walker, whose brands are no strangers to exotic cask finishes and interesting combinations (GlenAllachie, anyone?). We're expecting some pretty serious sweet notes from this bottle, and maybe some extra layers of complexity with tropical fruit. Will that be the case?\r  \n\r  \n**BenRiach The Smoky Ten**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Speyside - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 47\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 47\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Bourbon casks, Jamaican Rum casks, and Virgin Oak Casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 2 months; bottles at 100%, 90%, and 80% fill level at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: We're getting medium peat up front here, and it's cleaner in character, not too earthy or vegetal. Interestingly, there is a definite salt note here, and just a little bit of youthful vigor. Then we get into the flavor notes: vanilla sweetness, a touch of buttery oak, heather, and damp hay. There is some fruit hiding inside as well, in the form of lemon or citrus, even a lemon-lime soda. Butterscotch, cream, and a sweet bread round it out. All of that said, this isn't the strongest nose in the world - you have to search around a little bit.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Peat is still a medium strength on the palate, but it's covered by loads of vanilla, sweet cream, just lots of sweetness in general; some toasted coconut and butter as well. There is a distinct wood smoke note from the virgin oak, but this whisky generally sticks to the classic Speyside ex-bourbon character with the addition of peat; light in complexion, somewhat clean, and medium-thin mouthfeel. Later, we do get wood sugars and some baking spice, such as cinnamon and nutmeg. This is all topped with honeyed peaches, heather, and hay.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: A medium length finish here, and while the peat has faded from the level of the palate, it does linger gently for some time. A lot of the same notes as the palate: straw, very mild oak, some cream, and vanilla with honey pancakes. Oak is very gentle, not dry; there's butterscotch candies, and we fade to black with white chocolate chips.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: These flavors were in line with expectations, and it's a good whisky, if slightly restrained and docile. Always pleasant, and that peat does add a layer of complexity not often seen with neighboring distilleries, but we aren't finding a big hook to bring us back to this bottle again and again.

The oak contributes wood sugars, plenty of spice like nutmeg, mild anise, and even a little bit of cookie or biscuit. Not much in the way of fruit notes, we\'re mostly contained to baking spices and sugars here. There are also several young spirit notes: corn, a bit of other grains, and a decent ethanol kick. Later, we do get just a smattering of leather and molasses.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Thick mouthfeel here, oily and in your face and hot. Sweetness from vanilla and maple syrup at first, but we quickly move into dry spice like mild black pepper, a hint of rye, oak spice, and cinnamon; there is white pepper and a touch of paprika as well. The longer this opens up, there is slightly more variety in the flavors, with a savory meat, brown sugar, wood oils, and a hint of mild cherry showing up in different tastings.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium-long finish, it lingers with wood oils, some sweetness and slowly increasing wood tannins, but they never get too harsh. The heat from the palate is still there, it\'s quite hot, and the oak feels a bit dry and young; in terms of flavors, we\'re finding maple, light brown sugar and baking spice, and just a hint of mild green apple.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This packs a punch, but, despite the tasting notes listed, this feels like it starts to fall down a little bit on complexity (not entirely surprising considering the age); still, for a cask strength single barrel pick, this seems like decent value.

Not exactly your typical Islay malt, but this one has earned the respect of many, much like its distillery in general.\r  \n\r  \n**Bunnahabhain 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Islay - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 66\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 65\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46.3% ABV\r  \nNon chill filtered no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 10 months; bottles at 60%, 100%, and 70% fill level at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Great juicy dark fruits, really these fruits are just jumping out of the glass: raisin, prune juice, a hint of grapes. Some mild to slightly dark chocolate there as well, and some nutmeg and clove, with just a hint of salt; just slight oak, and vanilla and caramel are quite light. The fruits really are the star of the show here, though; there are also sultanas, a touch of orange, acidic prune, and some freeze dried strawberries. Later, just a minute perfume note as well.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Slightly warm on the palate, and the sherry influence from the casks definitely presents itself up front: slightly more bitter fruit, but still in that general vein of red, orange, and purple dried fruits. It's plum, Luxardo cherry, oily raisin, prune. There is still that bit of orange, which is followed by some wood sugars and a stronger oak note, a bit of tannin and astringency; the mouthfeel is medium, and a we end with some light nuttiness.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish is generally medium length, lots of cozy warmth from the sherry, with those prunes, raisins, and dark cherry; those fruits are slightly acidic and dried, and there's even a hint of stone fruit from peach or nectarine at times. It's oily, and there is some lingering oak there, slightly drying, and ends with just a bit of wood char. After one of the tastings, about an hour after finishing the glass, a hint of sweet sherry fruit was still coming back to the palate.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: The more we come back to this, the more our ratings are trending upward; in another few months, the average ratings on this might be a point higher. It's fantastically rich and fruity, and the tiny peat influence there always adds an interesting dynamic. Natural presentation and good strength are just the cherry on top here.

Review #8: Kaiyo The Peated,9,x2ia3b,https://i.redd.it/vowbmex1v2l91.jpg,1661964117,,"[{'body': ""What is everyone's favorite world whisky they've tried recently?"", 'score': 3}, {'body': ""**Review # 8 - Kaiyo The Peated**\r  \n\r  \nA foray into Japanese whisky, and another gift from family! This bottle has been in our collection for a little over a year now, and still finds ways to surprise us. From the relatively new brand of Kaiyo, this line spends some time in Madeira and Mizunara casks, is aged at sea, and ends up bottled at a respectable 46% ABV.\r  \n\r  \nThis definitely presents sometimes as a Scotch, which makes some sense, considering the shared 'heritage' between the two countries' whisky making scenes. It may also be due to the fact that the origin of the ingredients is unknown, and one rumor is that the peated barley is sourced from Scotland. Interestingly, this isn't even technically labeled as Japanese whisky, likely due to the fact that is does not spend all of its time aging in Japan.\r  \n\r  \n**Kaiyo The Peated**\r  \n\r  \nJapan - Blended Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 93\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 93\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 46% ABV\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Madeira Casks and Mizunara Oak\r  \nNon-chill filtered\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 4 months; bottles at 100%, 70% (blind tasting), and 80% fill level at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: The first note to jump out of the glass is salt, this is a blast of sea spray; it's followed by the peat, which is a medium amount, not too heavy. There is a definite wine influence here, but it's reserved; still this is rich and heavy overall, and comes forward with a variety of fruits next: hint of citrus sharpness, probably orange, and some mossy green apple and ripe pear. With a more open nose, there is more meatiness and a hint of sauce, just a bit of funk, and we end with a hint of that medicinal coastal influence.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: This palate is cozy and strong, drinks a little bit hotter than the 46% ABV would suggest, and it's a medium thickness mouthfeel. Salty and savory, like barbecue campfire and sauce, and that peat is again at a medium level, ever-present. In terms of fruit, there are little hints of lightness such as lemon and apple, but the dominant notes are those of ex-wine, with plenty of raisin and fig, maybe some prune juice, even a savory orange. The palate ends with bits of baking spice, both sweet and hot cinnamon.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Medium length finish, some mild peat hanging around; there is some oakiness in this finish, maybe bordering on tannic, but not really astringent. Not too hot now, pleasant, and there is some warm wine and sweet cinnamon, ending then with ripe, juicy orange and biscuits.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Good stuff, and seems to be changing in the bottle as it is open longer; a few different notes presenting themselves, and a lot in common with lighter Islay single malts. The presentation here is good, too, but like many Japanese whiskies during the last few years, this suffers from a steeper price, one that is only going up. Yes, it is aged with unusual barrels and in unusual ways (the sea voyage), but it would be great to see a release like this at a more affordable price. All of that said, for those willing to spend more on a unique bottle, we would be happy to recommend this one.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.4 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

I do wonder if part of the attraction of doing so is sending it south to where a warmer climate may speed up maturation - if say they went down to the Philippines or Taiwan, they might get some of the  rapid aging effects that for example Kavalan is known for, which would help with bringing a young whisky to market faster.

Typically known for producing pleasant, easy sipping spirits, some with bourbon maturation and others heavily sherried, this area has diversified in recent years to produce many different flavors and styles; most of the world's best-selling single malts still come from this region.\r  \n\r  \n**Glenrothes 12 Year**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Speyside - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 60\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 55\r  \n**Age Statement**: 12 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 40% ABV\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 9 months; bottles at 100%, 70%, and 60% fill level at times of review.

A cleaner spirit overall, mellow, the oak is very faint, and comes across just as a bit of wood sugar. Sweetness from orange and cinnamon, mild biscuits, and maybe a hint of caramel; as the dram opens up, that caramel turns to creme brulee. Tiny bit of a sour note, and once in a while, there is a darker fruit, almost like a sherry influence, but quite mild. Ends with green apple candy.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Quite mellow again on the palate, starts soft but definitely more dry than the nose was, the sweetness is muted at first. It's a medium-thin mouthfeel, and as the palate develops, a sour, almost bitter note comes through and takes center stage; not wood tannins, but more of a sour fruit, not particularly nice, in all honesty. There are some baking spices, such as imitation vanilla and brown sugar, and some cinnamon pokes through with a stronger oak note. Just a hint of sherry, but has lost a lot of its fruit character at this point.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: Short finish, not too oily either, and that sour and dry note is lingering from the palate into the finish. Very mild oak, and the strongest flavors are light brown sugar, maybe a baked good, and some cheap maple syrup.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: At first, we wrote that some of the closed nature and bitter notes might be due to a freshly opened bottle that needed some time and air; still, after tasting several more times, and several months of oxidation, we aren't connecting with this as we had hoped. Overall, it's a bit simple and muted, and the sour note on the palate and finish isn't our favorite quality; it's not a bad whisky, it's just alright.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 5.8 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass or brandy snifter each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: This varied of course between barrels/bottles, but there were some common themes: brown sugar, especially light brown sugar (although not too sweet overall), was always there, along with vanilla bean, mild to medium oak influence, and a little bit of cooking spice. When the spice shows up, it's often in the form of cardamom and nutmeg, and more occasionally clove and cinnamon.\r  \n\r  \nOne bottle had much more spice and varied fruit: there were red pepper flakes, black pepper, and some prune and sweet fig; we liked this one a lot. Another bottle was more muted and took a long time to open up in the glass; it had hints of caramel, cookies and baking spice, even candied pecans. Yet another bottle had fresh leather, and quite a strong cherry note as the nose mixed longer with the ambient air; like a dark Bing cherry, with a hint of grain.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Very well balanced across the range of bottles, with sweet notes from the nose carrying over, and some wood tannins that grow with time, just slightly astringent in the end. It's a medium-thick mouthfeel, nice and oily with that cask strength ABV, and we get sweetness in the form of brown sugar, vanilla, and toasted wood sugars. The spice is peppery, and there is a little anise tickle near the end.\r  \n\r  \nWhile one bottle was heavier on the spicy (nutmeg) and nutty side, another had a deep syrupy texture and boozy Luxardo cherries; yet another had some paprika, lots of dark purple fruits, and a bit of caramel sweetness.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: All of the bottles had a medium length finish, and there is a bit of warmth to this, the heat builds up across the palate and into the finish in the throat. The finish is definitely the oakiest part of the experience, both dry and with a bit of that wood sugar from the palate; this is probably the least complex part of the overall experience as well, with the sweetness coming from brown sugar and vanilla across the board, sometimes with added barrel char, molasses, or a tiny bitter fruit note, like unripe cherry.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: For us, this is a 'go-to' bourbon, essentially always in our collection, and a favorite casual sipper, both for us together, and with family and friends. A crowd pleaser as well, this generally gets very positive comments when others try it with us; as one of the more reasonably priced single barrel bourbons, and bottled at barrel strength, we foresee this bottle continuing to inhabit our shelfs for a long time to come.\r  \n\r  \nThere is some definite variation between the barrels, and while some of our individual reviews were around a rating of 6 to 6.5, others were up at 7.5; generally, we're choosing to sip this neat, or to put it in a whisky-forward cocktail such as an old fashioned.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 6.8 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whisky\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Count us in - we love to explore the unique character that individual cask releases present to us. While this release is from a huge distillery, with a well-practiced process than likely leads to plenty of consistency in the product, there are still some inevitable intricacies to dissect.\r  \n\r  \nGenerally aged 7 to 9 years and distilled from a high-rye recipe, this bourbon offers a nice mouthfeel, plenty of flavor, and nice balance between sweetness and oak.\r  \n\r  \n**Four Roses Single Barrel**\r  \n\r  \nUSA - Bourbon\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 42\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 43\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 50%\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 4 times over 8 months; bottles at 60% (Warehouse AN, Barrel No. 28-2B), 40% (Warehouse AN, Barrel No. 28-2B), 30% (Warehouse AN, Barrel No. 28-2B, tasted semi-blind), and 50% (local bar barrel pick, did not get cask information) fill level at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: There is some sweetness up front here, it's coming in the form of dark red fruit, like dark cherries, maybe a bit of light raisin, and some vanilla and brown sugar, even a hint of raspberry. This is balanced by a decent amount of oak, very light sharpness, and some wood smoke. There are spices, too, pepper and a sweeter spice like cardamom; ends with a touch of anise.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A bit less sweet than the nose suggested, there are more dry pepper and oak notes, along with a touch of ethanol. That oak really comes on stronger as the palate develops, and it's accompanied by some mild maraschino cherry, maybe even a hint of dark Luxardo cherry, and brown sugar. On a second taste, the oak bitterness build a bit more, and there are more spices, nutmeg and clove with just a dusting of anise. The mouthfeel is a medium thickness.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish lasts a medium amount of time, with mild warmth and a bit of syrupy sweetness. The oak now takes a more mild role, not too biting, but there is some wood sugar and light wood spice. Hints of candied orange rind, a little bit of red fruit, and baking spice; while it isn't lacking flavor, there is a certain softness on the palate, velvety might be a good description.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Nice stuff, this has a lot of your classic bourbon notes, but the two bottles we reviewed really honed in on a red fruit or cherry note, which is something we enjoy.

While not all of this distillery's recent endeavors (both in the bottle and outside it) have received as much love from the whisky community, the core range of releases are still giving us plenty to talk about.\r  \n\r  \n**Ardbeg 10 Year**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Islay - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 55\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 51\r  \n**Age Statement**: 10 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 46%\r  \nUn-chill filtered and no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 10 months; bottles at 90%, 40%, and 10% fill level at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: There's peat up front of course, but a lighter background follows it. Some seaside brine in the peat, very lightly medicinal, but also a bit of barbecue; the oak comes forward more on a second smell, a touch of sawdust, and there is a little bit of ash in it. The spirit behind all of this has character of lemons, even sweet lemon mold, and a bit of green fruit and plant. Hints of sharper icing sugar, maybe a bit of heat/spice/oil, and a little hint of malt if looking for it; it finishes with a bit of seaweed and balsamic.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: A decent amount of oil or butter, medium peat with a lush greenish complexion, and it builds to a heavy peat level. A decent level of salinity now, and along with a medium thickness mouthfeel, the smokiness takes on the form of a mild campfire, even a bit of barbecue with sweet fruits. Sharper lemon comes in as well, with a touch of spice like pepper and cayenne; rounds off with sweeter notes of vanilla and wood sugars.\r  \n\r  \n*\\[On a subsequent tasting, not one used for an 'official' review, there was a distinct bell pepper taste; not green, but a yellow or orange pepper. After adding water, this gave way to a buttery note, but the bell pepper returned another 15 minutes later.\\]*\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: This is a medium length finish, both savory and sweet, and even a touch of sour later on; decent depth. Not too hot, somewhat nice, and while the peat lingers, there is plenty of lemon zest, tropical citrus, a sweet barbecue sauce, and some wood tannins that gently tickle the palate. Finishes with mild butterscotch and wood smoke.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This is a whisky that will likely always have a space on our shelf, not only because it's one of our favorites and a great gateway to introduce new whisky drinkers to a peat blast, but also because of the fantastic value compared to many modern day malts.

This bottle gets many good reviews, and is the gateway for many people into unpeated Islay whisky.\r  \n\r  \nOne of our favorite distilleries currently, Bruichladdich has a wide array of releases each year, many of them special editions and very rare, and many going for quite a lot of money (more on that later).  And yet, these Hebridean Distillers are still probably best known for their core releases, The Classic Laddie and the Port Charlotte 10 Year, which they present at 50% ABV, with no chill filtration or added coloring, which is always refreshing.\r  \n\r  \n**Bruichladdich The Classic Laddie**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Islay - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 57\r  \n**Age Statement**: NAS\r  \n**Strength**: 50%\r  \n**Bottle Code**: L164189  20/182\r  \nUn-chill filtered and no color added\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 5 months; bottles at 80%, 70%, and 50% fill level at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Quite rich and hopping out of the glass, this shows some signs of bourbon aging, with sweeter sugars and caramels, a decent amount of vanilla or vanilla extract, and some rounded wood notes. Tiny bit of a meaty or savory note and even a hint of leather, and a touch of wood smoke or char later on, maybe even sawdust. When the fruits arrive, they\'re in the form of orange, sometimes a bit of dark dried fruits like fig and prune, or even a blackberry.  Rounding it all off is some baking spice, light nutmeg, and a little bit of a young barley spirit note.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: With a medium thickness mouthfeel, along with a noticeable warmth and coziness, this starts with a lighter complexion, sweet lemon and orange citrus, and some white grape and quite a lot of vanilla. Quite a solid spirit, if a bit shiny, but good character of barrel char and a hint of savory notes again, such as dried meat or dry rub barbecue. Butterscotch comes in, aided by those baking spices once more, nutmeg and just a sprinkling of pepper. The bottle in the third tasting must have come from a batch with a good proportion of first fill bourbon casks; decent oak influence, even a touch of anise.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: The finish here is medium length, and those oak notes on the palate, along with some orange fruit and vanilla, come through and linger. That oak is rich, not a lot of a tannin but just rich, and it comes along with bread rolls, some barley sugar, wood sugars, and even a hint of a tart strawberry or raspberry with the dying breath.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Always a solid malt, this is a great way to get started with unpeated Islay whiskies. Sure, it can be tempting to chase Bruichladdich\'s interesting releases like Octomore and Black Art, which on their day can be incredible, but do also vary by batch (and cost an arm and a leg); sometimes, though, with a hard-earned paycheck on the line, we want to go with strong, well-presented core releases like The Classic Laddie, always a good bet for a good price.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.0 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn\'t even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we know we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whiskey\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don\'t buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn\'t use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we\'ve tasted\r  \n10 - Can\'t imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we\'ve added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #2: Oban 14,83,wl4b9e,https://i.redd.it/53zjfqb1fxg91.jpg,1660154804,,"[{'body': ""**Review # 2 - Oban 14 Year**\r  \n\r  \nA gift from family, this is one of the oldest bottles in our collection; it's just about time for a bottle kill, as this has been sitting at a low fill level for a number of months, but there's something that stops of from dealing the final blow.\r  \n\r  \nIs it that we've moved on to other styles? Maybe there is a something sentimental about this bottle as a gift? In all likelihood, the reasoning rests in the fact that as a whisky collection grows, each lonely bottle gets visited less and less often, even if it's still as tasty as it was the day we first opened it.\r  \n\r  \n**Oban 14 Year**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Highland - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 80\r  \n**Age Statement**: 14 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43%\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 11 months; bottles at 50%, 30%, and 20% fill level at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes; third review was blind\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Somewhat soft and tame at first, but quite pleasant; a real coastal fruit bomb. Sometimes presents as red fruits like under-ripe strawberry and red apple, other times it can be a little sharper with lemon and some orange, or a white grape. A little bit of red wine as well, and later, the darker fruits creep in, plum and a little bit of raisin. Rounding it all off is that great coastal spray, and a little bit of floral perfume.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: Getting white grape again on the palate here, the overall mouthfeel is slightly thin, but the rich flavor makes up for some of that.  Soft sweetness from fruits once more, lots of plum and orange, and a bit of nectarine; just a hint of apple and pear, and maybe lemon citrus again. Bits of baking spice and brown sugar, almost a marshmallow sweetness at times.  Later in the tasting, just a bit of an oak tannin tickle creeps in.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: This finish is of medium length, nice warmth around the palate, but still delicate and somewhat light. Those oak tannins appearing in the palate linger, but they're soft, not astringent or tingling. Balanced overall, though we do get a little bit of a sweeter ending, with green apples, a touch of candy, and then the tiniest whiff of wood smoke.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: Classic and pleasant, this is always an enjoyable dram, even if we aren't reaching for it at every opportunity.  Will we replace this with another bottle once it's finally gone? Perhaps not immediately, though we're sure it will find its way back into the collection sometime in the future.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 7.3 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we know we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whiskey\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.

Review #1: Lagavulin 16,106,wh4yw8,https://i.redd.it/ygedh8ppbyf91.jpg,1659729948,,"[{'body': 'This is my favorite whisky in DA HOL WURLL.', 'score': 16}, {'body': ""**Review # 1 - Lagavulin 16 Year**\r  \n\r  \nThe first review! I've been thinking about this for a while, building experience and a palate over the last few years. It's finally time to start the actual reviews, and what better place to start than the whisky that got me into this hobby?\r  \n\r  \nOften my wife will review these along with me - her tasting notes, score, and anecdotes will be included in the review as well. We try to review each whisky a few times before rendering a verdict, so all of the notes and scores below will be compilations collected over the course of months or, occasionally, years. While Scotch was our first love in the world of whisk(e)y, and still remains our favorite, we will also review spirits from a variety of countries and styles.\r  \n\r  \nAs mentioned before, this is the whisky that pulled us into the hobby. On a chilly winter night, while celebrating holidays with some family, a relative poured us a glass of something new to try. My wife and I both drank mostly wine and beer at the time, with the occasional cocktail mixed in; we had both tried whisky, and while we didn't mind the taste, it had never stood out to us. This one was different: smoky, rich, fruity, coastal, even sweet.  We were intrigued, and a few days later, we found a bottle for ourselves; a few drams in, we were hooked. A little stereotypical, we know.\r  \n\r  \nAnd so it happened: like many others, Lagavulin 16 was the hook that reeled us into a new world of flavor (and expense). From the south coast of Islay, this world-renowned dram has captured the minds of many, often the first step in a long journey of learning and camaraderie built around this great hobby.\r  \n\r  \n**Lagavulin 16 Year**\r  \n\r  \nScotland/Islay - Single Malt\r  \n\r  \n**Price Paid**: USD 90\r  \n**Current Locally Available Price**: USD 93\r  \n**Age Statement**: 16 Years\r  \n**Strength**: 43%\r  \n**Cask Makeup**: Ex-Bourbon and Ex-Sherry Casks\r  \n\r  \n**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 9 months; bottles at 50%, 25%, and 100% (newly opened) fill level at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes\r  \n\r  \n**Nose**: Quite a bit going on in this nose – it’s rich, with a mixture of earthy peat smoke, savory barbecue, and plentiful fruits, some dried and some still a bit juicy. More sweet than dry, with prune and fig taking a dominant role, sometimes aided by blackberry and even a touch of orange citrus. A little bit of salt, and with that medium level of peat, this feels like a driftwood bonfire on the beach. Near the center of the glass, a touch of musty cellar, and later, red wine and dark chocolate, with mild oak influence.\r  \n\r  \n**Palate**: The complexion here mimics that of the nose: rich, dark, moderately smoky, and decent complexity. The sweetness is carried over in the form of dark red and purple fruits, some plum and maybe just a hint of dark cherry. Fig and raisin grow stronger after starting in the background, and then the chocolate and driftwood oak show up. The mouthfeel is medium, maybe bordering on thin, but is likely saved a little bit by some longer cask influence; not too oaky overall, though, and as it opens up in the glass, more of those oily barbecue sauce and campfire peat notes, joined by just a hint of earthy cellar. Possibly a hint of perfume as well.\r  \n\r  \n**Finish**: This finish is medium-long, somewhat soft overall, with just mild warmth coming through, just a bit cozy. A few dry but richly-flavored wood notes cause a prickle around the palate, and the peat is present all the time. Ends with some sweetness from vanilla and creamy chocolate, along with just a pinch of oily barbecue.\r  \n\r  \n**Final Note**: This whisky will always hold a bit of a special place in our hearts after we first tasted it; we've tried to remain as objective as possible in our rating. A fantastic whisky with mediocre presentation, we think this would be sublime at a higher strength and a bit more natural.\r  \n\r  \nOur ratings will be an average of the individual tastings we've done; we use a 0-10 scale, and allow half-point ratings in the case that we are having trouble deciding between two different scores.\r  \n\r  \n**Average Rating**: 8.5 / 10\r  \n\r  \n**Rating Scale**:\r  \n0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless\r  \n1 - At least we know we can use it in our first aid kit\r  \n2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario\r  \n3 - Low end mixing whiskey\r  \n4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail\r  \n5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat\r  \n6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity\r  \n7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail\r  \n8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price\r  \n9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted\r  \n10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can afford\r  \n\r  \nIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.\r  \n\r  \n**Value Rating**: 7.47"", 'score': 14}, {'body': ""I'm close to finishing a bottle I've been working on for a couple of years.
