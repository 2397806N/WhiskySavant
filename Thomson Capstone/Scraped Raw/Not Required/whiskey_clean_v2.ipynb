       "      <td>Morris Inaugural Aged Port Barrel\\n\\nSingle malt  whisky. 47.5% ABV. \\n\\nDistillery: Morris, Rutherglen, Victoria, Australia\\n\\nPrice: AU$165/US$106 for a 700ml bottle\\n\\nAge: NAS \\n\\nChill filtered: No\\n\\nBottled: unknown\\n\\nLimited edition: No\\n\\nMaturation: Finished in 10 Year Old Morris Port barrels\\n\\nBody: Maple syrup with ruby hues\\n\\nNose: Orange, brown sugar, dark chocolate\\n\\nPalate:  Stone fruit\\n\\nFinish: Figs, blueberries, dark chocolate\\n\\nAugust 2023's offering from The Whisky Club is the Morris Inaugural Aged Port Barrel. The whisky is finished in 10 Year Old Morris Port barrels, and while they don't note where it spends most of the maturation it is presumably American oak barrels, likely re-fill. Side note Australia can't use the word 'Port' to describe their wine and must instead use the word 'Tawny', so I'm not sure if this is a typo, or if they're importing Portuguese wine casks. As Morris produce their own fortified wines and as such have access to some super fresh barrels, I suspect it's a typo.\\n\\nThe nose is undeniably fortified wine barrels and really packs a punch. Orange is dominant, while brown sugar and softer notes of dark chocolate sit behind. \\n\\nThe palate is rich and syrupy, suggesting the finish in fortified wine was anywhere up to 12 months, but likely closer to 6 months. This shows with the lack of depth, stone fruit is evident but there's no real depth of character behind this, even with a couple of drops of water.  \\n\\nThe finish is chewy and lingering. Figs gives way to blueberries and a dark chocolate to round things out. \\n\\nOverall the Morris Aged Port Barrel is good without being great. Where Archie Rose's [A Whisky In Every Port](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/ppa3j1/40th_whisky_review_12_australian_whisky_review/) had more depth and character the Morris starts well on the nose but fails to deliver thereafter, lacking the maturation time required to really create a knockout whisky. If you're a fan of whisky matured in port casks it's worth a look, however if you're new to this type of maturation there is better out there for the price point and depth. \\n\\n**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** \\n\\nNo, it's not unique enough.\\n\\n**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** \\n\\nLikely not, there's better out there for the price point.\\n\\n**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** \\n\\nNo, it's not a great intro whisky.\\n\\n**Final Score: 75/100**\\n\\nRating Scale:\\n\\n0-50: Just bad.\\n\\n51-60: Shots only.\\n\\n61-70: Will do if there’s no better options.\\n\\n71-76: Average.\\n\\n77-82: Good (depending on price and availability, will probably \\nbuy another bottle).\\n\\n83-87: Great (a cut above).\\n\\n88-92: Excellently Crafted.\\n\\n93-96: Superior.\\n\\n97-100: Whisky Nirvana.\\n\\nAll previous reviews can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeppsDoesWhisky/comments/owah1r/all_reviews_by_udeppsdoeswhisky/).\\n\\nMy three favourites to date are \\nMy three favourites reviewed to date are [Lagavulin 16](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14voukw/64th_whisky_review_33rd_scotch_whisky_review/) (95), [Balvenie Doublewood 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/loqg67/20th_whisky_review_12th_scotch_whisky_review/) (93) and [Laphroaig Quarter Cask \\(90\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h9co01/4th_whisky_review_2nd_scotch_whisky_review/).\\n\\nMy three least favourite reviews to date are [Johnnie Walker Red \\(10\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/ljjvhc/12th_whisky_review_6th_scotch_whisky_review/), [Ned Australian Whisky \\(10\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h80o69/3rd_whisky_review_1st_australian_whisky_review/), and [Archie Rose Single Paddock Whisky Harvest 2018 \\(7\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/yd2okb/54th_whisky_review_20th_australian_whisky_review/).</td>\n",

The whisky is finished in 10 Year Old Morris Port barrels, and while they don't note where it spends most of the maturation it is presumably American oak barrels, likely re-fill. Side note Australia can't use the word 'Port' to describe their wine and must instead use the word 'Tawny', so I'm not sure if this is a typo, or if they're importing Portuguese wine casks. As Morris produce their own fortified wines and as such have access to some super fresh barrels, I suspect it's a typo.\\n\\nThe nose is undeniably fortified wine barrels and really packs a punch. Orange is dominant, while brown sugar and softer notes of dark chocolate sit behind. \\n\\nThe palate is rich and syrupy, suggesting the finish in fortified wine was anywhere up to 12 months, but likely closer to 6 months. This shows with the lack of depth, stone fruit is evident but there's no real depth of character behind this, even with a couple of drops of water.  \\n\\nThe finish is chewy and lingering. Figs gives way to blueberries and a dark chocolate to round things out. \\n\\nOverall the Morris Aged Port Barrel is good without being great. Where Archie Rose's [A Whisky In Every Port](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/ppa3j1/40th_whisky_review_12_australian_whisky_review/) had more depth and character the Morris starts well on the nose but fails to deliver thereafter, lacking the maturation time required to really create a knockout whisky. If you're a fan of whisky matured in port casks it's worth a look, however if you're new to this type of maturation there is better out there for the price point and depth. \\n\\n**Would I buy this to open in 10 years time:** \\n\\nNo, it's not unique enough.\\n\\n**Would I give this as a gift to a fellow whisky enthusiast:** \\n\\nLikely not, there's better out there for the price point.\\n\\n**Would I give this as a gift as an introductory whisky:** \\n\\nNo, it's not a great intro whisky.\\n\\n**Final Score: 75/100**\\n\\nRating Scale:\\n\\n0-50: Just bad.\\n\\n51-60: Shots only.\\n\\n61-70: Will do if there’s no better options.\\n\\n71-76: Average.\\n\\n77-82: Good (depending on price and availability, will probably \\nbuy another bottle).\\n\\n83-87: Great (a cut above).\\n\\n88-92: Excellently Crafted.\\n\\n93-96: Superior.\\n\\n97-100: Whisky Nirvana.\\n\\nAll previous reviews can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeppsDoesWhisky/comments/owah1r/all_reviews_by_udeppsdoeswhisky/).\\n\\nMy three favourites to date are \\nMy three favourites reviewed to date are [Lagavulin 16](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14voukw/64th_whisky_review_33rd_scotch_whisky_review/) (95), [Balvenie Doublewood 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/loqg67/20th_whisky_review_12th_scotch_whisky_review/) (93) and [Laphroaig Quarter Cask \\(90\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h9co01/4th_whisky_review_2nd_scotch_whisky_review/).\\n\\nMy three least favourite reviews to date are [Johnnie Walker Red \\(10\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/ljjvhc/12th_whisky_review_6th_scotch_whisky_review/), [Ned Australian Whisky \\(10\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/h80o69/3rd_whisky_review_1st_australian_whisky_review/), and [Archie Rose Single Paddock Whisky Harvest 2018 \\(7\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/yd2okb/54th_whisky_review_20th_australian_whisky_review/).  \n",

       "      <td>I like how almost every review of Blanton’s settles on “it’s fine.”Queue the “Blanton’s is overrated, Im too cool for Blanton’s” commentsI don’t believe you. Can’t find goddamn Blanton’s anywhere. Yes I’m bitter lmaoI just saw this at O’Hare duty free for $139. Hard pass.**Review #55 - Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon**Today we're looking at Blanton's, one of the most hyped yet still semi-obtainable bourbons on the market. While it should be priced around $65 according to the producer, it's not uncommon to see this upwards of $100, sometimes even closer to $200, depending on how bold the store selling it is. Because of the limited availability and premium pricing, the value here could be hindered unless we're really blown away by the taste.Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon started back in the mid-1980s, and is said to be the world's first commercially available single barrel bourbon offering. Generally aged 6 to 8 years and bottled at a solid 46.5% ABV for the standard release, we can expect plenty of flavor and some refinement/flavor development based on the specs.**Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon**USA - Bourbon**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 160**Age Statement**: NAS**Strength**: 46.5% ABV**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 8 months; bottles at 10%, 50%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes**Nose**: Pretty classic profile here - sweetness, plenty of cherry and vanilla, and a decent amount of oak. As it opens up, that wood turns slightly more dry, but other sweet notes come forward, too: mild caramel, raw sugar, brown sugar, and some pie crust. There is a little bit of dusty corn grain and old worn leather, and at the end, we're finding some wood spice and cinnamon.**Palate**: Medium mouthfeel, with plenty of oak up front, not as sweet at the nose led us to believe. There are some prickly tannins showing up at the back of the palate, but we also have nice sugar notes to pick through: maple syrup, molasses, boozy brown sugar, and caramel all come to mind. Once we even found a subtle watermelon note, but it didn't stick around too long. Generally speaking, well balanced and not too punchy.**Finish**: The finish is medium length, and there is mild heat with more of that dry oak from the palate. Light sweetness from brown sugar and baking spice, but the caramel has disappeared, leaving space for more of the dark cherry note from the nose. It's oily and makes the mouth salivate, and there is just a bit of puckering in the cheeks from the oak, maybe maple wood this time.**Final Note**: This is a nice sipper with a pretty classic bourbon profile and a few nicely developed flavor notes to dive into. Is it the most complex whisky on the market? No, far from it, but that isn't what it's meant to be, either. Is this a good value at the RRP around $65? Eh, maybe - we wouldn't mind paying that for it, but would be more comfortable paying $50 to $60. Would we be tempted to pick this up for the 'available' prices in our area, more like $100 or $150 or $200? It's a resounding 'no.'**Average Rating**: 6.6 / 10**Rating Scale**:0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario3 - Low end mixing whisky4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can affordIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.**Value Rating**: 4.75What would everyone consider to be a fair price for the standard Blanton's bourbon?Whatever your opinion might be, you have to hand it to Blantons marketing.  It’s the “ I liked them before they were cool “ of Bourbon- while disappearing for $150-$200 a bottle by me.I've had this a few times at bars and for me this one is nothing special, maybe because I just don't enjoy high rye bourbons in general.  The only reason I would buy a bottle is because it would look nice on the shelf.  But there's so many other things I would rather buy, that the times I do find this for MSRP I always end up getting something else.Good review. When I worked in the liquor industry in college an old Bourbon head said,” Blanton’s is the best $40 bourbon you’ll spend $120 on,” and that stuck with me. I’d never pass it up for the old pre-boom prices but I find it more than difficult to spend $70+ on it in any capacity, when for that price you can find superior selections around that price point. I’ll just stick to my Knob Creek and Woodfords Double Oaked for now.For a similar price I can get Larceny Barrel Proof, Knob Creek 12, Old Forester 1910 and 1920, Makers Mark wood finishing series, cask strength or 101, Dickel 13 year bottled in bond or 15 year store pick, Smoke wagon uncut unfiltered, and Elijah Craig barrel proof, 1792 bib or full proof, wild turkey rare breed, Russell's Reserve 10 year or single barrel. all of which are way easier to find and much more enjoyable. I left my Bottle of blantons at my girlfriends house because I thought she'd appreciate the bottle design. I'll have a sip when I'm there and I don't hate it but...Blantans...one of the bottles I will never pay more then SRP forIt's good, but not special, something to flex with company over and not get out your favorite stuffI’m shocked to see / hear these prices .. scored one for $60 pre XmasTrying to find Blantons for less than £130 is like being Indiana Jones. Either that or I'm just not very good at finding it.I don’t care for Blanton’s like I used to, so I saved the last of it to start my infinity bottle. Blantons straight from the barrel is a different story however… too bad my one bottle will likely be the only I find in the next 5 years lol. In Massachusetts the hype seems to be dying down. I can almost always get a bottle from my local liquor store for 2 punches in their reward program at msrp. (For context you get 2 punches buying any store pick that costs more than $55)I have had a ton of this over the last year+.  In that time,  there was only one exceptional bottle.  Most were average.  It is an easy sipper and I will always grab it when I see it.Paid $89 for it in Indiana passed up a bottle for $100 the other day but it is tasty in my opinion and by being allocated with the different letters to collect they have done a heck of a marketing jobUnder 100 I’ll buy it every time. For the most part I’ll pay 100 for any bottle if I want itI bought a bottle of rhe ECBP A123 last week for $75 plus tax.  It's barrel strength from a terrific distillery and carries a 12 year age statement.  I just can't see myself buying a younger, lower proof bourbon from a distillery that I'm generally lukewarm about.  Maybe the most direct comparison to Blanton's is WT Kentucky Spirit, both single barrels, close-ish in proof. I can get KS for $50 it's relatively easy to find, and I prefer WTs profile. That said, if you like you like it so go nuts.I am sipping some Blanton’s right now, enjoying a warm-ish sunset. Solid, tasty drink, but not worth ridiculous pricing. I can’t get it in PA. This is a bottle a friend of one gave me. Cheers all!Tried this with a cube of Ice  and it was personally my favorite bourbon so farAnywhere from 55-65 in indiana if u know a guyI would not know if Blantons is any good because I have NEVER seen a bottle in my neck of the Pacific. I have read about it but I have also read about aliens, white whales and other things that are too good or fantastical to be real. Getting serious, I also have never seen a bottle of WL Weller and numerous other bourbons I read about online. I almost feel like I have to take a trip to KY and TN just to taste this stuff, if you can actually find it there...which seems excessive until you add in there is good BBQ, lots of music and probably some other reasons to visit....At 60-80? Good bourbon, fair value for the price. At 100? OverpricedI love Blanton’s.  My love of Blanton’s is not because of the taste but what I think of when I drink it.  It has been my celebration whiskey for the past 20+ years.  Been the toast of choice through so many life events, good and bad.  Is it the best tasting?  So many have passed it in my top Bourbon list, but I HAVE to have it on hand at all times.Keep in mind now $100 is really only $30 over retail. At least here in Ohio after tax...I buy it if I see since my wife really enjoys it .But otherwise not chasing it down.Nice accurate review It’s good not great, it got notes of Carmel ,butterscotch ,vanilla , brown sugar &amp; apples.Little bit of heat but dies quickly. For the hype I’d expect a more depthful pour. But people can’t do better coz they don’t know any better.$60. It's a pleasant easy sipping bourbon in a cute bottle. Above that price there are simply too many other options that I enjoy more.Wife just bought it for me for Vday. She won’t tell me what she paid. Aka, it was over 100+I've always liked it as an after dinner drink. Three finger pour on the rocks. CheersJust won a Blantons straight from the barrel. Got it delivered today. So stoked!it is a NAS product. there is no evidence or suggestion on their website that this particular bottle is 6 to 8 years.Other bottles of blantons? yes, not this one.My first true love and still a favorite.  Hard to find in NW region.  I stashed a few bottles, would really love to find some of the other blantons bottles but those are unicorns.Great bourbon.   However in the same price range (not secondary) weller antique is a much better bourbon.Blanton’s is god tier bourbon, fight meBlantons is a bourbon for people just getting into bourbon or people that don't like bourbon.It's just has nothing to it but the hype. I wouldn't give 50 dollars retail for it. There are way better juices in that price range. People are obviously mad at their money[deleted]People were selling it in the parking lots at every Friday delivery storeI was an alcoholic college student in 2009 and would somehow afford to drink decent bourbon every night. Every now and again I’d splurge on something different. Bought this one for about $40 because the horse looked cool. Decent stuff if I recall, though I quickly shifted gears and settled back into my old grand daddy BiB.Pretty crazy that this stuff is selling like overpriced hotcakes now. In fact most of the stuff I used to splurge on is wildly expensive. What the heck happened?I was an alcoholic college student in 2009 and would somehow afford to drink decent bourbon every night.

I’ll drink ER or OF1910 over it any day of the week.Just picked up a bottle from my local whisky specialist shop for the equivalent of $90 in the UK. I've never seen a bottle cheaper than that here. Looking forward to trying it a lot, but fully prepared to think it's not quite worth that much based on what I've read.The closest I can get to having this is the Blantons's truffles, as my local LS does not sell the bourbon. Was just on Amazon and saw a seller selling a box of I think 16 truffles for almost 80 friggin dollars. Unbelieveable! (Sp.). I get them alot cheaper than that. Crooks!Sadly I can't get BT or ER anymore either. It's like Walmart, If I like something they stop selling it.All I can say is it must be nice to be able to get it. I can't and don't have a car.Yeah, his conclusion felt a lot like mine when I reviewed it. Good whiskey. Worth the hype and paying $100+…? Of course not. It’s a *good* whiskey with a cool bottle design. Insane to me that people will chase this bottle down and pay $200. I’ll happily sip WT101, Maker’s CS, and John J Bowman while I watch people pull these ridiculous stunts.I will say, Blanton’s was probably one of the first 10 bourbons I ever drank, and the first one that made me say “holy shit this is pretty good”. Then I tried about 50 more bottles and determined that it’s just good, not life changing.What is your opinion on it? Better or worse than that?For this reason. I probably won't buy another bottle for myself. I feel like I get more flavor out of lower priced bottles. For example, 10$ more I can get a whistling pig 10 year.Blanton’s is overrated, Im too cool for Blanton’sJust trying to help, ncaviolo.[deleted]Are they wrong?Edit: I took the bait, buuut blanton’s is still overhyped, mediocre bourbon that should be $40ish.I think Blanton's is good though not great. I recently finished a bottle I purchased at Buffalo Trace distillery and have another bottle I'll open soon. (Happily, both bottles were MSRP.)But you seem to be saying that anyone with a contrary opinion is automatically just a poser. I mean can't people express their opinion?I was just going to ask if it was the Kentucky kind, or the European kind most people have been gettingBut is it actually Blanton's or is it a counterfeit?It's almost like it's true ..Haha, we almost never see it anymore either, I think the easiest way to get this is by purchasing online, in which case you will definitely be overpaying these days.Oof bro I live in the Eu and I can basically always find blandons at retail lolBlanton's is whiskey for people who don't like whiskey.Liquor store near me has it for $69 but they have some sort of loyalty program for itYep, brutal. We’ve seen it a couple of times in airports for 125-150, and there are usually loads of them sitting there.You had a sealed bottle from over 5 years ago?[deleted]Got super lucky and found a Blantons’s at a Costco in Florida last week at $45. One per customer, they had 18 cases.Honestly I like it a lot, but I feel like it’s a $45-55 whiskey. I bought two bottles for $69 (75 with tax) just to have so I could try itI'm a buyer at MSRP ($60+tax in my state) and always have a few around. Its pretty good lower proof bourbon, and the bottle does look cool on the bar. Its a good pour for friends that are not up to higher proofs, and also makes a good thank you gift.$60-$80 at most.If you’re buying Blanton’s for $200+ it’s usually one of the other labels, like gold or black edition.$60$60 for me. It's good at that but I wouldn't pay any more.$60-80 is good as far as I’m concerned. Personally I love Blanton’s. The secondary pricing sucks.60 is retail in VA and IMO it’s not worth more than retail, I personally think it should be like $45-50 but that’s just me being bit picky. Actually passed on it a couple times at retail just cause I wasn’t interested enough.It's not my cup of tea and I almost never reach for the open bottle I have. That being said, I'll typically buy it when I see it at $60-$80 and hold onto it for gifts for friends that never have seen it and are clamoring for it. I'd potentially go up to $100 depending on if I have someone in mind to gift it to and whether or not I already have one on hand to give.$50 or less.I've had a bottle of it before, and no lie, it's boring. I'd legitimately pay in the $35-$40 range for it now. Wild turkey 101 beats it in my opinion and so if I'm planning to buy it, it'd have to cost around the same price as Wild turkey 101. People have strong opinions about this whiskey because prices are ridiculously high on the secondary market, but honestly for drinking it's in the $35-$40 whiskey price range in my book. I might buy it as a gift if I saw it at MSRP, but only because it's recognizable and comes in nice gift-able packaging. I wouldnt buy it for personal drinking at its current MSRP. Would much much rather have an Elijah craig barrel proof at the retail prices blantons goes for$40.Any more and you're buying hype. Yes, I know that MSRP is higher than that now. I said what I said.Hard pass at $65, Hard pass for everybody in my area too, I'm pretty sure  the stores stopped carrying itYep, they nailed it with the unique bottle design and collectible tops. One of the big reasons this has become so hyped up over the last decade.Yep, even at MSRP it definitely isn't cheap for most of us. The marketing team knocked it out of the park with the bottle design and collectible figurines, which seems to be a lot of the appeal of this whisky; for some of us, that isn't quite as important.I’m willing to accept if I’m wrong, but I’m pretty sure Blanton’s is a wheated bourbon, which would make it impossible to be high rye, since there isn’t any at all.The rest of your comment makes sense, just the high rye part is throwing me off.Thanks! Yeah, that’s a pretty good way to put it. Really solid other choices there!Tons of great alternatives at this price point! And plenty even cheaper, really...Exactly. There are ton of more readily available cask strength bourbons that just blow this away in terms of flavor and intensity.Makers Wood Finishing and Cask Strength are fucking fire and I’d probably rate both above blanton’s.what really blows my mind is that at its regular price it's about the same cost as Stagg Jr. I know which one I'd pick.There are definitely still some places out there that you can find it for a reasonable prices, it has just become much less common than before. That's a pretty decent price!In the UK market I assume? How much of the stuff makes its way over there? Genuinely have no idea about that, I know that bourbon selections were mediocre for a long time, but have been steadily growing.We did the same thing with our first bottle of Hibiki Harmony, used it for the Infinity bottle since it looks nice.Blanton's straight from the barrel - jealous! Haven't had a chance to try it yet.Yep, their branding has been a huge success.What about $100 for Mellow Corn?Yeah, that’s a good point with the ECBP. The bottles of it we’ve tried have definitely been a bit better than Blantons, generally speakingIt’s a good sipper! Enjoy your whisky and weekend, cheers!Nice! What are some others you’ve tried?Can you introduce me to your guy?Thank you!Congrats! You'll have to let us know how it is.Yeah, it's hard enough to find the standard stuff - we have never seen a bottle of any of the other versions.What is it about WA that your prefer? Not saying I disagree, just curious.That's just like, your opinion manTotally fair opinion, we all have things we like and dislike. What do you like most about it?What are you talking about? Paying 150$+ for a 60$ Bourbon doesn't mean you are better than people, it means you're stupid. People will continue to point out for those who perhaps are new to bourbon to not get caught in the hype of anything made by BT.If we’re being gatekeeping jerks - it’s more so that it’s the most basic of the “good” bourbons that taters and newbies will gladly pay $100+ for despite it being rather bland entirely because of the hype. Enjoy!I'm trying to wrap my head around what you're saying. Are you saying people who dislike blantons only dislike it because they can't afford it (or other decent bourbons)?*Laughs in $23 Weller special reserve*People who pay more than $100 for a bottle of something to drink are fools.Change my mind.You had me until WT101. Cmon man, really?this stuff is $100 now? used to walk into binnys and see an abundance for decent price. this was almost 10 yrs ago tho. Used to love this and eagle rare.I think it’s fine.  I’ll buy it all day long at retail.  I don’t always need super complex and heavy hitting. This is a higher-end bourbon that pretty much everyone can drink.  $100+ is batshit insane.Ironic considering whistle pig is a another whisky many consider good but overpricedBabe wake up. New copypastaWell said. I keep trying to find something I like more than Blanton’s and cannot.Hating Blanton’s is also hype, for some reason. The same people who parrot that Blanton’s sucks, also buy XYZ 4-year old MGP for more than a bottle of Blanton’s cost.  A little ironic. (I LOVE MGP, don’t get me wrong)YeahVery wrongI’m pretty sure a way to tell at a glance is by the proof. 93 proof is kentucky, 80 proof is internationalIm going to be honest, after getting my first bottle of blantons...I dont quite get the hype. I mean, I like it but outside of the fact that it was so hyped up when I was first getting into bourbon, and I just wanted a bottle...its not like anything super crazy. Its a good bourbon at its retail price (I'd be willing to pay maybe $10 - $15 over msrp). At a liquor store yesterday, this employee says, \"we have blantons\" and I said, \"Oh you do? Thats cool, where is it? Maybe I'll consider it.\" The guy points and shows me where it is, I legitimately laughed at him and said, \"Thats a hard no man...I'm not pay $500 for a $60 bourbon (that I already have a bottle of)\"People are high as hell if they'd pay that price for it.Absolutely not. I’m way too paranoid to buy my booze online with rare exception. And as you said, I’d be wildly overpaying. I’ve seen Blanton’s online for $200-$2000 and that’s not a typo. Fucking random ass Blanton’s super de duper special Char #4 going for $2,000 online lmao. Fuck no.I did learn a few weeks ago that Blanton’s is favored internationally and, while obviously sold in the US, the majority of that product goes overseasAnd I assume you know that retail price for Blanton’s is $56 USD?I feel like you could say that about a lot of Buffalo Trace products made from mash bill 1What the hell does that even meanSounds like ABC in FloridaReferring to the picture? No, that was a picture I found online because we don’t currently have a bottle of it. The last one we owned was dumped around 2012, but it’s been gone for a year or so now.That seems pretty fair, if we found one in the 61-75 range we would definitely at least consider picking it up, too. Just gets really tough when the price hits 3 digits!I remember scoffing at paying over $60 for Blanton’s a few years ago.  Now I wish I could find it for $90Id much rather have EHT or even Eagle Rare over Blantons out of the hyped Buffalo Trace releases.Yesterday, found a bottle...for $500...lmfao...I literally laughed at the guy and said, \"hard pass on that man, no way I'm paying $500 for a $60 bottle\".This is the same for me, though I haven't found a decently priced bottle in a long while.Amazing price! I would say it's definitely worth that with the way whisky is priced in general these days.I need to start looking at the liquor stores at Costco more oftenThat seems a pretty fair price to me. What is something you would be more willing to buy for that $69 price?Yeah, good shout for gifts - it does look nice, and even people that aren’t really into whisky will probably have heard of the brand and know about it’s reputation and collectibility.Yep that doesn’t surprise us, that’s close to the acceptable range in our mindsYep, another vote for the EC BP, it really does punch above its weight at RRP when compared to some of the other hyped bourbons these days.Completely agreeThat and John Wick…Everything I’ve read is that Blantons uses Buffalo Trace’s “mash bill 2” which is supposed to be their high rye bourbon mash bill.What do you mean by intensity?Totally agree. They are better than plenty of bourbons with an msrp of twice or more. Hopefully no one continues to find out!For sure!! But I have never seen a Stagg Jr for sale. Not at msrp, not at 1000% markup! Not in CO for whateve reasonYeah I don’t want that one hahaEagle rare, Angels envy , wellers special reserve,  Four roses , Russell’s 10 year to name a few. I’ve tried some with the glencairn  and I just can’t get past the burning but when I tried the one large ice sphere GAME CHANGERHigher proof makes the flavor more enhanced.    The W A has a more pronounced finish.[deleted]That's what it seems to be what they are saying. Which of course, is an idiotic position.They’ve started stocking Weller greens pretty regularly in my area.  It’s hands down the absolute best whiskey I’ve ever had for under $25.I'd pay 101 for GTS. All day longOnly thing I've had over $100 is Calumet 16.  Love it, worth it.  Now if I plan to mix it with  something... ya, $30 will do the trick nicely.$60-70 retail. Most stores though will charge $100 if not $150.Yeah, kinda how we feel about it, too. Nice to sip, won't blow you away, and supply/demand has just gotten out of control.Yup. Same people that say Blantons is worth $40 trip over themselves to buy 7yr willet purple top for $250I think Blanton’s is worth every penny of its MSRP. No more, no less.Right price obviously isn't the problem. People claim it's the poors that are salty, that's not true. They spend stupid money on bottles that aren't worth it as well.So really the only people that are right....are WT101 drinkers lolNo man that’s not what I meant, check out [this story]( pay as much as $80 for Blanton’s. $500? I’d walk out the door and I’m not coming back lmaoThe problem is you get some clueless tater who looked in two places and will absolutely pay the $500 so the damn practice is rewarded$500? Lunacy, store doesn’t deserve to be frequented.Acquisition cost for stores is $50.12 where I’m from, it’s not $56 retail lol.The people who spend the most money there get a raffle opportunity to buy it for $69 not anyone who walks in can buy it for the priceWait.  So this is a review of Blanton's from a bottle that you had a year ago?Are you saying that you saved a pour, or you're going from memory?  I don't understand.Can't find it for less than $120 near me....caught shit from a buddy for paying it and all I could say was.....find it for me for less anywhere in WA and I will buy it.Doesnt get tough for when it hits 3 digits....thats just hard no lolI’ll sound a little hypocritical for a second, but Hibiki. Little more due to logistics of importing Japanese whiskey. Talking domestic, ECBP (I think I got it for $58?) or RVW10yr (obviously harder to find). I’m also starting to like JDSB, so I’d probably pony up the $70 for the JDBPYeah, you’d get flamed on Facebook groups for even questioning it’s value hahaI looked it up and some sources call it wheated, while others call it high rye, and I don’t know what to believe anymore.Love it when they have a good finish - not the first thing we judge, but it makes the lasting impression and can really elevate a whisky.First all, people on a bourbon subreddit are the types of people paying a lot of money for bourbon they shouldn't, just because they don't fall for the Blanton's hype doesn't mean they can't afford it, it means they have more than enough cents () to overpay for a hyped bottle.Your aren't kidding. It's the only whiskey I keep backup bottles of.Well... That and proper 12. But that's to put me to bed. LolWhat’s your area of the country?I just think it’s funny that that’s where virtually all of the reviews land, with a few outliers on either end.... and they still buy Blanton's every time they see it at twice that $40 they love to spout off about.This exactly. I’m not a big blantons fan but I’d be super leary about buying it online or from international with the reported amount of counterfeits out there.Jesus Christ shit like this is EXACTLY why I refuse to purchase alcohol onlinewhen i see some for under $70, i pick up two or three.  but higher than that...is pushing it.it is a smooth drinking, nondescript, bourbon.In Los Angeles I can get a bottle as low as $75 but I've never seen it cheaper lolLast time I found a bottle in the ABC store in Alabama 2 years ago, it was $55.95.Ick. But still, at least it’s thereSo, this review is the summary of 3 different tastings we did:1. A bottle we owned - I received this as a gift \\~10 years ago, and I am assuming it was dumped not too far before I received with (within a year). We nursed this bottle for about 10 years before finally finishing it in 20222. A neat pour at a whisky bar - don't have the specifics on when this bottle was dumped3. Another neat pour at a different bar - also don't have the specifics for this bottleSo the tasting notes are a general combination of what we found at all 3 tastings, and the score is the average of what we gave the bottles when we tasted them.Yeah, it's tough to get at a reasonable price now. Unfortunately, I'm sure a lot doesn't even see the shelves before getting handed off to employees of stores or their friends, which will only strain supply and increase pricing more.Same in SC. It’s running around $120. Weller Special Reserve is at $90 too….crazy.I live in Olympia and find it on a semi regular basis for $75 but it fluctuates in availability. I usually find it at the grocery stores .Not too far away in Montana though I found it for about $66. I threw it under my arm convinced they didn't know what they had, since I live in Utah and it's almost impossible to find in a control state. That was six bottles ago and it's still the cheapest one I've ever found.Yeah, I guess that was kinda what we were getting at, haha. We would not buy itEverything I've heard is that JDBP is great for that price, but we can't claim to have tried it yet. Love the ECBP pick!Be careful you could be wanting to collect all the horsesThe only wheated Buffalo Trace products that I’m aware of are the Kosher, Weller, and Van Winkle products which taste nothing like Blantons to me.[deleted]Would be interesting to revisit Proper 12. Last time I had it was well before my bourbon kick. Maybe 4-5 years ago?OhioYup. Every mofo that says Blantons is overpriced will grab Blantons off the shelf for $65. FactsYeahhhhhh I’m with ya… I never have, don’t trust it.Honestly, where in LA?That’s a good price, only about $10 over 22% margin.Ya minimum to get in on it is 1k spent for a year and I think they said about 1500 ppl on the list90 for a 1.75L or the 750ml?My in-laws are in Montana/Idaho on a regular basis I will have to ask them to keep an eye out. Thanks for the suggestion! HAPPY CAKE DAY!I have the A, I just need L &amp; O so I can complete my initials Cool story bud.Same , I’m up in the Cleveland area , I haven’t seen any wellersIf it were ever on the shelf for $65For myself, an easy pass even at retail.But for others, there's a point here. Makes great gifts.The prices have been going up and it's not currently in stock for online order, but Total Wine will have the best price  yes, spend $1000 for a ***chance*** to buy one bottle for $20 less than normal750Check ohlq.com.Weller green is everywhere in northeast Ohio right now.Thank you, but cannot find at even $79.99 any where. I can buy a case if I can find it at that priceYa sounds about normal to me unfortunatelyWow nice website thanksThey don't always update the availability online. The best way to find one is to get on friendly terms with your local shops and ask them to give you a heads up when the deliveries come.Honestly, Four Rose's single barrel is just as good in my opinion and much easier to find at a reasonable priceAcme has a lot right now.  They are limiting purchases to 1 per person per day.  I’ve loaded up and have 5 right now, I might get a few more bottles.I recently heard a rumor that Buffalo trace won’t be able to allocate anymore and Weller is a Buffalo trace product.So yeah.  The more bottle I can stock up, the better.Yeah that would be clutch</td>\n",

       "221  I like how almost every review of Blanton’s settles on “it’s fine.”Queue the “Blanton’s is overrated, Im too cool for Blanton’s” commentsI don’t believe you. Can’t find goddamn Blanton’s anywhere. Yes I’m bitter lmaoI just saw this at O’Hare duty free for $139. Hard pass.**Review #55 - Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon**Today we're looking at Blanton's, one of the most hyped yet still semi-obtainable bourbons on the market. While it should be priced around $65 according to the producer, it's not uncommon to see this upwards of $100, sometimes even closer to $200, depending on how bold the store selling it is. Because of the limited availability and premium pricing, the value here could be hindered unless we're really blown away by the taste.Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon started back in the mid-1980s, and is said to be the world's first commercially available single barrel bourbon offering. Generally aged 6 to 8 years and bottled at a solid 46.5% ABV for the standard release, we can expect plenty of flavor and some refinement/flavor development based on the specs.**Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon**USA - Bourbon**Current Locally Available Price (per 750ml)**: USD 160**Age Statement**: NAS**Strength**: 46.5% ABV**Tasting Methodology**: Reviewed 3 times over 8 months; bottles at 10%, 50%, and 60% fill levels at times of review. Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass each time, rested 10-15 minutes**Nose**: Pretty classic profile here - sweetness, plenty of cherry and vanilla, and a decent amount of oak. As it opens up, that wood turns slightly more dry, but other sweet notes come forward, too: mild caramel, raw sugar, brown sugar, and some pie crust. There is a little bit of dusty corn grain and old worn leather, and at the end, we're finding some wood spice and cinnamon.**Palate**: Medium mouthfeel, with plenty of oak up front, not as sweet at the nose led us to believe. There are some prickly tannins showing up at the back of the palate, but we also have nice sugar notes to pick through: maple syrup, molasses, boozy brown sugar, and caramel all come to mind. Once we even found a subtle watermelon note, but it didn't stick around too long. Generally speaking, well balanced and not too punchy.**Finish**: The finish is medium length, and there is mild heat with more of that dry oak from the palate. Light sweetness from brown sugar and baking spice, but the caramel has disappeared, leaving space for more of the dark cherry note from the nose. It's oily and makes the mouth salivate, and there is just a bit of puckering in the cheeks from the oak, maybe maple wood this time.**Final Note**: This is a nice sipper with a pretty classic bourbon profile and a few nicely developed flavor notes to dive into. Is it the most complex whisky on the market? No, far from it, but that isn't what it's meant to be, either. Is this a good value at the RRP around $65? Eh, maybe - we wouldn't mind paying that for it, but would be more comfortable paying $50 to $60. Would we be tempted to pick this up for the 'available' prices in our area, more like $100 or $150 or $200? It's a resounding 'no.'**Average Rating**: 6.6 / 10**Rating Scale**:0 - Couldn't even get past the smell; drain pour; totally useless1 - At least we can use it in our first aid kit2 - Not even good enough to mix regularly; worst case scenario3 - Low end mixing whisky4 - Not the worst but don't buy again; put on ice; mediocre cocktail5 - Great for mixing or cocktails; mediocre neat6 - Premium cocktail; decent neat, hints of complexity7 - Good neat, refined; personally wouldn't use in a cocktail8 - Great - always have stocked on shelf if available at a reasonable price9 - One of the best whiskies we've tasted10 - Can't imagine something better; buy at any price we can affordIn the current whisky landscape of increasing prices and variable quality, we've added a value rating to our reviews that relates to the score and the available pricing of each whisky.  This roughly equates to a 0-10 scale; no reviews so far have exceeded a score of 10, although it is technically possible for the formula to produce a value rating higher than 10 with a high enough score and low enough price.**Value Rating**: 4.75What would everyone consider to be a fair price for the standard Blanton's bourbon?Whatever your opinion might be, you have to hand it to Blantons marketing.  It’s the “ I liked them before they were cool “ of Bourbon- while disappearing for $150-$200 a bottle by me.I've had this a few times at bars and for me this one is nothing special, maybe because I just don't enjoy high rye bourbons in general.  The only reason I would buy a bottle is because it would look nice on the shelf.  But there's so many other things I would rather buy, that the times I do find this for MSRP I always end up getting something else.Good review. When I worked in the liquor industry in college an old Bourbon head said,” Blanton’s is the best $40 bourbon you’ll spend $120 on,” and that stuck with me. I’d never pass it up for the old pre-boom prices but I find it more than difficult to spend $70+ on it in any capacity, when for that price you can find superior selections around that price point. I’ll just stick to my Knob Creek and Woodfords Double Oaked for now.For a similar price I can get Larceny Barrel Proof, Knob Creek 12, Old Forester 1910 and 1920, Makers Mark wood finishing series, cask strength or 101, Dickel 13 year bottled in bond or 15 year store pick, Smoke wagon uncut unfiltered, and Elijah Craig barrel proof, 1792 bib or full proof, wild turkey rare breed, Russell's Reserve 10 year or single barrel. all of which are way easier to find and much more enjoyable. I left my Bottle of blantons at my girlfriends house because I thought she'd appreciate the bottle design. I'll have a sip when I'm there and I don't hate it but...Blantans...one of the bottles I will never pay more then SRP forIt's good, but not special, something to flex with company over and not get out your favorite stuffI’m shocked to see / hear these prices .. scored one for $60 pre XmasTrying to find Blantons for less than £130 is like being Indiana Jones. Either that or I'm just not very good at finding it.I don’t care for Blanton’s like I used to, so I saved the last of it to start my infinity bottle. Blantons straight from the barrel is a different story however… too bad my one bottle will likely be the only I find in the next 5 years lol. In Massachusetts the hype seems to be dying down. I can almost always get a bottle from my local liquor store for 2 punches in their reward program at msrp. (For context you get 2 punches buying any store pick that costs more than $55)I have had a ton of this over the last year+.  In that time,  there was only one exceptional bottle.  Most were average.  It is an easy sipper and I will always grab it when I see it.Paid $89 for it in Indiana passed up a bottle for $100 the other day but it is tasty in my opinion and by being allocated with the different letters to collect they have done a heck of a marketing jobUnder 100 I’ll buy it every time. For the most part I’ll pay 100 for any bottle if I want itI bought a bottle of rhe ECBP A123 last week for $75 plus tax.  It's barrel strength from a terrific distillery and carries a 12 year age statement.  I just can't see myself buying a younger, lower proof bourbon from a distillery that I'm generally lukewarm about.  Maybe the most direct comparison to Blanton's is WT Kentucky Spirit, both single barrels, close-ish in proof. I can get KS for $50 it's relatively easy to find, and I prefer WTs profile. That said, if you like you like it so go nuts.I am sipping some Blanton’s right now, enjoying a warm-ish sunset. Solid, tasty drink, but not worth ridiculous pricing. I can’t get it in PA. This is a bottle a friend of one gave me. Cheers all!Tried this with a cube of Ice  and it was personally my favorite bourbon so farAnywhere from 55-65 in indiana if u know a guyI would not know if Blantons is any good because I have NEVER seen a bottle in my neck of the Pacific. I have read about it but I have also read about aliens, white whales and other things that are too good or fantastical to be real. Getting serious, I also have never seen a bottle of WL Weller and numerous other bourbons I read about online. I almost feel like I have to take a trip to KY and TN just to taste this stuff, if you can actually find it there...which seems excessive until you add in there is good BBQ, lots of music and probably some other reasons to visit....At 60-80? Good bourbon, fair value for the price. At 100? OverpricedI love Blanton’s.  My love of Blanton’s is not because of the taste but what I think of when I drink it.  It has been my celebration whiskey for the past 20+ years.  Been the toast of choice through so many life events, good and bad.  Is it the best tasting?  So many have passed it in my top Bourbon list, but I HAVE to have it on hand at all times.Keep in mind now $100 is really only $30 over retail. At least here in Ohio after tax...I buy it if I see since my wife really enjoys it .But otherwise not chasing it down.Nice accurate review It’s good not great, it got notes of Carmel ,butterscotch ,vanilla , brown sugar & apples.Little bit of heat but dies quickly. For the hype I’d expect a more depthful pour. But people can’t do better coz they don’t know any better.$60. It's a pleasant easy sipping bourbon in a cute bottle. Above that price there are simply too many other options that I enjoy more.Wife just bought it for me for Vday. She won’t tell me what she paid. Aka, it was over 100+I've always liked it as an after dinner drink. Three finger pour on the rocks. CheersJust won a Blantons straight from the barrel. Got it delivered today. So stoked!it is a NAS product. there is no evidence or suggestion on their website that this particular bottle is 6 to 8 years.Other bottles of blantons? yes, not this one.My first true love and still a favorite.  Hard to find in NW region.  I stashed a few bottles, would really love to find some of the other blantons bottles but those are unicorns.Great bourbon.   However in the same price range (not secondary) weller antique is a much better bourbon.Blanton’s is god tier bourbon, fight meBlantons is a bourbon for people just getting into bourbon or people that don't like bourbon.It's just has nothing to it but the hype. I wouldn't give 50 dollars retail for it. There are way better juices in that price range. People are obviously mad at their money[deleted]People were selling it in the parking lots at every Friday delivery storeI was an alcoholic college student in 2009 and would somehow afford to drink decent bourbon every night. Every now and again I’d splurge on something different. Bought this one for about $40 because the horse looked cool. Decent stuff if I recall, though I quickly shifted gears and settled back into my old grand daddy BiB.Pretty crazy that this stuff is selling like overpriced hotcakes now. In fact most of the stuff I used to splurge on is wildly expensive. What the heck happened?I was an alcoholic college student in 2009 and would somehow afford to drink decent bourbon every night.

I’ll drink ER or OF1910 over it any day of the week.Just picked up a bottle from my local whisky specialist shop for the equivalent of $90 in the UK. I've never seen a bottle cheaper than that here. Looking forward to trying it a lot, but fully prepared to think it's not quite worth that much based on what I've read.The closest I can get to having this is the Blantons's truffles, as my local LS does not sell the bourbon. Was just on Amazon and saw a seller selling a box of I think 16 truffles for almost 80 friggin dollars. Unbelieveable! (Sp.). I get them alot cheaper than that. Crooks!Sadly I can't get BT or ER anymore either. It's like Walmart, If I like something they stop selling it.All I can say is it must be nice to be able to get it. I can't and don't have a car.Yeah, his conclusion felt a lot like mine when I reviewed it. Good whiskey. Worth the hype and paying $100+…? Of course not. It’s a *good* whiskey with a cool bottle design. Insane to me that people will chase this bottle down and pay $200. I’ll happily sip WT101, Maker’s CS, and John J Bowman while I watch people pull these ridiculous stunts.I will say, Blanton’s was probably one of the first 10 bourbons I ever drank, and the first one that made me say “holy shit this is pretty good”. Then I tried about 50 more bottles and determined that it’s just good, not life changing.What is your opinion on it? Better or worse than that?For this reason. I probably won't buy another bottle for myself. I feel like I get more flavor out of lower priced bottles. For example, 10$ more I can get a whistling pig 10 year.Blanton’s is overrated, Im too cool for Blanton’sJust trying to help, ncaviolo.[deleted]Are they wrong?Edit: I took the bait, buuut blanton’s is still overhyped, mediocre bourbon that should be $40ish.I think Blanton's is good though not great. I recently finished a bottle I purchased at Buffalo Trace distillery and have another bottle I'll open soon. (Happily, both bottles were MSRP.)But you seem to be saying that anyone with a contrary opinion is automatically just a poser. I mean can't people express their opinion?I was just going to ask if it was the Kentucky kind, or the European kind most people have been gettingBut is it actually Blanton's or is it a counterfeit?It's almost like it's true ..Haha, we almost never see it anymore either, I think the easiest way to get this is by purchasing online, in which case you will definitely be overpaying these days.Oof bro I live in the Eu and I can basically always find blandons at retail lolBlanton's is whiskey for people who don't like whiskey.Liquor store near me has it for $69 but they have some sort of loyalty program for itYep, brutal. We’ve seen it a couple of times in airports for 125-150, and there are usually loads of them sitting there.You had a sealed bottle from over 5 years ago?[deleted]Got super lucky and found a Blantons’s at a Costco in Florida last week at $45. One per customer, they had 18 cases.Honestly I like it a lot, but I feel like it’s a $45-55 whiskey. I bought two bottles for $69 (75 with tax) just to have so I could try itI'm a buyer at MSRP ($60+tax in my state) and always have a few around. Its pretty good lower proof bourbon, and the bottle does look cool on the bar. Its a good pour for friends that are not up to higher proofs, and also makes a good thank you gift.$60-$80 at most.If you’re buying Blanton’s for $200+ it’s usually one of the other labels, like gold or black edition.$60$60 for me. It's good at that but I wouldn't pay any more.$60-80 is good as far as I’m concerned. Personally I love Blanton’s. The secondary pricing sucks.60 is retail in VA and IMO it’s not worth more than retail, I personally think it should be like $45-50 but that’s just me being bit picky. Actually passed on it a couple times at retail just cause I wasn’t interested enough.It's not my cup of tea and I almost never reach for the open bottle I have. That being said, I'll typically buy it when I see it at $60-$80 and hold onto it for gifts for friends that never have seen it and are clamoring for it. I'd potentially go up to $100 depending on if I have someone in mind to gift it to and whether or not I already have one on hand to give.$50 or less.I've had a bottle of it before, and no lie, it's boring. I'd legitimately pay in the $35-$40 range for it now. Wild turkey 101 beats it in my opinion and so if I'm planning to buy it, it'd have to cost around the same price as Wild turkey 101. People have strong opinions about this whiskey because prices are ridiculously high on the secondary market, but honestly for drinking it's in the $35-$40 whiskey price range in my book. I might buy it as a gift if I saw it at MSRP, but only because it's recognizable and comes in nice gift-able packaging. I wouldnt buy it for personal drinking at its current MSRP. Would much much rather have an Elijah craig barrel proof at the retail prices blantons goes for$40.Any more and you're buying hype. Yes, I know that MSRP is higher than that now. I said what I said.Hard pass at $65, Hard pass for everybody in my area too, I'm pretty sure  the stores stopped carrying itYep, they nailed it with the unique bottle design and collectible tops. One of the big reasons this has become so hyped up over the last decade.Yep, even at MSRP it definitely isn't cheap for most of us. The marketing team knocked it out of the park with the bottle design and collectible figurines, which seems to be a lot of the appeal of this whisky; for some of us, that isn't quite as important.I’m willing to accept if I’m wrong, but I’m pretty sure Blanton’s is a wheated bourbon, which would make it impossible to be high rye, since there isn’t any at all.The rest of your comment makes sense, just the high rye part is throwing me off.Thanks! Yeah, that’s a pretty good way to put it. Really solid other choices there!Tons of great alternatives at this price point! And plenty even cheaper, really...Exactly. There are ton of more readily available cask strength bourbons that just blow this away in terms of flavor and intensity.Makers Wood Finishing and Cask Strength are fucking fire and I’d probably rate both above blanton’s.what really blows my mind is that at its regular price it's about the same cost as Stagg Jr. I know which one I'd pick.There are definitely still some places out there that you can find it for a reasonable prices, it has just become much less common than before. That's a pretty decent price!In the UK market I assume? How much of the stuff makes its way over there? Genuinely have no idea about that, I know that bourbon selections were mediocre for a long time, but have been steadily growing.We did the same thing with our first bottle of Hibiki Harmony, used it for the Infinity bottle since it looks nice.Blanton's straight from the barrel - jealous! Haven't had a chance to try it yet.Yep, their branding has been a huge success.What about $100 for Mellow Corn?Yeah, that’s a good point with the ECBP. The bottles of it we’ve tried have definitely been a bit better than Blantons, generally speakingIt’s a good sipper! Enjoy your whisky and weekend, cheers!Nice! What are some others you’ve tried?Can you introduce me to your guy?Thank you!Congrats! You'll have to let us know how it is.Yeah, it's hard enough to find the standard stuff - we have never seen a bottle of any of the other versions.What is it about WA that your prefer? Not saying I disagree, just curious.That's just like, your opinion manTotally fair opinion, we all have things we like and dislike. What do you like most about it?What are you talking about? Paying 150$+ for a 60$ Bourbon doesn't mean you are better than people, it means you're stupid. People will continue to point out for those who perhaps are new to bourbon to not get caught in the hype of anything made by BT.If we’re being gatekeeping jerks - it’s more so that it’s the most basic of the “good” bourbons that taters and newbies will gladly pay $100+ for despite it being rather bland entirely because of the hype. Enjoy!I'm trying to wrap my head around what you're saying. Are you saying people who dislike blantons only dislike it because they can't afford it (or other decent bourbons)?*Laughs in $23 Weller special reserve*People who pay more than $100 for a bottle of something to drink are fools.Change my mind.You had me until WT101. Cmon man, really?this stuff is $100 now? used to walk into binnys and see an abundance for decent price. this was almost 10 yrs ago tho. Used to love this and eagle rare.I think it’s fine.  I’ll buy it all day long at retail.  I don’t always need super complex and heavy hitting. This is a higher-end bourbon that pretty much everyone can drink.  $100+ is batshit insane.Ironic considering whistle pig is a another whisky many consider good but overpricedBabe wake up. New copypastaWell said. I keep trying to find something I like more than Blanton’s and cannot.Hating Blanton’s is also hype, for some reason. The same people who parrot that Blanton’s sucks, also buy XYZ 4-year old MGP for more than a bottle of Blanton’s cost.  A little ironic. (I LOVE MGP, don’t get me wrong)YeahVery wrongI’m pretty sure a way to tell at a glance is by the proof. 93 proof is kentucky, 80 proof is internationalIm going to be honest, after getting my first bottle of blantons...I dont quite get the hype. I mean, I like it but outside of the fact that it was so hyped up when I was first getting into bourbon, and I just wanted a bottle...its not like anything super crazy. Its a good bourbon at its retail price (I'd be willing to pay maybe $10 - $15 over msrp). At a liquor store yesterday, this employee says, \"we have blantons\" and I said, \"Oh you do? Thats cool, where is it? Maybe I'll consider it.\" The guy points and shows me where it is, I legitimately laughed at him and said, \"Thats a hard no man...I'm not pay $500 for a $60 bourbon (that I already have a bottle of)\"People are high as hell if they'd pay that price for it.Absolutely not. I’m way too paranoid to buy my booze online with rare exception. And as you said, I’d be wildly overpaying. I’ve seen Blanton’s online for $200-$2000 and that’s not a typo. Fucking random ass Blanton’s super de duper special Char #4 going for $2,000 online lmao. Fuck no.I did learn a few weeks ago that Blanton’s is favored internationally and, while obviously sold in the US, the majority of that product goes overseasAnd I assume you know that retail price for Blanton’s is $56 USD?I feel like you could say that about a lot of Buffalo Trace products made from mash bill 1What the hell does that even meanSounds like ABC in FloridaReferring to the picture? No, that was a picture I found online because we don’t currently have a bottle of it. The last one we owned was dumped around 2012, but it’s been gone for a year or so now.That seems pretty fair, if we found one in the 61-75 range we would definitely at least consider picking it up, too. Just gets really tough when the price hits 3 digits!I remember scoffing at paying over $60 for Blanton’s a few years ago.  Now I wish I could find it for $90Id much rather have EHT or even Eagle Rare over Blantons out of the hyped Buffalo Trace releases.Yesterday, found a bottle...for $500...lmfao...I literally laughed at the guy and said, \"hard pass on that man, no way I'm paying $500 for a $60 bottle\".This is the same for me, though I haven't found a decently priced bottle in a long while.Amazing price! I would say it's definitely worth that with the way whisky is priced in general these days.I need to start looking at the liquor stores at Costco more oftenThat seems a pretty fair price to me. What is something you would be more willing to buy for that $69 price?Yeah, good shout for gifts - it does look nice, and even people that aren’t really into whisky will probably have heard of the brand and know about it’s reputation and collectibility.Yep that doesn’t surprise us, that’s close to the acceptable range in our mindsYep, another vote for the EC BP, it really does punch above its weight at RRP when compared to some of the other hyped bourbons these days.Completely agreeThat and John Wick…Everything I’ve read is that Blantons uses Buffalo Trace’s “mash bill 2” which is supposed to be their high rye bourbon mash bill.What do you mean by intensity?Totally agree. They are better than plenty of bourbons with an msrp of twice or more. Hopefully no one continues to find out!For sure!! But I have never seen a Stagg Jr for sale. Not at msrp, not at 1000% markup! Not in CO for whateve reasonYeah I don’t want that one hahaEagle rare, Angels envy , wellers special reserve,  Four roses , Russell’s 10 year to name a few. I’ve tried some with the glencairn  and I just can’t get past the burning but when I tried the one large ice sphere GAME CHANGERHigher proof makes the flavor more enhanced.    The W A has a more pronounced finish.[deleted]That's what it seems to be what they are saying. Which of course, is an idiotic position.They’ve started stocking Weller greens pretty regularly in my area.  It’s hands down the absolute best whiskey I’ve ever had for under $25.I'd pay 101 for GTS. All day longOnly thing I've had over $100 is Calumet 16.  Love it, worth it.  Now if I plan to mix it with  something... ya, $30 will do the trick nicely.$60-70 retail. Most stores though will charge $100 if not $150.Yeah, kinda how we feel about it, too. Nice to sip, won't blow you away, and supply/demand has just gotten out of control.Yup. Same people that say Blantons is worth $40 trip over themselves to buy 7yr willet purple top for $250I think Blanton’s is worth every penny of its MSRP. No more, no less.Right price obviously isn't the problem. People claim it's the poors that are salty, that's not true. They spend stupid money on bottles that aren't worth it as well.So really the only people that are right....are WT101 drinkers lolNo man that’s not what I meant, check out [this story]( pay as much as $80 for Blanton’s. $500? I’d walk out the door and I’m not coming back lmaoThe problem is you get some clueless tater who looked in two places and will absolutely pay the $500 so the damn practice is rewarded$500? Lunacy, store doesn’t deserve to be frequented.Acquisition cost for stores is $50.12 where I’m from, it’s not $56 retail lol.The people who spend the most money there get a raffle opportunity to buy it for $69 not anyone who walks in can buy it for the priceWait.  So this is a review of Blanton's from a bottle that you had a year ago?Are you saying that you saved a pour, or you're going from memory?  I don't understand.Can't find it for less than $120 near me....caught shit from a buddy for paying it and all I could say was.....find it for me for less anywhere in WA and I will buy it.Doesnt get tough for when it hits 3 digits....thats just hard no lolI’ll sound a little hypocritical for a second, but Hibiki. Little more due to logistics of importing Japanese whiskey. Talking domestic, ECBP (I think I got it for $58?) or RVW10yr (obviously harder to find). I’m also starting to like JDSB, so I’d probably pony up the $70 for the JDBPYeah, you’d get flamed on Facebook groups for even questioning it’s value hahaI looked it up and some sources call it wheated, while others call it high rye, and I don’t know what to believe anymore.Love it when they have a good finish - not the first thing we judge, but it makes the lasting impression and can really elevate a whisky.First all, people on a bourbon subreddit are the types of people paying a lot of money for bourbon they shouldn't, just because they don't fall for the Blanton's hype doesn't mean they can't afford it, it means they have more than enough cents () to overpay for a hyped bottle.Your aren't kidding. It's the only whiskey I keep backup bottles of.Well... That and proper 12. But that's to put me to bed. LolWhat’s your area of the country?I just think it’s funny that that’s where virtually all of the reviews land, with a few outliers on either end.... and they still buy Blanton's every time they see it at twice that $40 they love to spout off about.This exactly. I’m not a big blantons fan but I’d be super leary about buying it online or from international with the reported amount of counterfeits out there.Jesus Christ shit like this is EXACTLY why I refuse to purchase alcohol onlinewhen i see some for under $70, i pick up two or three.  but higher than that...is pushing it.it is a smooth drinking, nondescript, bourbon.In Los Angeles I can get a bottle as low as $75 but I've never seen it cheaper lolLast time I found a bottle in the ABC store in Alabama 2 years ago, it was $55.95.Ick. But still, at least it’s thereSo, this review is the summary of 3 different tastings we did:1. A bottle we owned - I received this as a gift \\~10 years ago, and I am assuming it was dumped not too far before I received with (within a year). We nursed this bottle for about 10 years before finally finishing it in 20222. A neat pour at a whisky bar - don't have the specifics on when this bottle was dumped3. Another neat pour at a different bar - also don't have the specifics for this bottleSo the tasting notes are a general combination of what we found at all 3 tastings, and the score is the average of what we gave the bottles when we tasted them.Yeah, it's tough to get at a reasonable price now. Unfortunately, I'm sure a lot doesn't even see the shelves before getting handed off to employees of stores or their friends, which will only strain supply and increase pricing more.Same in SC. It’s running around $120. Weller Special Reserve is at $90 too….crazy.I live in Olympia and find it on a semi regular basis for $75 but it fluctuates in availability. I usually find it at the grocery stores .Not too far away in Montana though I found it for about $66. I threw it under my arm convinced they didn't know what they had, since I live in Utah and it's almost impossible to find in a control state. That was six bottles ago and it's still the cheapest one I've ever found.Yeah, I guess that was kinda what we were getting at, haha. We would not buy itEverything I've heard is that JDBP is great for that price, but we can't claim to have tried it yet. Love the ECBP pick!Be careful you could be wanting to collect all the horsesThe only wheated Buffalo Trace products that I’m aware of are the Kosher, Weller, and Van Winkle products which taste nothing like Blantons to me.[deleted]Would be interesting to revisit Proper 12. Last time I had it was well before my bourbon kick. Maybe 4-5 years ago?OhioYup. Every mofo that says Blantons is overpriced will grab Blantons off the shelf for $65. FactsYeahhhhhh I’m with ya… I never have, don’t trust it.Honestly, where in LA?That’s a good price, only about $10 over 22% margin.Ya minimum to get in on it is 1k spent for a year and I think they said about 1500 ppl on the list90 for a 1.75L or the 750ml?My in-laws are in Montana/Idaho on a regular basis I will have to ask them to keep an eye out. Thanks for the suggestion! HAPPY CAKE DAY!I have the A, I just need L & O so I can complete my initials Cool story bud.Same , I’m up in the Cleveland area , I haven’t seen any wellersIf it were ever on the shelf for $65For myself, an easy pass even at retail.But for others, there's a point here. Makes great gifts.The prices have been going up and it's not currently in stock for online order, but Total Wine will have the best price  yes, spend $1000 for a ***chance*** to buy one bottle for $20 less than normal750Check ohlq.com.Weller green is everywhere in northeast Ohio right now.Thank you, but cannot find at even $79.99 any where. I can buy a case if I can find it at that priceYa sounds about normal to me unfortunatelyWow nice website thanksThey don't always update the availability online. The best way to find one is to get on friendly terms with your local shops and ask them to give you a heads up when the deliveries come.Honestly, Four Rose's single barrel is just as good in my opinion and much easier to find at a reasonable priceAcme has a lot right now.  They are limiting purchases to 1 per person per day.  I’ve loaded up and have 5 right now, I might get a few more bottles.I recently heard a rumor that Buffalo trace won’t be able to allocate anymore and Weller is a Buffalo trace product.So yeah.  The more bottle I can stock up, the better.Yeah that would be clutch  "
