"Tasting No. 74 - Bowmore 12yo (OB, circa 2004, 40% ABV)",,https://i.redd.it/cagyzx4iidqc1.jpeg,"*Tasting No. 73 - Bowmore 12yo (OB, circa 2004, 40% ABV)*

*Bowmore etched itself into the upper echelon of my preferences early on, with its 15yo ""Darkest"" expression being my convincing and irreversible tipover point into peated whiskies. The venerable distillery's core range is uninspiring when compared with its distillate's resultant glory in independent bottlers' hands (SMWS-bottled 17yo in refill ex-bourbon notes forthcoming) or even when presented at cask strength with minimal cask fiddling: my trip to Islay (and Bowmore's No. 1 Vaults) last autumn redoubled my enthusiasm for 'untampered-with Bowmore'--which this bottle is distinctly not.*

*This bottle dates to circa 2003, and possibly as late as 2006, according to Whiskybase--meaning the distillate came off the stills as early as 1991, or possibly 1994 (it seems Bowmore changed its label around the 2006 mark). This core range offering was bottled at the standard 40% and is likely artificially colored and chillfiltered.*

**Nose**:  Sodden paper, old coffee grounds, and the damp old cardboard note I often get with certain distilleries with sherry influence ([Loch Lomond 12yo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/13v17sd/tasting_no_32_loch_lomond_ob_12yo_46/) being chief in mind). Slightly rotten plums mix with stewed raisin and prune, with a fermenting, slightly garbage-y and spirity apple note lingering below--cider turning rancid. A bare wisp of smoke and wet old logs--but, with some time, the relievingly positive turn to some clean earthiness and distinct peat character: essence of Bowmore distillate locking itself in. With the smokiness comes sun-warmed rubber and a waft of paint thinner, washed away with slightly over-steeped black tea.

**Mouthfeel**: It was naturally somewhat thin in the mouth at 40%, but despite that was surprisingly flavorful. Certain parts of the finish stuck around (generally not those I might have preferred), but it speaks to the distillate that it can stand up to the mistreatment and still be better than acceptable. It was utterly heatless in the mouth and utterly likely to outperform if bottled at 46%.

**Taste**: Thank goodness: it is far better than the nose. None of the sherry-induced foulness or rot notes present, and it's full of good flavor. Damp tobacco, leather armchair, and freshly smoked pipe. Cigar wrappers and cedar wood, burnt citrus--all on a lovely cushion of moderate peat smoke. The aroma of burning rubber, hot beach stones, hot tar or asphalt, and a tinge of warm plastic. New roads under a hot sun. Drying now, with the asphalt lingering just slightly more potently than the smokes. Smoky ships' planks, charred cedar sticks...some notes of very quaffable sherry-ness: black walnut bitters, salted smoked paprika almonds, old milk chocolate, stale raisins, a wee spritz of lemon oil and maybe the charred orange peel plucked from a cocktail bar.

**Finish**:  Dates fried darkly in butter, a tiny bit of tire rubber, and smoke that is now definitively coalsmoke. Loads of hot asphalt with some salty copper, extinguished wicks still smoldering, more burnt planks...finishes on distinct warm leather and still-warm tobacco pipe.

**Score**: 81
Everytime I see a smws bowmore I grab it no questions asked
I guess I would have been concerned with this bottle.

Usually damp cardboard is associated with a cork problem.

The rancid fruit/garbage type notes, I would almost equate to a sulfur issue.

Given what you wrote, at least there were some redeeming elements in the taste notes however.
*My tasting evaluation system aims to evaluate whiskies sampled relative to my personal enjoyment, which skews towards moderately peated and nuanced whiskies with long finishes and lighter, intriguing subtleties emerging from within smoke. I categorize each whisky relative to others that I have enjoyed approximately that much within designated scoring bands. What I am looking for as I taste is:*

* Balance (cask/distillate, peat/distillate, cask/peat, flavors...)
* Complexity
* Pleasingness (flavor, lack of off-notes, finish, mouthfeel & texture, general enjoyability)
* Integration (alcohol, peat, cask)

The cork was in amazingly perfect condition. The association is damp cardboard, but it’s a note I often get with heavy sherry, to include in the core range Bunnahabhain NAS and the aforementioned Loch Lomond. Sulfur in the Sherry casks is certainly feasible. Despite those, it did eke out a passing grade.
I had some of this not long ago that had both the damp cardboard and the soap. 

At the end of the day, I wasn't sure if it was spoiled, but I did know that I didn't enjoy it and so I didn't finish it.
I've also found cardboard & musty newspaper notes pop up a fair bit in older bottles at auction; the cork can be in great shape but those notes can develop if the bottles have been stored in some guy's cupboard or​ basement for years & years.
They do have Loch Lomond 12, 14 and 18 in one of the stores by me.  

Given my love of Glen Scotia (I do not get any cardboard notes from Victoriana), I will have to pick up a couple of Loch Lomond core range bottles once and see if I observe the cardboard note that you do.

Everything I've ever read about it in the past, and from my own experience with an Ancnoc Rascan that was old and had a dried out/deteriorated cork, that was always the cardboard note. 

It will be interesting for me to see if it is a standard nose/taste note in Loch Lomond itself.
The soap was what I wondered about. I don't have any experience with early 90s Bowmore to know what's lavender free and what isn't.
I guess it depends on the type and potency of the lavender.

I always picked up a very mild heather/lavender note from the Deanston 12 bottle I had, but it was a lovely compliment to the other notes from the malt.

I have read stories of some earlier Edradour bottles though that were indeed potent soap lol."
"Tasting No. 73 - ""Peatside""/""The Vatting"" 6yo vatted malt (Murray McDavid, 2010-2016, 46% ABV)",,https://i.redd.it/gkxpdwtmgqoc1.jpeg,"*Tasting No. 73 - ""Peatside""/""The Vatting"" 6yo vatted malt (Murray McDavid, 2010-2016, 46% ABV)*

*This young peated Murray McDavid vatted malt combines single malts from undisclosed distilleries all distilled in 2010 and matured in ex-bourbon, with finishes in a undisclosed proportion of port and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks for a total of 6 years of age. A USA exclusive, this is bottled at 46%, non-chillfiltered and naturally colored, and is batch 003 of the line.*

**Nose**: Earthy peat, damp dunnage floor, and pronounced wet sherry wood. Burnt cranberry jam spread on very crunchy toast, a slice or two of toffee-swirled cake, and lavender-strewn tart tatin. 

**Mouthfeel**: Quite silky, if not exactly thick--quite lacking in youthful heat for some young malts being in this.

**Taste**: Molten caramel-center chocolate cake, the deep sweetness of darkly roasted carrots, and rich port syrup. A cocoa-based cocktail shaken with port and ice and domed with some farm equipment exhaust fumes. Very loud casks here, but it's a very pleasant ride. Heavy on the decadent desserts with that streak of--I infer Highland--peatsmoke that keeps things interesting. Gobs of caramel overtake the smoke eventually, and some flakes of Maldon salt atop a centerpiece tower of chocolate truffles, with a tiny glass of funky port served aside. Becomes a bit wood stemmy at times, but mostly on the nose. I see this as a reimagined Ardbeg An Oa, with lovely smoke and notable wine cask influence, but lacking the darkly savory dirty grill qualities and coastal aspect of Ardbeg.

**Finish**:  Finishes on blackberry liqueur, damp clay, and cleanly smoked barley. Echoes of the earthy  Highland peat of Port Charlotte, especially with the wine influence--but certainly louder casks here and less complexity and farminess. Closes out on pure fired-peat smoke and gentle salinity, and that lingering dessert background richness of Sachertorte, caramel-core sea salt truffles, and burning twigs.

"Tasting No. 72 - ""Party in an Island Smokehouse"" Highland Park 13yo (2008-2022, SMWS 4.327, 60.4% ABV)",,https://i.redd.it/oaqz6rn99zhc1.jpeg,"*Tasting No. 72 - ""Party in an Island Smokehouse"" Highland Park 13yo (2008-2022, SMWS 4.327, 60.4% ABV)*

*This Highland Park, distilled in January 2008, was matured for 9 years in a ex-bourbon hogshead, reracked in a 1st fill ex-bourbon barrel, and then and bottled in 2022 after 13 total years of maturation. It is bottled as one of SMWS' ""Lightly Peated"" flavor profile, 1 of 246 bottles, and was acquired as part of the ""Flavour Fireworks bundle, which also included ""*[A Coastal Breeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/18sfysb/tasting_no_63_a_coastal_breeze_caol_ila_10yo/)*,"" ""*[Reverberating Bass Notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/184alwp/tasting_no_61_reverberating_bass_notes_blair/)*,"" ""*[Autumn Pursuits](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/183qrjd/tasting_no_59_autumn_pursuits_tullibardine_9yo/)*,"" and the yet-unreviewed ""Leather Bag in a Marketplace.""*

**Nose**: Lovely floral, jasmine dance of honeysuckle. Runny honey and blossoms and some gentle sweetness from the 4 years in 1st-fill ex-bourbon. Jasmine lozenges and violet pastilles, warm heather-studded candles, soft leather, piles of straw, and a squonk of lemon cleanser. More of beeswax and honeycomb, an underripe slice of pineapple, and a few globs of clay. Very clean, balanced sweetness and dryness...smoke is quite reticent on the nose.

**Mouthfeel**: Benefits from a few ml of water, to be sure, as bigger sips are a touch hot. Oily yet light in the mouth--nearly effervescent...floats like a well-emulsified zabaglione; quite spritzy yet really very fat in the mouth too. Dilution begets a swirling ballet of swimming, oily haze in the glass.

**Taste**: There's the smoke, hiding behind a mountain of fruits. Succulent and juicy fruit gums--very explosive fruit and gorse, backed by light earthy peat. The balance of light smoke and very tropical fruitiness here is very, very nice--adept at the level of the OB Springbank 10yo. Some pineapple core and fruit skins and piths--rather a Japanese highball feel. The smoke clings nicely. Honeycomb, some rum over vanilla ice cream, topped with halwa flecks and a few dried cranberries. The cask influence is really nice here, and though dilution amplifies the oak a hair, the buttery, floral qualities of the ex-bourbon remain strong. 

**Finish**: The peat lingers long after the florals fade away, and oak tannins remain too. A bit of lemon product and kiln smoke (smoked limoncello). Bonfire with wet wood, herb-intaglioed logs steaming and spitting. Lemon thyme, bitter herbals, and wet oak tannins finish out.

**Mental image**: Refuge in a bivouac during an autumn drencher

**Score**: 86

Not the absolute best Highland Park I've had, but still very competent, lovely cask-distillate balance, and full of interest.

"Tastings No. 68-71: Bunnahabhain Warehouse No. 1 (20yo ex-rum Moine, 9yo ex-Canasta, 10yo ex-bourbon, 9 yo ex-Oloroso)",,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1adipnj,"*Tastings No. 68 - 71: Bunnahabhain Warehouse Experience, October 2023 | 10yo ex-bourbon, 9 yo ex-Oloroso, 9yo ex-Canasta, 20yo ex-rum Moine*

*These four drams were drawn from warehouse casks at Bunnahabhain Distillery near Port Askaig on Islay in October 2023. It was a chilly, clear afternoon, and Warehouse No. 9 was cold (as was the whisky), but at least the walls blocked the wind. These drams were enjoyed in a copita glass under a woolen blanket on, interestingly, old church pews used for this purpose inside the silent warehouse. There was a fifth whisky, an ex-Jim Beam cask Moine distilled in 2011, about which I took no notes and opted to enjoy there in its glorious entirety rather than bottle the remnants of for home. It was also sublime, and I regret nothing.* 
_________________________________________________________________

*Tasting No. 68: Bunnahabhain 10yo ex-Wild Turkey bourbon cask (2013-2023, 56.8% ABV)*

**Nose**: Lovely, light, and abundantly floral: jasmine tea and candles. Some stone dust, crisp fruits...wonderfully bright. Some buttery oat crumble, apple blossoms and green apple skin. 

**Mouthfeel**: Rather flawless--oily and viscous.

**Taste**: Crisp tart apple and starched linen. Lavender-infused creme patisserie and freshly milled oat dust, aromatic jasmine spritzer, orange blossom water, and faint rose oil. Sunny, crisp, artfully perfumed, and bearing an extraordinary balance of sweetness and dryness.

**Finish**: Summer-warmed gardens, blossom-laden air, aromatic creams some floral waxes, and more buttery oat.

**Score**: 89

*Tasting No. 69: Bunnahabhain 9yo ex-Oloroso cask (2014-2023, 60.8% ABV)*

**Nose**: Very nutty--acorn flour, molasses, wholemeal soda bread with Marmite, damp hay in warm stables. Slightly fermentary, of mead and active leaven drizzled with blossom honey. Some interesting soy and fried scallion.

**Mouthfeel**: Quite nice, though a few drops of water do no damage to the viscousness. 

**Taste**: Thatched roof near the coast--rising salty tide near a rustic soda bread thick with bran and molasses baking on a crude hob. A maple cocktail--dry and sweet and darkly of deep woods and syrups. Clove and nutmeg, and, taking a turn to the savory, some black pepper jerky.

**Finish**: Soft, wet woods, allspice and clove, and more maple twigs.

_________________________________________________________________

*Tasting No. 70: Bunnahabhain 9yo ex-Canasta sherry cask (2014-2023, 56.8% ABV)*

Canasta is a cream sherry--a blend of Oloroso and Pedro Ximénez. 

**Nose**: Coming from the Oloroso expression, this was an earthquake of difference: hot, pungent metallics, drying jerky, dark vats of simmering tar...inky intricacies all tending towards the umami. A very unusual beast. Sunflower oil past its smoke point, warm tallow, and antique desk stuffed full of pipe tobacco. Fresh grease--a whole toolbox of oily tools and rags. 

**Mouthfeel**: 

**Taste**: Darkest maple syrup, but not cloying at all--surprisingly dry. Tannic wine dregs, some gluhwein, and a little fried date or raisin. Simmering black lentil curries, freshly toasted cumin seed and burnt bay leaf--a whole curry coming together. A shipload of plump and oily black tea leaves, aromatic and freshly dried. Resins and pine oils in an old wardrobe. Remainins umami with mushroom broth and even bourguignon simmering away--the red wine rancio varying to at times nearly balsamic in tannic character. More wafts of bow resin and mushrooms--a veritable pine forest, with meat spitting above a stone-encircled fire.

**Finish**: Oversteeped black tea, soggy paper, some fresh ink--a waterlogged map. Black pepper and allspice and very meaty thickness--a thick steak au Poivre, but gamey enough to be elk or venison.

Reading my own notes here, this sounds utterly chaotic, but the many savory and dry qualities here actually made for a fascinating sip. I kept concluding I didn't especially like it, but then subtleties and nuances kept pulling me in to track them down. This was a treat to sip slowly and think through.

*Tasting No. 71: Moine (peated) 20yo ex-rum cask (2003-2023, 53.3% ABV)*

This whisky received a double maturation: first in an ex-bourbon cask for 10 years, and then transferred to a Cruzan rum cask for another 10 years. Cruzan rum is made on the island of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands and aged in Jim Beam barrels (both are owned by Beam Suntory). 

**Nose**: Musty, earthy smoke--other than smelling the night air in Bowmore village on Islay with Bowmore Distillery's peat fires’ smokes tumbling greyly up into the clouds, this is the closest in whisky to actual peat in memory. Strongly vegetal, rooty, and earthy peatsmoke--clays and kilned mud and burnt wet root over the fire. Sea-salted vellum sheets encase plump tobacco leaves as leather is rubbed down with plant tallow. 

**Mouthfeel**: Not a flaw there. I kept added water to a drop or two, but the flavors coasted and lasted beautifully here.

**Taste**: A hint of sweet, sugary funk--an antique rum--and some burnt toffee bars. Crisper vegetables come in: bell pepper, tender celery, and fresh bay leaf. Burnt paper and cracked earth rumble back, a reminder of the deeply peaty roots here. Curls of bright brass and darkest espresso in a newly fired clay cup, torched orange zest, and autumnal leaf pile fires. Herbal drops and liqueurs, subtle colognes and aromatic old fashioned soaps milled with fresh rosemary and flecks of sandalwood. 

**Finish**: Essence of a bonfire night--that beautifully strongly peat-forward smoke, lightened with the brightness of pineapple curd.  Flamed rosewood planks, black tea, and an empty pot of Lapsang Souchong dregs. Grilled cantalope lingers, and some earthy sweetness of sarsaparilla and birch. The burnt raisins atop a Christmas cake and the deep, creamy sweetless of long-roasted celery.  

**Mental image**: ""So that's it, then? That's the secret, grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow.""

**Score**: 94. This was fantastic. Rum finishes have been hit and miss with me, and this one, with 10 years of rum after a decade in clearly nice first-fill bourbon, was outstanding balance that beautifully showcased Bunnahabhain peatsmoke in a gentle, nuanced frame. Lovely.
That Canasta sounds beyond intense! The whole experience sounded amazing. I am Jack’s infinite envy… I am going to get to Islay someday…
They have a beautiful spot on that side of the island. We parked in port Charlotte and took the walking trail over.
Wow,  what a tasting! I must say your tasting notes are awesome,  very expressive , and evoking clear images of what you're tasting/ experiencing.  Cheers
Awesome tasting and I’m full of envy!

Not to be that guy, but you are correct that Beam Suntory own Cruzan but they don’t own Bunnahabhain. Beam Suntory owns Laphroaig, Bowmore, Glen Garioch, Auchentoshan, and Ardmore.

Distell owns Bunnahabhain, Tobermory/Ledaig, and Deanston.
One of the biggest bummers of my trip to Islay a decade ago is that Bunnahabhain wasn’t doing warehouse tastings back then. Knew they had some really unique stuff that we just weren’t getting a chance to taste.
Not surprised the Moine slapped. I'd love a bottle of that.
Great writeup, can't wait to go back this year!
Envy. I still have a smidge of a 20cl 13yo PX cask from 2016. Probably still among the best whiskies I ever had.

*This Allt-a-Bhainne, distilled in October 2008, was matured for 14 years in a first-fill (ex-bourbon) barrel and bottled in 2022 to coincide with the Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival 2023, or simply another good opportunity for the SMWS to slap some different label art on a release. It is bottled as one of SMWS' ""Juicy Oak & Vanilla"" flavor profile--the first I've tried in that profile.*

**Nose**: Juicy fruit sweets: pineapple and mellow lemon gums, lemon pie, and even sugar-dusted pineapple curd. Pleasant woody snap from the barrel that balances the sweets with dryness nicely. A little dust, some fruit piths and cores, and a few packs of bubble gum.

**Mouthfeel**: Very coating, nearly tacky in how well it clings to the mouth. Quite nice.

**Taste**: Freshly snipped flower stems (power of suggestion be damned), salty pebbles, barbari crust, and warm greenhouse. Aromatic essences and oils--in particular rose oil and sweet, floral candles. Sunflower oil and some less-sweet Sauternes poaching liquid after the pears have been taken out. White gluhwein spritzed with mineral water.

**Finish**: Very nice and dry--twiggy but balanced, still with some generically tropical fruit curds, a little chalk dust and pineapple core, and curtain drop on pandan leaf.

Tastings No. 65-66: Laphroaig 2023 Cairdeas (52.3% ABV) and CS Batch 16 (58.5% ABV),,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/197gre5,"*Tasting No. 65 - Laphraoig 10yo Cask Strength Batch 16 (2012/2022, 58.5% ABV)*

I acquired both of these samples at the distillery in October 2023, where the Cairdeas it is handed out as the welcome dram in nifty little green bottles. I participated in the 1.5 hour ""Experience Tour"" at the distillery one sunny day amid a string of rainstorms, at the conclusion of which you are offered included pours of a range of bottles at the distillery's inside bar. The offerings were surprisingly pedestrian, consisting of the core range plus a new 40% travel exclusive in the mix; fortunately, there were also several of the cask strength releases; I obtained pours of CS batches 14-16 that I saved for later, being on the 1100 tour and noonish being a hair too early for whisky that day. I subsequently enjoyed batches 14-15, taking no notes, whereas the final little sample jar, Batch 16, survived in my Islay sample reliquary until late December. I will admit it was unlikely to have benefitted from such a time in a half-full sample jar.

**Nose**: The salty, wind-whipped sands of Machir Bay; seaweed on the breeze, medical smoke, lanolin, and charcoal soap. Some nice mineral oil, oil-slick bicycle chain, warm electronics, and ashy candle wicks. A very woodsy cologne-forward caramel character I often associate with this distillery's non-wine finished bottlings.

**Mouthfeel**: Thin-looking in the glass--legless--and really actually quite watery int he mouth for something nearer to 60% than not. Surprising, and something I must chalk to over-airing in the sample jar.

**Taste**: Tame coastal Laphraoig smoke; oil-bloomed black pepper, smoked bandages and gauzes, and a hit of baby powder. Bitter, mossy peat. Oak and soggy, over-steeped lapsang souchong tea leaves. Really a lot of very active, ginger spice oak here, and it's a bit off-putting as it takes over. For usually being a real cracker at batch strength, this is really very tame and quiet--a washed-out echo of the normal roar. 

**Finish**: Rubber and ash--powerfully on fresh wood with none of the benefits of ex-bourbon creaminess--all IKEA. Burnt pith, tire smoke on tarmac, and damp ashy acridity. 

Sadly, not my favorite Laphraoig--or, a badly over-aired sample.

*Tasting No. 66 - Laphraoig 2023 Cairdeas (52.3% ABV)*

*Laphroaig's 2023 iteration of its series of higher-strength, usually wine-finished NAS releases known as Cairdeas was aged for an unspecified number of years in a combination of White Port and Madeira casks. I was delighted to get this as a welcome dram to take away and taste slowly, as I'd been looking forward to trying it, having never tried the Warehouse No. 1 Cairdeas and not particularly been impressed by the lack of balance of the PX Cairdeas prior.* 

**Nose**: Smoked white grapes, warm nylon, chard stems. Chardonnay-like buttery oak and a very savory sausage chord. Light char and sweet white fruit juice.

**Mouthfeel**: Looks to be a bit more viscous, with quite thick legs in the glass. A bit of a letdown in the mouth, though--it looks as though it should be thick, but never seems to really cling to the mouth. As a result, a little pallid and quiet--not much comes through without straining.

**Taste**: Lightly toasted orzo, grain dust, light smoke, and salty: rain-washed beach salinity. This really is a reticent sip! Incredibly muted gauze fire, remote peat earthiness, a puff of cold ash. Where is...anything? 

**Finish**: Finishes on moderately bitter ash, some warm candlewax, and a glimpse of barley sweetness. Even that nearly-oversweet wine on the nose never really showed up. A little rubber glove, a few drops of grape juice (there!). Not much black pepper at all, but the oakiness rears its head with ginger and white pepper. It's not great. An indistinct sweetness lingers as an overlay to the gentle smoke. Closes on sawdusty oak, charred pith, and acrid smoke.

*This Ardnamurchan, a vatting of batches distilled in 2017 and 2018, was matured for 5-6 years in a combination of ex-PX and ex-Oloroso casks before being married together, yielding 900 bottles. This was sampled at an Adelphi tasting at Petite Cellars, MD, and in a purchased bottle of the same.*

**Nose**: Salted sherry caramel, deeply roasted pumpkin flesh, acrid bonfire ash, and the punchy hit of peat sprinkled with spicy cocktail bitters. Shoe leather from the sherry, some stained new wood, and a roll of dark, glossy plum lavashak. Smoked sea salt and perfectly dark amber tahdig.

**Mouthfeel**: Lovely and velvety. It's quite peppery on the palate, with a whallop even with months of air. Takes water rather well, though that does tamp the smoke down and ratchet the ginger up. Very sweet and rather woodily drying.

**Taste**: Sherried peat - meets the mark on both, with the sherry being really rather heavy. Pleasant, just rather pitched towards the sherry, balance-wise. Salted plum lavashak hung to dry in coastal bonfires' crossbreeze. Hot ash, warm copper, lovely autumnal warmth of pumpkin caramels and some rather smoky cream. Persian black tea perfumed with cardamom, a dusting of dried bergamot peel. Ashy peatsmoke carries into the finish, following the strains of maple kindling and deeply smoked maple syrup--a whole tin mug of it.

**Finish**: Salinity lingers beyond the sweetness of the sherry by quite a long bit. Softly peppery, as a variety of small-batch root beers. A handful of ginger chews wrapped in oak lavashak, some birch gum, and fireside maple candy. The distillate does seem rather lost with all this cask shoutiness, but the West coast salinity does prevail. Oh, how I crave to see this same youthful Ardnamurchan in a 2nd fill ex-bourbon barrel...anyway, acrid maple ash wins the finish.

*This Caol Ila, distilled in March 2012, was matured for 10 years in a refill ex-bourbon barrel. It is bottled as one of SMWS' ""Peated"" profile in an outturn of 271 bottles.*

**Nose**: Salted stones wreathed in tarry smoke. Burnt rope, oily wood, charred sailcloth, and extinguished torch pitch with a few slices of deeply charred lemon. 

**Mouthfeel**:  Rather flawless. Needs no water, though the bottle being open for a couple weeks helps balance some of the initial closed-off quality. Crisp, warming, and really very faultless delivery of a very faultless spirit.

**Taste**: Clean sea breeze and chilling wisps of salty night-silvered spindrift. Crispy fried fish skin, whipping rain on sand, and that astringent, ashy Caol Ila calling card of dry coastal smoke. Some crusts of a large sourdough boule, juniper mashed into Maldon salt, warm engine oil and some dock rubber...the hot, elemental sense of a roaring furnace--hot metals. Eventually, the deep dark cocoa note I often get with this distillery, as well as squid ink, burnt roast ends, darkly roasted cruciform vegetables, and some charred pita ends. This is a fairly raw presentation of Caol Ila here, in a refill barrel at a young age, and it's executed perfectly, with no cask trickery or coverup. Rather glorious, truth be told.

**Finish**: Lingers on charred sourdough, salty air, and the smoke of night-fires drifting over unseen stones toward Ireland.

I picked this one up on a whim because SMWS sent me a coupon and that same week Caol Ila announced they weren’t going to sell casks to IBs any more. I have a few Caol Ilas to open first, so I’d been wondering if it was a mistake to pick this up but now I’m super excited to taste it! Thanks for this!
I tried this earlier this year in The Kaleidoscope Bar and wowza it was a gem.
No mistake, friend. Enjoy it. 
I’m waiting for their next outturn with a refill 53 given how nice this was, especially given the IB sales spigot shutoff. The Ruadh Mhor bottlings are lovely, but just not exactly the same niche.
Yes—the refill bourbon was a big part of why I ordered this. I’m finding more and more I just want to taste the spirit with minimal wood influence, especially with pleated Islays. Thanks!"
"Tasting No. 62 - Macallan 17yo (2005/2023, Signatory Cask Strength , 57.5% ABV)",,https://i.redd.it/h4c3sqxskq2c1.png,"*Tasting No. 62 - Macallan 17yo (2005/2023, Signatory Cask Strength , 57.5% ABV)*

*This secret Speyside ""M"" (Macallan) single malt, distilled in July 2005, was matured for 17 years in a first fill Oloroso sherry butt and bottled in April 2023. The cask it was in, the cryptically syntaxed DRU17/A106 #12, produced 660 bottles, of which mine is #579. At the time of purchase, this bottle was US $191 via The Whisky Barrel, though the price has popped up to $290 lately, evidently an algorithmic supply/demand-led spike. I see there is also an 18yo sister cask available now, as well. Given the availability of integrity bottlings of cask strength Macallan, I think this was quite reasonable (and enjoyable!) at my purchase point, but am inclined elsewhere for the current asking.* 

**Nose**:  Classical and elegant modern sherry wood profile. Some tartness--pomegranate molasses--and rosehip syrup emerges from within the sherry fug, as well as daubs of hazelnut butter on orange oil-rubbed writing desk wood. I found this bottle opened up considerably after being open a couple months. With air, the sherry deepens to burnt chocolate scone batter with cognac-plumped raisins. There's a savory quality, as well, of toasted vermicelli, leathery jerky, and smoked mushroom. Rosewood boxes and mothballs.

**Mouthfeel**: Glorious viscosity, even with a couple drops of water to open. Very drinkable at its proof, and would have me guessing closer to 48%.

**Taste**: Oh, yes, this is very good. Excellent leathery arrival, with the cask influence walking the sweet-savory line between peppered dried beef strips and puddingy Oloroso. Orange zest sprinkled into a goblet of Armagnac. Chocolate creme patisserie, woody chestnut mash, some acorns even. There is a certain meatiness to this (and, I have found, other Macallans) that is quite enhanced at higher proof--an earthy, savory note of mushroom, cream of mushroom soup, bourguignon with polenta, thyme-oil emulsion. At times, the char of smoky earth, close to smoked paprika--quite unexpected for this distillery...cold grilled meat, woody BBQ sweet-savoriness, mushrooms baked in parchment paper. It reminds me of a Highland Park cask I sampled at the Cadenheads warehouse tour quite a bit, with its meaty mesquite BBQ prominence--though that one, of course, was quite peated, comparatively. Beneath the savory char, there's cognac-brushed fresh wood--very Bowmore 15--warm walnuts, baklava and walnut oil, and smooth, creamy chocolate cremeux. 

**Finish**: Cream of mushroom soup, caramel popcorn tossed on a roasted BBQ sandwich, hazelnut praline decorating a chocolate pavlova, burnt caramel, varnished wooden dessert platter. Very lasting on chocolate-spiked brandy, cremeux, and ember.

**Score**: 89

This was annoyingly fantastic. It was leaps and bounds different from any OB Macallan I've ever had, and, even if this--perhaps an 'off-profile' cask--was a quirky remix of the classical sherry-matured Speyside single malt, made more interesting with its side-quests into unexpected flavors.
I've only had the G&M version of the CS Macallan sadly, I hope I run into a signatory offering somewhere. If not, I'll have to pick this up for a Christmas present since I'm a huge fan of sherry bombs
I can say I genuinely loved this bottle of whisky! In my top 5. 

Just a note there are difference between bottling. I have number 3 and 16. 3 is a tiny bit nicer.
Great review.  I have an old Signatory CS named Macallan from a bourbon hogshead a bit older than this.  It shows brilliantly the mouthfeel and length of finish that Macallan can produce, even in a simple bourbon cask.  

I've seen this DRU# cask naming on some unnamed Orkney malts too, but I'm not sure whether they are odd casks filled by Edrington or stocks from someone else.  Macallan and Highland Park are both filled on contract for blenders such as G&M, Douglas Laing or even Signatory themselves who might acquire it on trade.  Some of that stock does then circulate.
Great review. I was just thinking recently how interesting cask strength Macallan would be. How do we know this is Macallan?
Ps. The viscosity of this is a big differentiator. I love the thick oily taste

*This Blair Athol (a Highland distillery) single malt, distilled in March 2011, was matured for 10 years in a recharred hogshead and bottled in 2021. It falls within SMWS' ""Spicy and Sweet"" profile, and was part of a diverse bundle that also include* [this 9yo Tullibardine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/183qrjd/tasting_no_59_autumn_pursuits_tullibardine_9yo/)*, as well as three others I've yet to write up.*

**Nose**:  Dark chocolate-covered cherries, polished antiques, and torched kindling with sap bubbling up. Warm aromatics--clove and lavender being toasted in a dry pan. There's charred oak adding darker timbre, and some floral cherry drops.

**Mouthfeel**: Faultless viscosity; becomes rather hotter with time to air.

**Taste**: A very juicy firework of well-steeped fruity teas, red fruit mixed cordial, cherry syrup with walnut bitters, and sweet plum liqueur. Aha, the ""bass note"" of the SMWS naming becomes obvious here -- the cask char adds a gritty darkness of cocoa to round out the chord's root in a lovely way, and carries through to the finish. There's so much fruit here that I'm surprised the cask wasn't refill sherry (it's specified it was a hogshead, which are far, far more common in bourbon). Cast iron-roasted mixed berry jam with chocolate shavings atop, stirred by a freshly hewn oaken spoon. Chunks of blackened sourdough are scattered. atop. Blackcurrant jam, charred caramelized lemon, darkly roasted apricot, and some very welcome latte milkiness.

**Finish**: Darkened oak and pleasingly dry, bitter cocoa syrup. A little buttery oak, which becomes rather sawdusty with time. Some woody spice on the finish, which ends rather hotter. Sharpened ex-sherry wood pencil (!) and some bruleed toast dotted with marzipan.

Competent and tasty, with the dark cask char working quite well with a flavorful spirit. Not overly complex in its youth, but charming enough to make up for it.
The name of this didn't make sense to me on seeing it online.  Now it does.  I've found rechar in their case brings some pretty dark color, but less drying or sharp tannins than a virgin cask would bring.  There are certainly plenty of sherry hogsheads floating around the market, so hogshead doesn't rule that out.
Knowing SMWS, they’d tell you if it was a sherry hogshead because it gives them an opportunity to upcharge you for it.

Right, fair enough then! It didn’t make sense in my head as ex-bourbon anyway. The wood was certainly active here, but it was actually quite well balanced and didn’t have any of those IKEA or tannic virgin oak tells you mentioned. I didn’t take a picture, but this one did pick up a decent tan from the cask, though well lighter than, say, black hole Edradour levels."
"*Tasting No. 60 - Glen Scotia 25yo (1992/2017, The Whisky Agency, 49.3% ABV)",,https://i.redd.it/6k9uaqlqfl2c1.jpg,"*Tasting No. 60 - Glen Scotia 25yo (1992/2017, The Whisky Agency, 49.3% ABV)*

I found an [original distillery bottling of 25yo Glen Scotia](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/11fhr92/tasting_no_25_glen_scotia_25yo_ob_46/) to be something quite special (90), and purchased this sample to recapture the magic. This 25 year old single malt from the Glen Scotia distillery in Campbeltown, bottled by The Whisky Agency independent bottlers in collaboration with The Whisky Exchange, was distilled in 1992, matured in a single presumably ex-bourbon hogshead, and bottled in 2017, in my case a sample of one of the 273 bottles produced. Non-chillfiltered, naturally coloured and bottled at a cask strength of 49.3%.

**Nose**: Initially, hugely rum-like, very similar indeed to a 12yo Foursquare I have but lest ester-y. A rum-soaked curtain parts, revealing the patchwork-clad troupe show of Glen Scotia funk. Very light; time-weathered and sleepy. Light plastics, apple cider vinegar, rum cream and rum baba with a few drops of wood varnish. Apple butter with fennel, leek, and cardamon in. Quite unusual. Potpourri candle and lurid scented soaps with dried florals. Rained-on hay and damp shingle.

**Mouthfeel**: Liquid silk on the tongue. Quite faultless: drinking moonbeams...an atom or two thin, to be critical, but utterly heatless.

**Taste**: A little underripe blackberry bitterness. A warm compote of overripe raspberries is stirred through crepe batter by a salty wooden spoon. A pot of lime curd is nearby, with a cloud of nutmeg in the air. Mouthwatering, citron-dusted jelly candies in a dank basement. Distantly, a handful raisins with a single barberry among them. The rum returns, this time in a cocktail stirred with blueberry compote. Raspberry-lime jam, in a musty orchard picking basket...stored in the cellars.

**Finish**: Tart, with barberry eau de vie. With more time, the berry increases, with the dank shades of basement anchoring the experience. Medium in length, and mostly on sharp but decaying fruit.

**Mental image/faux SMWS name**: Cold comfort farm woodshed

**Score**: 86

Delightful, but simpler, more divergent, and less cohesive than the OB I'd tried.
Great review.  I tried this very same sample about 6 months ago, from the whisky exchange. I found a lot of the notes you had here as well.  One thing I really enjoyed was the distinct scent of kerosene on the nose for me.  It reminded me of an old kerosene heater my dad kept in the basement,  and memories of him. I really enjoyed this whisky,  and wanted a bottle but it's quite pricy.
My tasting evaluation system aims to evaluate whiskies sampled relative to my personal enjoyment, which skews towards moderately peated and nuanced whiskies with long finishes and lighter, intriguing subtleties emerging from within smoke.I categorize each whisky relative to others that I have enjoyed approximately that much within designated scoring bands. What I am looking for as I taste is:

* Balance (cask/distillate, peat/distillate, cask/peat, flavors...)
* Complexity
* Pleasingness (flavor, lack of off-notes, finish, mouthfeel & texture, general enjoyability)
* Integration (alcohol, peat, cask)

*This Tullibardine, distilled in May 2012, was matured for 9 years in a first-fill ex-bourbon barrel and bottled in <maths> 2021. It is bottled as one of SMWS' ""Spicy and Dry"" profile, which handily won me over to the profile with this exemplar.*

**Nose**: Warm, chalky plaster and leaf dust are caught in sunbeams. We have carved a bowl of new, fragrant sandalwood, and in it mix sunflower oil and plump Madagascar vanilla beans--still damp and oily--into a dusky emulsion. Granary dust and wholemeal rolls are baked on wax paper, and, nearby, warm pressed chestnut paste sits beside a browned butter cake batter as the oven clicks hotter. Butterscotch is daubed on antique butcher block nearby, topped with toasted nuts. 

**Mouthfeel**: A tinge hot--over 60%, after all--but the heat presents as a heady, spicy and woody ginger. The mouthfeel is lovely. It's very perfect with a couple drops of water.

**Taste**: Dryly twiggy, in a lovely and unmistakably autumnal way. Oiled wood, but not fresh and sawdusty--rather, of well-made furniture gleaming with top-shelf polishes and waxes. Pepper and ginger add a delightful crispness, with dried sultanas humming beneath. Butterscotch wells up, served on carved wooden trenchers, and leaf-pile dustiness and sackcloth herald a late bloom of indistinct juiciness--darkly roasted apricots in shimmering sauce, sugars caramelizing on the edges.

**Finish**: Restrained and pleasant--butterscotch and tame apricot preserves, with an unsweet thick cream ribboned through: an October trifle of sorts, balanced by the dry rasp of hot sand, new paper, moderate woodiness, and drying ink.

*This peated Glenturret, distilled in March 2009, was matured for 10 years in a second-fill ex-bourbon hogshead (Cask #57, it is specified, whatever series that may allude to), and was bottled in 2019.*

**Nose**: Kilned bricks, clay, and hot, loamy earth. Craft paste, farmy peat, stone dust, and freshly milled corn meal. A metallic edge of farm machinery and greased cogs. More peat-driven than smoke-driven. With some time to air, it turns into a farmhand grill-up with fresh corn tamales on the fire, corn-husk wrappers smoking into the night breeze.

**Mouthfeel**: Gorgeous--very coating and thick, not terribly hot. Doesn't require water, especially, but a few drops tame the heat.

**Taste**: Toasted walnuts and warm plastic over a shoulder of cumin-rubbed pork. Coal fires heating river stones, sizzling with the crackling pork fat. Salty. The farmhands finish their picnic with a few handmade soft, chewy caramels in waxed paper. The farminess is very Ardnamurchan and exceedingly pleasant.

**Finish**: Lots of powdered ginger, some Urfa biber, pencil shavings (tame woody dryness) and some smoking hay on a dying fire. The smudges of receding smoke as our retiring farmhands now puff on their cob pipes and putter off on various farm machines, back to the quiet fields. Late juiciness--pineapple gums resting in the old coals.

Great review, sounds fantastic! Peated Glenturret can be really amazing, SMWS do a fair few of them at the moment, I love the farmy element which is quite common with it.
Sounds like a great bottle!

"Tastings No. 53-57 (Springbank Bottle to Barley, October 2023)",,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17ur3d7,"The below represent the tastings I enjoyed on the Springbank Distillery Barley to Bottle tour in late October 2023, overall an exquisite experience--and one I only slightly wish I had been able to take more thorough notes on. The following are drawn from my increasingly wobbly hand-written notes and very fond recollection--and I included a few of the shots I took during the tour of Springbank and sister distillery Kilkerran, which, unlike Springbank, was in active production at the time.

Having truly appreciated Springbank's flagship OB [10 year old](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/ydity7/tasting_no_17_springbank_10_year_ob_46/), standard peated [Longrow NAS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/xuzgi1/tasting_no_14_longrow_peated_nas_46_abv/) offering, and what Kilkerran brings to the table with its core [12 year old](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14bxef0/tasting_no_36_kilkerran_ob_12yo_46/), the opportunity to sample from the casks at the distilleries was nothing short of incredible.

*Tasting No. 53 - Hazelburn 24yo 1999-2023 (47.4%, distillery exclusive)* The Barley to Bottle tour begins in the cozy Washback bar on a chill nearly November day with a starter dram--it was 10:30 in the morning--a glorious Hazelburn in first-fill sherry, distilled in 1999 and matured in Warehouse 3 for 24 years.

**Nose**: A phantasmagoria of beeswax-polished antiques, memory books stuffed with pressed leaves, dusty Victorian caramel shop, and ancient candles. Tame tobacco, old sherry...mild and perfect sweetness. Exquisite.

**Mouthfeel**: A very round, silky mouthfeel, full of flavor, thick and flawless even at sub-50%.

**Taste**: Sultana-studded fruitcake with loads of walnuts; newly refinished mariner's chest with old leather but new wax...walnut oil, a jar of chestnut cream, and warm crepes with creme caramel. Tobacco liqueur, a tiny spoonful of Amaro perhaps, and dust on old pages--crumbled vellum with raisins atop. A whisper of crackly pastry--ancienne pain aux raisins--and the beexwaxy antiques re-emerge, with a touch of dignified old pipe tobacco and the vaguely savory hint of a perfect mushroom broth after a rainstorm.

**Finish**: Forever on leaf dust, fruitcake, and polished hardwood furniture with a story.

**Score**: 92

*Tasting No. 55 - Springbank 32yo, 1990/2023 (41.6%, Bottle to Barley exclusive)*
**Nose**: A tamed, time-softened classic Springbank 10 profile, with the coalsmoke having slunk into the shadowed distance. All the same pineapple curd and basement must and oily workshop metal, but with the complexity and subtlety that more than three decades' contemplation gives. Springbank that has achieved enlightenment. 

**Mouthfeel**: Hard to explain the flawlessness of this. Not being precisely thick, exactly, it in no way suffered from being 41.5%. Flowingly silky.

**Taste**: Thoroughly true to the notes on the nose: crumbling damp ruin, with walls cracking and ancient paper mouldering inside. Guava handcream, tin and copper scraps, and ointments and tinctures stirred with old silver. Utterly smokeless, but the smoke seems to have merely disappeared into the walls and its absence itself become a presence: a ghost not truly gone. Pineapple wax stickers, indistinct herbal team, scratched vellum, lanolin and old furs in a forgotten wardrobe. Puddles and tools and old and ingots in an darkened mine.
**Finish**: Long, on subtle pineapple curd, a little passionfruit, dunnage and packed earth, and general farmy decay.

**Score**: 96
*Tasting No. 54 - Springbank newmake, October 2023 (63.5%, Barley to Bottle exclusive)*

**Nose**: Gummy fruit sweets and new unfinished butcher block; harsher grain fumes--nearly woodlike--and curious bitter tones of tonic, pith, and bark. Lots of candies--mostly tropical fruit, all quite sweet and slightly artificial. Pineapple core, even.

**Mouthfeel**: At above 60%, this was surprisingly drinkable texturally--but, being not particularly a draw taste-wise, not something I was keen to quaff a lot of.

**Taste**: Stunningly and immediately freekeh (smoked green wheat), nearly exactly: youthful grain, a silo fire's smoke, crunchy fresh barley, raw plant elementals, and, strangely (given lack of any aging), wood. Lime pith, seedy bitterness, a handful of dried sultanas, and extinguished log fires.

**Finish**: An eternity of more freekeh: smoked grain, with a lot of gummy fruit candies.

**Score**: Officially unscored, but it'd probably be something like 55. I've honestly had worse whisky that's been matured for years, so while the off-notes and balance and temperament here were all out of alignment relative to a finished spirit, it was a fun ride and such an insight into the Springbank distillate character. In many ways harsh and stark--all sharp angles, with no softness or compromise--it showed all the facets of what Springbank is, and showcased too what even just 10 years in a cask will do.

*Tasting No. 56 - Longrow 28yo, 1994/2023 (46.5%, Bottle to Barley exclusive)*

**Nose**: The smoke I expected to find a wisp of in this Longrow cask, after nearly three decades, was nonexistent. In many ways, the Longrow--aged in an ex-bourbon barrel for its life--was more of an enigma than the Springbank it followed. 

**Mouthfeel**: Soft and delicate, but firm. Demanded time and some heat from hands to begin to grasp.

**Taste**: Plush and elusive. Soft wool, lanolin, and dark used tobacco. Deeply scarred wood, forgotten coal chute, and pencil lead. The handcream note I tend to get was very noticeable--as much as the Springbank. Guava and ancient wax seals, old damp postbox and rusted metal.

**Finish**: Posh thick lanolin and handcream, guava candles, and a slightly bacon-y savoriness. 


**Score**: 95

*Tasting No. 57 - triple-distilled Kilkerran 17yo, 2006/2023 (??.?%, Bottle to Barley exclusive)*
Our experience included a last dram of an unusually triple-distilled Kilkerran from a cask (hence no assessed ABV; the Springbank and Longrow had all been decanted into bottles recently due to being low liquid levels in the casks). This was the final dram of our pass through the warehouse with Springbank's head distillery. Consequently, my notes, for Reasons, are sparser. 
**Nose**: Hugely sweet, of bubble gum and candy floss and banana cream pie. Banana extract as well. Fresh barley and indistinct cereals, rising soda bread and a slightly charred bitterness.
**Mouthfeel**: No notes.
**Taste**: Interestingly, really no smoke. Fresh cereal mash and a wagon of fruits, mostly artificial and candied. Bowls of sweet fruit drops and slices. Darker penuche frosting, toasty wholemeal bread, and some charred grain chaff. 
**Finish**: Orange savarin, other boozy cakes, more boiled sweets. Tallow candles with a pinch of wick ash and a vague brothiness close out this otherwise quite sweet dram.
**Score**: 86

I just booked the tour as part of my honeymoon next summer. Cannot wait!
Kudos for the detailed notes, I did the tour in May and I would not have had the mindfulness to take notes, so much was there to see and feel
Wonderful notes, thank you so much for sharing. I tried taking notes down during my tour but there were so many things happening I couldn’t quite jot everything down. All the drama were amazing but for me the Longrow was just…sublime. Probably the best whisky I’ll never have ever again. 

Fwiw the Kilkerran was 61.1% after 17 years! I believe the filling strength was ~69%.
My tasting evaluation system aims to evaluate whiskies sampled relative to my personal enjoyment, which skews towards moderately peated and nuanced whiskies with long finishes and lighter, intriguing subtleties emerging from within smoke.I categorize each whisky relative to others that I have enjoyed approximately that much within designated scoring bands. What I am looking for as I taste is:

* Balance (cask/distillate, peat/distillate, cask/peat, flavors...)
* Complexity
* Pleasingness (flavor, lack of off-notes, finish, mouthfeel & texture, general enjoyability)
* Integration (alcohol, peat, cask)

"Tasting No. 52 - SMWS ""Enchanted Pitch Pine and Burning Heather""",,https://i.redd.it/59cmetq6ryzb1.jpg,"*Tasting No. 52 - ""Enchanted Pitch Pine and Blooming Heather"" (Highland Park, 13yo, SMWS, 61.3% ABV)*

This SMWS bottling of a 13 year old Highland Park, cask no. 4.322, comes in the ""Peated"" flavor profile. Distilled in January 2008 and double-matured in first ex-bourbon hogsheads before being transferred to a first fill ex-bourbon barrel, this was sampled from a freshly opened bottle in the Glasgow SMWS members room on Bath Street.

**Nose**: Quite a brutalist Highland Park--ashy heather, deeply charred tahdig, freshly flamed green twigs, and cold honey sweets.

**Mouthfeel**: Quite punchy, even with water. Water tames the spicy heat, but this is overall a quite hot dram.

**Taste**: The raw, stark Highland Park profile from the nose continues on the palate: Salted lemon slices, low-sugar ginger-honey cough drops, and woodsmoked tent canvas. Coalsmoke pours over the trees where more twig-fires burn. The peat here is more coastal--medicinal, even, atypical for this distillery--and a very driving character. On the whole, very dry and savory, of woods fresh and charred twigs, burning hay and some iron, and a few damp florals--dried lavender. Really very sparse--globally dry and quite unsweet.

**Finish**: Punchy peatsmoke, ginger-infused honey, and green twigs. Closes out on more youthful split logs, with a last wheeze of coalsmoke over the moors.

**Mental image/faux SMWS name**: Hogwarts Express Derailment

Burning 🔥or blooming 🌸?
I've really been enjoying the Distillery 4 releases from SMWS lately. It's in that sweet 12-14 year range which really makes it shine. There's something about highland park in ex-bourbon that I wish they did more of. Not sure if it needs to be in sherry like the OBs

Sigh. Yes, blooming. Power of association…I noticed and fixed it in the comment itself, too late for the post title.
Very much agreed. I think it shines in ex bourbon. I hope SMWS does more “distillery dives“ and contrasts more of this distillery across different maturation profiles. It’s interesting enough that it doesn’t need sherry to backfill for personality.
Fair enough! I initially thought it was subtle commentary on the flavor. 😂"
"Tasting No. 51 - Laphraoig Quarter Cask (48%, OB, circa 2022)",,https://i.redd.it/tog9dnhbi3mb1.jpg,"I dearly love the Quarter Cask. It's the wood that get me. Sweet peated wood. None of that flowery citrus nonsense we find in a lot of ex-bourbon, just real oak flavor. For a 6 year-old, this is splendid. I prefer it over the 10 at this very moment but that might change.
*Tasting No. 51 - Laphraoig Quarter Cask (48%, OB, circa 2022)*

**Nose**: Laphraoig's signature character, thickly of salty coastal stone, an ocean of shadowy iodine, and leathery, stiff caramel. Quite a bit more young leather here--jerky, almost--than in the 10yo...cream, too; some sort of set pudding, left to finish by the side of a beachwood fire. Some rubber grit and fresh-cracked pepper, and a ramekin of cedarwood broth. A few tins of herbal rubs and ointments, too.

**Mouthfeel**: It's not exactly thick as expected at 48%; the 43% 10yo to my recollection was a bit nicer (and also probably older)...silky on the tongue, but not stunning by any stretch.

**Taste**: True to the nose through and through, but heavy, heavy on warm wood spice and low on smoke. The briny iodine distillate character is actually very quiet here. I miss its punch, frankly...this is blander and woodier and somehow less smoky than the 10yo. A generous handful of rubber bands, some burnt straw, and an ancient farm salt lick...becomes woodier with time in the glass; I dare not reduce here for fear of what oaky attack would ensue. Dull, hot woody spices, less smoke, and blander as time goes on.

**Finish**: An echo of iodine-soaked gauze fire, but really just a fresh wood cocktail..plank juice. It's not a long finish, however.

**Glass note**: Yes, that's not a glencairn. I took this bottle with me for a week in a lake cabin. Nosing in the mug was a little harder, but fortunately this dram was anything but shy.

**Nose**: Brine, capers, and crushed seashells open this coastal smoke manifesto. Lime--both dried and fresh--pineapple and salted tropical fruits accompany burning driftwood. The smoke is light and pleasantly bitter, ashy Caol Ila smoke. It carries with it hints of darkest chocolate and tobacco.

**Mouthfeel**: At 57.1%, very thick; no complaints.

**Taste**: Licorice root and a ginger chew or two. Lovely metallics and a single caper's worth of brine. Coastal, but not offensively salty. Light charry lemon notes, and pleasingly creamy -- some kind of Islay panna cotta...good refill cask here. Bitterest chocolate and tobacco leaf--the notes I get from Caol Ila peat typically. Some latent lime--limeade and curd--a dusting of pepper, and a salty squirt of squid ink. Really not very oaky (a relief)--I'm pleased how well the youth and cask balance here. 

**Finish**: Fairly long, on ash, dark chocolate, creme caramel, coastal rocks, and salted citrus on the grill.

This is a great everyday sipping Islay. I finished one bottle of this; have my eye peeled for a second.
My bottle reminds me of some Machrie Moor Cask Strengths I've had.  Not too dissimilar from that one Ardbeg that was finished in rum casks either (can't think of the name).  I think the citrus peel-like presence is a bit too prominent for my liking and prefer the 10-year over this currently, but I haven't put them head-to-head just yet.  

Football (American) starts in about 20 minutes so maybe today is the perfect day to do so!
This is Caol Ila matured in 4th fill bourbon casks.
Total Wine introduced Scarabus to me at one of their classes.
I was not disappointed with it and have picked up a few offerings since.
Good stuff at a good price.
Coincidentally, I picked up a bottle at my local store this morning. The proprietor recommended it and told me it was either Caol Ila or Lagavulin and he himself leaned more towards Lagavulin. I've only took off the cork for a quick sniff and to me it smelled like a (young) Cadenheads Caol Ila I finished last year: it's zesty and ashy.

Great review, thanks! I have been eyeing this since I tend to like NAS high strength unknown Islay. This might just be the next und the list.
Did you add any water to this at any point in the tasting? Most CS whiskies reveal much more flavour with a bit of water added.
How do you know for certain?
It is very clearly Caol Ila IMO. I was pretty irritated when I first tried this - it smashed me over the head with the acrid bitterness. I didn’t like it at all - totally disjointed. I let it chill for a few weeks and it came back together. Much improved. It’s probably the most affordable CS Islay option I have in the PNW.
I gotta ask, since I see where you rate Benro10...Have you tried the Benro15?  


I agree with your 85 rating.  The thing is, their standard entry expression, the Scarabus NAS, is, in my estimation, a variant flavor profile and a better value (@ $34 US/750 ml).  I also have their 10 and have only had a neckpour dram off of it, but it surprised me by having more of a Longrow profile than the expected Caol Ila profile.
I did; it took water quite well, enhancing some of the citrus and acrid ash for me.
Whisky expert from local bar told it, he said it is meant to be distillate forward expression.
I have yet to try the 15, but I do have their 11 year old cask strength yet unopened. Looking forward to that one. 
Interesting that the standard NAS has a variant flavor profile. I’ll have to give that a shot at some point… I’m quite impressed with Hunter Liang’s bottlings in quality and value in general. I’ve not seen the ten-year around, but, depending on where it’s priced, it may start to be rivaled by other similar Caol Ila bottlings.
I, too, have 2011 cask strength Benro, as yet unopened.

I, too, am impressed with every Hunter Laing I've opened.
Here, in the PNW,  the 10 is priced higher than the Batch Strength.  It's not quite the value of the original expression, but the Longrow similarity made it a pleasant surprise."

**Nose**: Warmed honey stirred through with a moderate and dignified sherry streak. Tea-steeped sultana, warm date loaf, walnut cake--oozes top-quality hygge bakes. Deeply rich & desserty. Some boozy chocolate cake with a pinch of cinnamon. Light grapeskin. Confident and competent, with stellar balance.

**Mouthfeel**: Lovely thick mouthfeel - like syrup. Devilishly smooth, and very drinkable without water.

**Taste**: Very faithful to the nose--like syrup to the taste, too. The vague hint of grapeskin and puff of rancio keeps the desserty tones from being too overbearing. This is quite close to the [Glengoyne CS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/xnro90/tasting_no_10_glengoyne_cask_strength_batch_8_592/), I think. Malt loaf with butter, toffee pudding, and brain raisin muffins. Really splendidly balanced -- not a brash bomb like I found the [Abunadh](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/udgy0s/tasting_no_5_aberlour_abunadh_batch_71/) to be.

**Finish**: Paper sherry, and a little too much plain wood here for me. Wood sugars, sap, planks...the finish is losing it all the points won above. Otherwise, it was brilliant in balance. Finishes on honey-drizzled apfelkuchen with a single barberry in--drying, on woods and saps. Rather too unabashedly IKEA warehouse for me.

Thanks for the review (great photo too) ! For clarity, at 55.1% ABV it has to be the 12 yo CS 2021 edition. The 2022 edition is at 56.6% and seems to be even better according to about everyone who tasted both (unfortunately not my case).
I actually wasn’t that big a fan of the 2021 version. Haven’t had the 2022 version yet. The 2021 lacked a flavor punch to me, I thought the standard 12 year had a better mouthfeel in comparison."
"Bruichladdich 8yo Islay Barley (50%, OB, 2013)",,https://i.redd.it/4xnzitkpotlb1.jpg,"*Tasting No. 48: Bruichladdich 8yo Islay Barley (50%, OB, 2013)*

**Nose**: Grain dust and sweet, farmy mash. Chalky fruit pastilles with a remote tartness. Juicy oak, fresh plank. Simple, but inoffensive. Quite a bare whisky, really exposes the barley with no cask illusionism. 

**Mouthfeel**: A little hot right away, but no complaints with the 50% - drinks well and doesn't lack.

**Taste**: Freshly opened  green banana--quite drying. Some kind of oaky amaro or wood aperitif with firm pear, vanillin, and core of pineapple. A bit of water (5ml) brings out dry Brut notes. The water tames that initial pop of heat nicely without diminishing flavor, but I wouldn't add more than the 5ml to my \~25ml glass. 

The wood balance is off for me--it remains very spicy of woody ginger, hot stems, and white pepper--which might also be the youth. Young Bruichladdich always drinks quite hot to me, but takes water very well. It's an honest, pleasant whisky, with no gimmicky cask facades, and executes its barley-forward mission well--but it's not jaw-dropping otherwise; I think it shows my bias towards unpeated Bruichladdich with more potent wine finishes.

**Finish**: Finishes off with a handful of hay, light airy Benrinnes-like apple, bitter pith, and some green branch. Overall, a very arboreal finish--a crunchy, fresh summer salad. Underripe pear tart, frangipane, and brutally under-buttered shortcrust. Slight dusty funk eventually, the kind of must I associate with Springbank, but much more weakly. White grape juice, fresh wood, and fresh barley.

Tasting No. 47: Port Charlotte Islay Barley 8yo - 50%,,https://i.redd.it/o0in7kyu6fcb1.jpg,"*Tasting No. 47: Port Charlotte Islay Barley - 50%*

**Nose**: Dusty hay, field-fire; darkens to hot smoking metals and deepest char - an ancient cast iron in the fires of Mordor, with Pellenor burning. Vibrantly farmy with time in the glass: clean manure, fresh barley and grainy sugars, a bit of anise, plenty of toasty nuts with overtones of burnt notes growling below. A remote hint of fire-roasted fruit that I eventually determine is torched plum, skin on.

**Mouthfeel**: No complaints with the 50% - drinks well and doesn't lack.

**Taste**:  Farmier indeed than the regular PC offering. The char is more prominent here than on the nose, and deeply seared meat crackling-hot on a spit features. Some surprise fruits, however: berry friands and a few pleasant pops of barberry that go off like tiny tart crimson fireworks every few sips. Certainly some old-fashioned coalsmoke, burnt chocolate cake crusts, and brake dust hot on the air. Chocolate lava cakes too, some rusty metal (a single stick of rebar) and earthiness rather like turmeric. The earthiness lowers down to proper earth--lively real farm earth, redolent of high summer heat, with cinders flecked throughout. The sweetness remains mostly dark, though still with those recurring sparks of barberry like fruity sparks on the fire. Really quite excellent.

**Finish**: Darker than leather or tobacco, but with balanced sweetness--more molten chocolate cakes, extra dark, cooked on the searing hot grill that still smokes nearby.

It does not. This is the old NAS Islay Barley that came in the white tin, before the rebrand adding vintages in 2018. Not sure where OP got the 8 year old from.
Looks like I was partially making stuff up…the inked-on bottling code has a date from November 2016. I had been looking at abBruichladdich Islay Barley on my shelf, which *does* have a distillation date of 2008, right around when I took my notes for this one. I evidently mashed the two together when writing.
No worries. I had thought you put that because the 2013 vintage was 8 years old. Eight probably is a good guess for this one, though there’s a good chance it’s less because the Classic Laddie contains some whiskies that are less than 8, and the first vintage Islay Barley after the rebrand was 6 (the oldest was the 2013 vintage at 8)."
Tasting No. 46: Bruichladdich 11yo Micro-Provenance Series single cask (Pauillac) - 62.4%,,https://i.redd.it/d04iwjow3dcb1.jpg,"***Tasting No. 46: Bruichladdich 10yo Micro-Provenance Series single cask (Pauillac) - 62.4%***

*Since reading* A Gentleman in Moscow, *whose protagonist favored a certain Sauternes (Château d'Yquem), that vinicole rather stuck in my mind. Years later, I saw Bruichladdich’s Micro-Provenance single cask series (which uses quirky and fun wine casks to mature or finish its unpeated line and bottles at cask strength) used Château d'Yquem casks! Sauternes, unfortunately, is not my preferred wine profile (or whisky finish profile probably), so I made little effort to find that precise bottling in spite of the connection. The Micro-Provenance Series, however, rather stuck with me. By good fortune, I happened to find a decently priced bottle of the series with a second fill Pauillac wine cask maturation.*

*Pauillac is a red wine produced within the Bordeaux region–a production commune in Haut-Médoc specifically. As with all Bordeaux, it contains mostly Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, but is often mixed with other varietals; its profile is plummy and delicious, and I am fascinated to see how it marries with Bruichladdich’s rather effortlessly perfect spirit. At a youthful 10 years’ maturation, this ought not be particularly complex, but I am hoping for a noticeable leg up on, say, the Classic Laddie.*

**Nose**: Huge airstrike of red berry medley: strawberries, redcurrants, and raspberries. Raspberry bushes in summer heat. Tart red berry confiture, some interestingly rum-like wafts of maplewood, Bordeaux minerality and dryness - mouthwatering even before sipping. Does seem quite…proofy, though. More of the summer-warmed berries, stingingly tart. Powdery fruit candies, fruit yoghurt, and fresh limeskin.

**Mouthfeel**: Woof–hot. Incredibly, blindingly, singeingly hot. Its heat is rivaled, to memory, only by possibly the Highland Park CS, which I believe came in at about the same ABV. The heat blast tapers off, especially with (lots) of water. The mouthfeel, however, is quite flawless.

**Taste**: Lovely fruits, tight and sharp, and a lightsaber-precise blade of red wine keeping them from jammy sappiness. Lactic and citric acids to be sure, some like the sugars left over in a sweet and sours bag. Berry macarons, a whole pile of them, and some Swiss meringue with fresh berries crushed in. Some very lean, summery desserts–cream, compots and confitures, gelée. Tartest grapeskin mash…all very mouthwatering from tartness. It is quite sharp, but very to my liking…saltless and citric, very far removed indeed from the caramels and butterscotches. Certainly young-tasting, and not huge on complex layers, but I do love what’s presented. It’s so different and lovely–it’s the Anti-Sherry Bomb: lively, sharp, vivid, tingling. Loads of astringent, chalky red fruit candies. With water, the furnace blast of alcohol burn diminishes and lets the fruits speak better (though still very biting)--white pepper macarons, clove-led spice blend…remains brightly fruity-- lemon zest atop strawberry boiled sweets.

What a cracker. Brash and young, but wickedly itself. Terribly fun and unique.

**Finish**: Raspberry liqueur, wine astringency, citric redcurrant candies with a little lavender. Long finish. Quite nice.

**Mental image/faux SMWS name**: The Parable of the Vintner and the Barley-witch

**Score**: 87
Yeah at 10yr and 62%, I can imagine it had some heat. I think it’s interesting they release these so the consumer can try some casks like a master distiller/blender. However I have found over 60% needs water in most cases. I should think the flavor profile suggests it would make a great blood and sand or old fashioned. Nothing wrong in enjoying a few cocktails out of the bottle, especially if you are adding water anyway to enjoy it.

This expression is apparently finished in Champagne Chardonnay casks–a fact I did not know upon tasting, but was fascinated to discover after, with a mouthful still left–because–who knew–Paul Launois is the name of a wine producer in Champagne.

**Nose**: Chalk, more on chalky crunchy candies and musty sweet wines. Artificial fruits and essences and fruit-bottom yoghurt. Stone dust, faintly, and granary loft; banana essence. Quite calm and notably creamy. Faintest waft of dunnage. Some acetone bite on the nose, even with time to rest.

**Taste**: Instant zing of mineral, dry tartness amid a huge cloud of banana candy. Very faint peat perhaps, emerging mostly in vegetal form–long-roasted cruciferous vegetables, pensive and dark from the heat. A lot of wood–and indeed is quite bourbon-like, in fact, just less on the raw fresh wood. The dunnage, cellar-y must increases with time, but still quite a minor player overall–certainly much more on fruit and sweets, tropical for both. Overwhelmingly and eternally of banana–banana essence, banana creme patisserie, cheap coin-operated grocery store machines that dispense a handful of brightly colored, banana-shaped candies. In my notes, I attributed the banana notes to very active ex-bourbon casks (perhaps some uncommon supplier), but I see now it must have been the finish (making me rather want to try this Champagne to see if it matches the profile). Wood on the ascent over the course of the dram.

**Mouthfeel**: Certainly pops of heat, and the heat increases with time. Thinner than the proof would have suggested, actually.

**Finish**: Quite spicy–nearly American rye–and heavily of fennel seed and anise. The banana remains prominent, as does the buttery-sweet wood.

**Nose**: Pate choux (still baking), strawberry confiture, and pomegranate syrup. Tart Montmorency cherries and some crunchy-topped baked oatmeal. Certainly sherry wafting up with the noticeably high proof. Fruit-filled chocolates, creme patisserie, an oversweet raspberry cordial, and darkly roasted strawberries baked down into delectable goo.

**Taste**: It’s the top-tier dessert cart: chocolate cheesecake with a red berry coulis; Cognac sauce, thick cream with vanilla, and beautiful panna cotta. Fairly chocolate-centered in terms of its dessert profile–not bad. Very like the [Glengoyne CS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/xnro90/tasting_no_10_glengoyne_cask_strength_batch_8_592/), really. A spritz of Triple Sec, some candied peel that dries off to some Seville marmalade. More citrus--that becoming quite prominent all around, actually–and lightens away from the creamy desserts somewhat. Quite fine, really; I like it more than the [Aberlour A’bunadh](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/udgy0s/tasting_no_5_aberlour_abunadh_batch_71/) but perhaps a hair less than the Glengoyne Batch 8. It’s not hugely complex, which I had hoped for, even at 15 years.

**Mouthfeel**: Bit of heat right away, and not overwhelmingly luxurious in the mouth. But flavor punches right through, no qualms there. Is rather eye-prickling at times.

**Finish**: Quite dry, on cherry juice, citrus pith, coffee grounds, old wood, and cocoa powder.

**Nose**: Rivulets of slow tar, brine-encrusted stones. Sweet red licorice and toasted fennel seed, perhaps with mahleb. Wet canvas, rope, and billows and billows of seaside smoke. It’s a much more working class Talisker–a bit more brash, more suntanned, less–in a good way–polished. Light aspects come through on the nose, all of them utterly and starkly un-sherried. It’s austere and rocky.

**Taste**: A long-overfull ashtray of acrid, ashy smoke–a vinegary sort of acridity to it that’s not exactly like saltwater. Very darkest chocolate, tarred ropes, beach pebbles, and burning twigs. A decent balance, but it doesn’t astound with the complexity. Very, very little on the fruity side–perhaps underripe peach, green almonds, and the metallic tang of salted metal: a beachside railway. It’s one of those lovely scenic drams, where the sense of place really overtakes: you get salty lashings of wind, howls of storm winds blowing out a driftwood beach-bivouac’s fire. There’s oceanic bluster, raw rock, and the solemn austerity of land, sea, and air.

**Mouthfeel**: On the lighter side; about average.

**Finish**: Ever so much salt, tarry smokes, ash, and herbed lozenges.

I really enjoy this whisky, I can definitely confirm the parallels to Talisker. I think it's surprisingly close to Talisker Skye which I also like very much. Interested to see the future of this distillery.

Tasting No. 41: Ledaig 10yo OB - 46.3%,,https://i.redd.it/bajd7kexgz6b1.png,"Great review. Ledaig 10 is one of the best value for money easy sipping peated whiskies out there, and a great intro to Ledaig. Really excited to try the 18, the Rioja cask finish is great too. Got a couple samples of some others that I’m really excited to try.
*Tasting No. 41: Ledaig 10yo OB - 46.3% ABV*

**Nose**: Salted rubber smoke, engine exhaust, and an undertone of sweet woodsmoke. Charred cherrywood in a stone oven roasting an apple tart. Nose sweetens with time, and lovely cellar must emerges. Toasted seeds–sesame and sunflower–with some coils of brass.

**Taste**: Plenty of meaty char and maritime industry smoke. Has a vinegar-like eye-opening acridity that nears to lemon or pine cleanser. Pine tar, smoked salt–many aspects of core Talisker, but a more perfect level of smoke. The vinegar/cleanser astringency carries the deeper tarriness. Some burnt matches, black and Urfa pepper, unsweet brulee topping. Deeply charred sourdough boule crust, and burnt tarka. The dockside industrial notes are present, but I don’t get a terrible lot of funk. Crisp wood sugars, hay, and baked shortcrust…smoke-dried green wheat berries (freekeh). The smoke itself is quite delicious and unique. It’s not hugely complex, but very crispy and roundly competent. Maybe a few more years of age would tip into quite extraordinary.

**Mouthfeel**: Medium thickness, a hair prickly.

**Finish**: Lightweight finish, despite the deeper chat aspects. It does make me want to try sherried Ledaig. Slightly woodsy, and finishes with salt and rubber-mixed sand.

**Score**: 86
Ledaig 10 is good but Ledaig 18 blows it, and most other whiskies, out the water.
Great review! This is my go to drink to pair with the charcoal grill. The second I light the charcoal chimney I pour some ledaig 10
Very good review 

This is one of my favourite affordable bottles around. This bunnahabhain 12 and Deanston 12 are brilliant value for money
Bought one during the Distell free shipping promo and wish I had bought a few more. I prefer the savory elements of Ledaig over many other peated whiskies. 

Love the photo!
Great review and photo!

This is one of my favorite bottles
This bottle was a 5 maybe a 6 for me the day I opened it, and after 2 or 3 months just sitting on the shelf it was a solid 7.5.

I've heard a lot of folks who share this sentiment.  They are both priced crazy low as well. For the price I can't think of many whiskies (peated, at least) that beat the 10 year old.  I've yet to try the 18, but I hear praise about it all the time.  I see it on sale on the whisky world for 80 bucks , and the 10 for like 37.99. Great stuff.
What do you like in particular about the 18?
Sooooo good!  The 19 is phenomenal too.
Where do you live?
Well that's nice. I can't find Ledaig 18 anywhere in Texas, and online I'm looking at 160-200 dollar prices.
There's a lot going on, smoke, some sherry cask etc but it's very well balanced. Long finish.
I live in Michigan,  a liquor control state where they don't even sell ledaig.  But you can find them online from the UK for the prices I mentioned above ( not including shipping). There are many bottles that are cheaper for me to buy from the U.K and have them shipped internationally than they are for me to pick up on a local shelf,  as sad as that is.
Ya I need to get one
If it's any consolation, literally anything other than whisky is cheaper in the US than the UK. I once flew to NYC to buy a camera and it was still cheaper including the cost of the flight and the hotel than buying it in London. Of course this was in the days you could get a return to NYC for £200.
For example,  Tobermory 12 is $109.99 here ( state price). I can order 2 bottles from the whisky world,  pay for international shipping,  and still it comes in just slightly less or the same, cost wise. 😪
I've found a couple of Ledaig 10s here and there in Michigan, I'll snap up any I happen to find now!
Tob 12 is really good too! I've got a real soft spot for Bourbon only casked Scotch. As much as I like Sherry casks I can't shake the nagging feeling that it's a bit cheating to use a Sherry Cask.
Really,  I didn't even see it on the state list.  I'm in metro Detroit and I've never seen one. What area are you in, if you don't mind me asking
That's awesome!
I'm with you.  At the current moment in my whisky journey,  bourbon cask ( particularly refill) whisky is right up my alley.
I'm a bit west of Detroit, Farmington area.  They must have been some older bottles?  I dunno, but I'm glad to have found them!

Now all I can see on a regular basis is the Tobermory 12 at total wine.
Yeah,  I've been to the total wine on 8 mile and Haggerty. We just don't get all that much here because of our liquor laws.
That's the one lol!"
Tasting No. 40: Loch Lomond 2010 10yo OB TWE Exclusive - 57.7%,,https://i.redd.it/l7elqxmofz6b1.jpg,"*Tasting No. 40: Loch Lomond 2010 10yo OB Exclusive to The Whisky Exchange  - 57.7% ABV*

**Nose**: Loads of freshly cut oak, empty bourbon glass, runny honey, and agave syrup. Straw and, faintly, papery sherry. Simple and honest nose. Like Loch Lomond’s core expressions, this one strongly exudes a ‘Scotchy’ aspect that I cannot otherwise describe and do not really get on other single malts without water, likely a function of the active wood. More craft paper, papier-mâché,  glue, planks. It’s a woodshop! Rummy, though, with time– strongly resembles a 12-year 2012 ex bourbon Four Square rum I've got with their common woody dryness.

**Taste**: Rather prominent wood again, and simple; takes some time to get much else. Sunny, good-dispositioned Benrinnes-like–quite like the [10yo SCN](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/14bdfx5/tasting_no_34_benrinnes_10yo_single_cask_nation/) I recently had–and eventually turns to rum like the nose did. The ex-bourbon casks must have been quite wet ones; it is nice. A bowl of thick cream with vanilla pods scraped well, warmed thyme flower honey, herbed poultices with a lot of lavender…gets hotter with time, seemingly. Sun-warmed raspberries, woody bite of dry berry stems and pineapple core; chalk.

**Mouthfeel**: Really very decent at first, with just the lightest pop of heat and nicely thick and coating. Gets hotter later, but a single drop of water tames that–regrettably, at the expense of some of the thickness.

**Finish**: White pepper and balled melons…really strong on pale, pastel-colored foods. Lightly caramelized bananas at the darkest. Incredibly sunny, and I do think I like it more than the Benrinnes. Light caramelzation carries nicely. The finish is really very long, actually. Biut too much fresh-sawed wood for me, but what lasts is cherrystones, Madeira wine, and hazelnut paste. I detect aspects of the OB 12yo on the finish, but this younger cousin is certainly better.

**Score**: 82
Great review, I quite enjoyed my sample of this one (enough to grab a bottle) reasonably priced and a good range of flavours. I can see what you mean with the rum comparison too, there's definitely a certain amount of estery pop in this one, good stuff!

*Aged first for 9 years in ex-bourbon wood, this single malt was then kept in ex-Grattamacco (a drier red Tuscan coast wine) casks for nearly 2 years. It’s funny–when I was tasting the* [*Glenwyvis 3yo (blind),*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/11hk8s4/tasting_no_27_blind_glenwyvis_2018_3yo_batch_2/) *I was convincing myself that the red fruit, tannic notes in it were strong indicators it was this one. Amusing that when actually tasting this one, I didn’t land on the right one, despite actually getting red wine finish indicators from it too. Goes to show that a subtle wine finish can be a lovely thing–especially with the right wine.*

**Nose & Visuals:** Deep moderate-sweetness sherry, with a dankness nearing corruption. Wet pudding, brioche toast, and oats with a splash of rum-heavy syrup. Digestive biscuits and chocolate pot de creme. Moderately distinct, thick legs with a slow run.

**Taste**: Dryly spicy, wet old oak. Confiture of red fruits, plum skin, and cranberry. Chocolate-drizzled fruitcake–whatever sherry there is in here is quite well balanced.

Tasting No. 38: Isle of Raasay (R-02) - 46.4%,,https://i.redd.it/8twqbzulxt6b1.png,"*Tasting No. 38: Isle of Raasay (R-02) - 46.4%*

*Third in my miniseries of samples from new distilleries, Isle of Raasay sounds promising indeed. Vatting together peated and unpeated spirit in a combination of ex-rye, ex-red wine, and ex-Chinkapin oak, this new distillery with beautiful views of Skye sounds like quite a nice new voice in the Islands, and one to possibly make even that formidable steadfast of the Galactic Empire in the region, Talisker, tremble.*

**Nose**: Smoked salt and a mortar just done mashing very fresh-toasted spices. A bit of dampness and dirt–cumin and coriander, too–and loads of salted beach stones. It’s very Talisker on the news, with the whip of sea air. Perhaps a bit more sturdy, thick paper, and less sweet. Incredibly bracing nose.

**Taste**: Distant watermelon, generic red fruit candy drops, and a bit of beachside tractor tire rubber. Pencil shavings, and a quite nice dark tone of tobacco dusted with pipe ash. Some walnut oil, sunflower seeds, and warm toasted bran. It’s quite a tight flavor grouping–well-integrated neighbors here, nothing tugging away or distracting or hogging the limelight. Sticks rather to lighter savory chords, with some lighter-weight dark-to-bitter ones that work well together. Burnt sourdough crust, old travel trunk with aged leather, and a wholemeal soda bread (unsweet).

**Mouthfeel**: A squidge thin, but still flavorful; I’d love to try this at 50%.

**Finish**: Plenty of peppy spice, empty rye glass, sizzling smoked salt, and ashy smoke. Medium length.

**Comments**:  This is quite an interesting beast. It’s closer to Laphraoig than Talisker, in my view–no bad thing–but there is indeed a high resemblance to Islay all through. Their cask recipe I think is very nice, and is well balanced. Hugely competent entry from a new distillery; I wish I had more than 3cl to sample.

**Mental image/faux SMWS name**: That’s no moon

This is the most divisive bottle I sell. Love it or despise it.
Nice review. Probably pick up a bottle when it gets to 10-12 years
This Scotch reminds me of George Dickel with the minerality. I wasn’t sure initially but it grew on me. Not sure I’ll buy another bottle due to the Scotch journey but I enjoy the one I have.

Yeah it was a drain pour for me. Absolutely terrible. Personally I don't think those 3 casks mix well.
I literally just finished my bottle of this today. Nice but not great so I would say your rating is spot on though I was thinking more Talisker than Laphroaig. Just like everyone else, I can’t wait to see what a 10 or 12 year old expression is like in comparison to this."
Tasting No. 37 - Glenmorangie ‘Signet’ - 46%,,https://i.redd.it/mxt17fqptr6b1.jpg,"I am not big Glenmorangie fan but this is one special bottle. I buy it regularly even after the price hike
For anyone traveling through London Heathrow Airport, I was just there a few days ago and their duty free section had a great deal on this bottle. Came out to around $163 USD. At a price like that I had to pick one up.
*Tasting No. 37 - Glenmorangie ‘Signet’ - 46%*

*The platinum member of Glenmorangie’s core lineup, Signet has the distinction of having a bit of ‘chocolate’ malt–a higher degree of toast to the barley which has nothing to do with actual cocoa–in its mash bill, as well as reportedly a few drops of some older whisky in, as well. Commanding quite a higher price tag and a bottle that reminds you of it, Signet is generally spoken well of.*

**Nose**: Marsala and zabaglione, with a heavy hand on the marsala. Tarter, dusty-glassed, musty wine--no sweeter than a fino sherry. Thick dust, freeze-dried raspberries, old stone, and macerated strawberry. And, power of suggestion be damned, a heady blast of darkly brewed coffee straightaway. Concrete dust gusts in, with plenty of red fruit jam. Stale chocolate crumbs and the dark undertones of an emptied port glass on hardwood. Varnished old wood, stiff dusty paper, and, finally, some proper Oloroso, with fermented cashews: nutty-sweet, with a quenelle of mascarpone.

**Taste**: There’s some age whispering here: old leaves crackle, an entire leather folio lies open on dusty wood. A pot of caramelized cranberry jam. The neck pour was very notably chocolate and coffee straight away, but subsequent drams take more time to darken. The age of whatever older casks are vatted here is more noticeable on later tastings, and the maltiness is also quite notable. Toasty chocolate cake crumbs, soda bread crusts, and port. Dignified and stately, like aged Cognac teaspooned with good Cointreau. Darkens towards coffee in the glass at last–initially, milky cappuccino, but eventually beautifully roasted beans, gloriously perfect lightly sweetened coldbrew, and a splash of sweeter coffee liqueur. There’s a funny chord of soy sauce I get that sits at the darkest edge of the flavors and lingers, popping in and out of sight–-but it’s minor. The last sip is of espresso that has had a twist of orange peel sitting in it for a while.

**Mouthfeel**: This is the most glorious mouthfeel of any bottling at 46% I’ve had, beating out even my treasured box of Campbeltowns (with my apologies to the peninsula). Soft and wonderful and light, with a sinuous silkiness. It’s like drinking Harry Potter’s invisibility cloak after he spilled a coffee-chocolate cocktail on it in the Restricted Section. *Such* a Potter thing to do.

**Finish**: Finishes on dark roasted grapeskin, tame oak tannins, espresso-drizzled ganache, and the smell of an empty sherry glass. Moderate to short.

Great review. This one was a miss for me. It was decent, don’t get me wrong, but wasn’t worth the price I paid. The mouthfeel on my batch was also very thin. 

Seems like you got a good one.
I had a sample of this which I really loved, so I got a whole bottle. Either my taste buds have been super off when I had the sample (twice), or the difference in batches is enormous. This is the only bottle I ever regretted buying...
That bottle is sexy af too
I had a couple drama of that at the distillery just the other day.  It has some nice coco and coffee characteristics!
We had this bottle for a group tasting pre pandemic - it was incredible BUT since then the price has ballooned significantly and I have to say there are other whisky’s in the similar range now that out class it. Which is a shame because I love the signet line.
Man I need some dark roasted grape skin in my life
Your Harry Potter references are funny. Are those wand boxes in the picture?
Better review than mine. I missed the gillyweed somehow, among others. This is one of my top three.
Did you mean “Marsala?” You said “masala,” which is a Hindi/Urdu word for spice. I doubt you meant to say that it smells like cumin, coriander, cardamom, etc, but maybe you did…
Fantastic review!
Lovely whisky
Love this bottle. Reminds me of mocha mudslides back in the day
A true pleasure to sip!
When you need to buy a gift for someone Signet will be there for you.
Confirming that I just bought it for 134 pounds in Heathrow.  Best to reserve it online 2-3 days prior to departure.

Tasting No. 36 - Kilkerran OB 12yo - 46%,,https://i.redd.it/cqms0vogam6b1.jpg,"*Tasting No. 36 - Kilkerran OB 12yo - 46%*

**Nose**: Clean stone, rained-upon slate, and the petrichor that I associate strongly with Springbank. Beautiful malt, stone-floored dunnage, damp straw, and old estate barn wood. Fresher barley and brooding stone dust are such an intriguing pair here. The sweetness is very purely barley: no hiding behind sweet wine influence or the shout of wood. There’s plenty of hay, both fresh and old, and a slight whiff of Sauternes. The freshness is somewhat yeasty, and nears beeriness at times. Eventually, with resting, the sherry is detectable (this is meant to be 20% sherry-aged casks). Soft metallics hover as an overtone to the yeastiness. This is quite a lively nose, and reminds me somewhat of Clynelish in both their old fashioned soap kind of ways.

**Taste**: Hidden peatsmoke emerges first, shyly, but among–and situated proportionally within–all the elements from the nose, shuffling back in on the palate as well. The peat is dank–very old dunnage, stone and clots of earth–and peppery and really rather perfect, and lends masterful balance to the sip. A nearly Champagne-like dryness–Brut, I suppose–and some apricot liqueur and old, old Grand Marnier. Unexpectedly, a punch of preserved lemon–altogether the citrus and salt and slight bitterness of pith parts. Peat, metal filings vaguely, the wan ghost of sherry-sweetness, and notable ale notes have a little quartet, their harmonies contending with reedy, lighter aromatics: cream infused with lavender, cocoa butter, oat milk, and a small tin of pomelo-scented hand cream. The beeriness eventually dissipates into copper.

**Mouthfeel**: Excellent for 46%, and leaves nothing to be desired: filling, coating, and utterly flawless. Has a gorgeous feeling of effervescence and oily lightness that is exquisitely airy while also somehow weighty. It isn’t the thickest, gooiest mouthfeel ever, but frankly I can’t fault a thing; this excels many others even at this strength.

**Finish**: Lasts forever, and then a bit after that. Aromatics–mostly on herbs and fermenting apples and Sauternes-poached pears–some tarragon and caraway, and a bit of basil-heavy numbing oil. Copper and iron filings, soaked prune, cold Earl Grey, and clay. A long time later, the signature petrichor and slate are still there. Amazing.

Tasting No. 35 - Nc'nean Quiet Rebels 'Annabel' - 48.5%,,https://i.redd.it/rrha9adr2m6b1.png,"Lol I thought this was an advertisement for cologne
*Tasting No. 35 - Nc'nean Quiet Rebels 'Annabel' - 48.5%*

*New distillery Nc’nean’s autumnally-bottled series is called Quiet Rebels, with different incarnations taking the names of the employees who picked the casks. Lovely.*

**Nose**: Freshest peaches and dusty stonefruit skins, with dashes of a light, juicy sherry. There’s some rosy undercurrent, with plenty of blossoms and wildflower honey and mahleb. Plum skin comes through quite specifically, but with air, somewhat darkens, acquiring light nuttiness; however, remains very much juicy stonefruit-forward. Peach gum candies, powdery candy shop sweets, and even some talc.

**Taste**: Fresh and lightly roasted peaches, an empty Sauternes glass, and cream with a hint of elderflower liqueur. Briefly steeped black tea, but without woody tannins. A bit of allspice, red licorice, and black pepper warmth. Certain plum lozenges and prune juice. This speaks to whisky older than its apparent 3 years, but the heat of its youth keeps it from being mistaken for something more mature. The heat, over time, does rather grow to become slightly eye-prickling. From among the fruits, spices ascend, cinnamon heat dominant, and daubs of beeswax.

**Mouthfeel**: Nicely silky; it’s thin but has a lovely oiliness. It is quite nice.

**Finish**: Some orange blossom water, indistinct perfume notes, and an elusive aromatic that hovers between basil and tarragon. Either way, entirely fresh and hugely of gardens throbbing with the full green flicker of life.

**Comments**: This punches well above its weight class for a young whisky; the small factors that set it back are those that a little more cask time will surely take care of. Interestingly, the cask recipe here is not, to me, immediately obvious; while I’d guess at a combination involving ex-Oloroso with certainly some ex-bourbon, it doesn’t scream of loud wood or loud wine, but is all rather itself and well-incorporated, which is a virtue for me.Upon further research, the distillery’s lovely website details the cask recipe for its ‘Annabel’ bottling of 2018, which is apparently 64% ex-bourbon, 22% ex-Tojaki (fascinating!) and 7% each STR red wine and PX sherry.

Sounds quite lovely
I'm excited by this distillery. Thanks for the review.
Not just you. These are so pretty, they invariably remind me of a high-end cologne or perfume.
My tasting evaluation system aims to evaluate whiskies sampled relative to my personal enjoyment, which skews towards moderately peated and nuanced whiskies with long finishes and lighter, intriguing subtleties emerging from within smoke.

I categorize each whisky relative to others that I have enjoyed approximately that much within designated scoring bands. What I am looking for as I taste is:

* Balance (cask/distillate, peat/distillate, cask/peat, flavors...)
* Complexity
* Pleasingness (flavor, lack of off-notes, finish, mouthfeel & texture, general enjoyability)
* Integration (alcohol, peat, cask)

This sounds like a great subtle and balanced dram, thanks! How would you rate the value?
I’ve got a bottle of this and your notes are very recogniseable! Well done!
Ikr. Like with a touch of a famine scent
A bottle was about £80 which is a bit steep IMHO for the quality. But it is also 100% organic certified, carbon neutral, very pretty recycled glass bottle and a new distillery so also kinda OK if you care for that stuff (like I do).
It’s hard to say, as I got mine in the form of a sample from The Whisky Exchange, which was certainly not an excellent value by volume, but was meant to provide an opportunity to taste new distilleries without obligating to the full size format, which are less common in my area for this and other young distilleries anyway. I don’t think I’d want to pay more than $60 for 70 cl, if I were to value my own enjoyment of it, but I would order a dram of it out.
Yep, nothing like the smell of having no food..."
Tasting No. 34 - Benrinnes 10yo (Single Cask Nation) - 55.6%,,https://i.redd.it/gequ92yqah6b1.png,"*Tasting No. 34 - Benrinnes 10yo (Single Cask Nation) - 55.6%*  
**Nose**: A tarter Clynelish, more skin and less flesh but just as orchard fruit-laden. Pencil shavings and graphite and a good bundle of oak twigs. A decent gust of heat on the nose up front, but not exactly ethanol burn. Fresh greenery, split logs, and cold green and chamomile teas. Loads of orchard must and, with all the wood, rather bourbonlike indeed.  
**Taste**: Cherry stems and underripe apple. Tannic but honey-swirled tea, dried apple, and, on the more savory side, a whiff of powdered turmeric root. A bit boring, altogether. Pears and apples of course–it’s all rather bright and cheery and uncomplicatedly predictable. Not a single objectionable not to point to, however–just not wowing. Comes off with dried banana, powdery lemon candy lozenges, some other citrus gums and a load of peach rings, crusted sugar and all. Bourbon oak, a little slate, and some chalk-dusted paper.   
**Mouthfeel**: Splendidly thick–unsurprising at this ABV. Quite hot on some tastings, with the sizzle coming later on as well as up front. Nice in the mouth, though.  
**Finish**: Fresh cider, runny caramel, apple brandy, and more fresh wood. Tannins dry the tongue, and applewood turns spicier, to some sweet drops like Ricola, but more savory. Altogether, I think the ex-bourbon treatment this run got was a good illustration of Benrinnes character, but didn’t thrill. It came in for me exactly where the OB Clynelish 14yo did–the two are quite similar to me–but, that said, this does quite well what it aims to: it’s brightly dispositioned and generally quite a sunny sip.

Tasting No. 33 - Glen Scotia ‘Victoriana’ - 54.2%,,https://i.redd.it/gfimcgd2yo4b1.png,"*Tasting No. 34 - Glen Scotia ‘Victoriana’ - 54.2%*

**Nose**: Charred wood and well-cooked caramel. Dark granary space, acetone, and damp, dank basement. Despite the char, utterly smokeless. Hints of plasticine, but different to the peated GS 10yo, which was dramatically hot-plasticky to me. With the grain and dark sweetness, very much at the border of sweet and acrid; reminiscent, in some ways, of an old Johnnie Walker I had, with the grain offering acetone, some acridity, and simple sweetness, but also an edge to the barley’s different sugariness.

**Taste**: The heat leaps forward foremost here despite a non-too-aggressive strength, but quickly fades. It’s fairly consistent to the nose, with a good amount of char, ample malt, musty oak, and generic caramel sweetness. Pleasant and peculiar, but doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. The char lingers, drying, with a fine sprinkling of salt atop; that ethanol-grain note from the nose is not as present here, but its lingering acridity is, mostly in the bitterness of ash. It is quite unsweet–which is nice and refreshing–but also not meaty or vegetal–a rare state. More must and a thick dusting of pure cocoa powder in terms of its drying quality and near-bitterness.

**Mouthfeel**: Lovely, thick, and in keeping with its strength. No disappointments here.

**Finish**: Surprisingly short, with just a flurry of char notes, really. But for the mustiness note, I might even have placed this for a 20+yo grain whisky: the simplicity quite surprised me. Char mutates, adding sweetness, until it becomes the bruleed top to a custard. Closes dryly on ash, burnt sugar, and iron filings. Finally, there’s is a faint echo of the Double Cask in the close, with the dryness briefly giving way to a sweet dankness. Blind, I would have a hard time placing this one: it could easily be an off-profile IB of a bunch of places.

I'm a fan of a previous batch, but haven't tried the 2022. So fascinating that this is the same whisky that another reviewer gave a 2.5 out of 10! I'm a fan of the Victoriana, but with all of its funk it appears like there may be bottle-to-bottle variation along with the batch variation.

Tasting No. 32 - Loch Lomond OB 12yo - 46%,,https://i.redd.it/x4tqaxnuku2b1.png,"*Tasting No. 32 - Loch Lomond OB 12yo - 46%*

**Nose**: Tight and dense - tightly wound sherry jelly and damp cardboard, quite reminiscent of the Bunnahabhain Stiuireadair’s nose. Applesauce and highly fermented cider speak loudly. Almost a little garbage-y, but just evades outright rot. Wet garam masala and a bit of numbing oil with anise and licorice.  Hugely earthly, with the sweetness of decay in abundance. Seems rather cask aggressive cask influence, but not fresh sawdust woodiness. Very much notes of forest: a woodsy, boggy peatsmoke minor chord–nearly vegetally dark, despite all the fruity decay. A bit astringent at times, but overwhelmingly what dominates is near-rotting apple. The decay note blows off with time in the glencairn, remaining a subtle but not vanished fermentative funk amid cereal notes.

**Taste**: Quite pleasant! Significantly fresher than I’d have expected from the nose. Warm apples, burnt honey with bay leaf, cassia bark and lots of fresh cereals. The fermented apple butter remains, with a certain fizziness I associate with apple cider to reinforce the image. It’s honestly a little Springbank-like, with around the same peating level, but with its core centered around applesauce rather than Springbank 10yo's pineapple curd and metal filings. A few minutes in, the puff of smoke rolls in,  a quite lovely balance of that with fruit and spice. The rancio, near-overwhelming in the nose, is gone, and it’s much fresher and sprightly now–beerish yeasts, porridge, aged apple butter, orange marmalade, and even empty Grand Marnier glass. Hints of a waxless Clynelish with all the fruitiness, but it's less fresh fruit than Clynelish. Turns somewhat chocolatey, with dipped orange peel and chocolate shortbread with toasted bran.

**Mouthfeel**: Pleasant buzz of near-effervescence in the mouthfeel–which, though not milkshake-thick, is very far from thin indeed. It's plenty flavorful at 46%. No offputting heat or, really, any other major complaints.

**Finish**: The wood influence has a dry bite that lingers, but it’s not too drying. Lingers on plum jam with skins in, stewed blackberries, and a green, just off-bitter woodiness, like stems. The smoke is just a pinhead’s worth, but welcome and balances nicely. Coin-metal, berry skins, and the astringency of a dry white wine. Again here, the freshness of the wood influence on the palate is quite different to the nose. A few crumbles of frangipane, buttery oat biscuit, sweetned tea, and weak rose jelly in a milk chocolate shell.

*Not overly complicated, but a hugely enjoyable surprise relative to its price point. What a chameleon Loch Lomond is; I think this might embarrass a lot of people in a blind lineup with some Campbeltowns declared to be in the mix. Which gives me a fun idea...*
Great review!

I really do think the Lomond 12 year bottlings (Inchmurrin and Inchmoan included) are some of the best value vs quality available in scotch right now, never boring, characterful and at a good abv.
For a good while in my state, this was priced at $35, then $40. It only just at the start of May leaped to $60. It had become my de facto house pour, and I loaded up before the price jump. Recent batches have been less peaty than a few years ago, but I still find it consistently enjoyable especially at its price point. Add a few drops of a peater, and you can pretend you're drinking Springbank 10 that you can both find and afford.
spot on, i couldnt quite pin down what the cloying sweetness reminded me of but that rotting fruit fizz is exactly what i cant get past w this dram...
Good review! This one has always been a bit of a chameleon for me - sometimes I enjoy it a lot, sometimes not at all. It feels like it can be open and fruity, or sometimes dry and a bit tannic, to an unpleasant degree.
My tasting evaluation system aims to evaluate whiskies sampled relative to my personal enjoyment, which skews towards moderately peated, spicy, rich and nuanced whiskies with long finishes and lighter, intriguing subtleties emerging from within smoke. 

I liken the reviewed whisky to others that I have enjoyed approximately that much within my designated scoring bands; this may see some brow-raising comparisons of comparatively youthful expressions to longer-matured or rarer ones; it is because my scale focuses on how much I enjoyed the example drams that a 90+ score may have a reasonably pedestrian whisky rather than a quadruple-organic hand-picked Martian barley Bruichladdich expression aged 143 years in Napoleon’s autographed Yggdrasil wood cask that once held the tears of Vespasian. Enjoyment is everything.

*The peated entry level into Benriach’s core line, this Highlander vats a combination of unpeated and peated spirit in three cask types  for at least ten years: ex-bourbon barrels, ex-Jamaican rum casks, and toasted virgin oak. Highland smoke is a real treat, so let’s see if this overshoots its* [unpeated sister (73)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/13l6fdd/tasting_no_30_benriach_ob_classic_10yo_43/)*.*

**Nose**: Earthy, delightful foresty peat. Damp earth and wet bark…quite Benromach 10 actually, with the peppery snap of spice from the sherry. Medium-faint smoke comes in, and remains. Not much else, though. A bit of chocolate and drop of red wine becoming chocolate-covered cherry and some oven-roasted raspberry. Compact, concentrated red fruits. Interestingly, it noses somewhat like the 2021 Kilchoman Loch Gorm that I so enjoyed (but finished somehow without formally reviewing. It’d have been an 89-90 range easily), which is a high compliment indeed for all the wacky wood. It’s a lot quieter than the Kilchoman, though.

**Taste**: Rather yeasty, of rising chelsea buns and a but of burnt parchment. Pears with stems on, dried coriander, and green branches. Cherrywood, especially...smoked maple syrup. The wood influence is not oak planky, thank goodness, but it’s certainly active wood. Toasted pecans, a little over-toasted with the tannic snap. Horehound candy, rootbeer barrel sweets, and red licorice pipes. Lovely spice bit here. The sweetness is competently balanced, but doesn’t astound exactly. The smoke is rather MIA, despite the early promise. I could do with a bit more.

**Mouthfeel**: So forgettable I forgot to take notes. Like the Classic 10. Pattern? Pattern.

**Finish**: Floorboard–suddenly and noticeably. Certainly sherry on the finish…a little like a punchier OB Dalmore. Here the smoke simply becomes the frame rather than the picture itself. Turns into a puff of smoked salt at the closeout. The triple wood maturation does a lot of the heavy lifting here; the age and distillate character are just along for the ride.

*The entry level into Benriach’s core line, the unpeated 10yo boasts a vatting of spirit matured for at least ten years in an undisclosed mix of bourbon barrels, sherry casks, and virgin oak.*

**Nose**: Rather spirity…a loud chorus of apple cider, maple syrup, and very active oak. Dried herbs keep it from a sticky forgetfulableness - some marjoram, savory, and allspice, even. The sherry is the fainter of the influences from the wood, and it keeps the nose a bit tight. Dried apples and fritter come to mind as the spiritiness relaxes.

**Taste**: Alcohol heat at first dissipates to orange oil with a bit of leather. Thank goodness. Walnuts, cake with orange blossom water, and wood–orange oil-rubbed planks. The oak influence gets more pronounced as time passes, and the walnuts mercifully get toastier to compensate. This is very much sticking to the lighter side–  no toast, no burned aspect, no chocolate or coffee darkness: the sherry helps round out that balance, though. It has a very lightly perfumed quality like lavender soap or a flower honey…lilacs, or honeysuckle perhaps. The dryness and fruit aspects work up into a dried mango.

**Mouthfeel**: So forgettable I forgot to take notes.

**Finish**: Tight embrace of oak on the finish. Quite woody, really. It’s nearly a tame American rye. Spicebox wood, with nutmeg and a little cinnamon warmth.

*The working class of Glen Scotia’s core expressions, the Double Cask is matured in American oak with a Pedro Ximenez sherry finish job. Sampled from a 2.5cL...pipette.*

**Nose**: Sticky toffee and a strong roar from the PX. Fresh bran and caramel-flecked granola and a plate of sliced wheat toast. It’s not a wild ride: oaky vanilla, apple compote, light parchment from the sherry, and a faint hint of char. The fresh sweetness blows off eventually, exposing cold caramel, millionaire’s shortbread with sea salt, and digestive biscuits.

**Taste**: Pleasing, but not titillating. Quite a bowlful of sticky toffee, pain perdu, challah with sultanas, and a teasing waft of bergamot. Again, just a tiptoe of char. Toasty sweets and well-baked pastries: toasted pain aux raisins, overbaked rum baba, cider donuts, and a hint of copper, like old pennies. Spiced apple caramel drizzle, perhaps. The PX is decently incorporated here – they timed the finish well. The main issue I have is that it doesn’t evolve at all; it’s not boring, but it does lack complexity–or the kind of complexity I like.

**Mouthfeel**: Light, and just a tinge hot–though I probably could have aired the sample longer.**Finish**: Finishes on grapeskin, oak tannins, and the smell of an empty sherry glass. Fairly short.

*One of Highland distillery AnCnoc’s peated NAS line named after implements of whiskycraft, Rutter comes in a respectable integrity strength of 46%, peated to 11ppm. This one nearly soured my impression early on with a cork that turned itself into a fine cork powder upon having the temerity to open it, so this tasting was extra aerated from the pouring off of the entire bottle through a sieve to get the cork bits out, and then recanting it into its bottle.Nose: Subtle smokes and fresh apple juice to open. Mouthwateringly tart apple, some drier minerality and flint, and low earthy tones: clay. A remote herbal quality lingers - some dried fenugreek or turmeric. The smokiness, earth, and herbs together sing. When I was filtering the cork out of this, smoke was very detectable, along with some juice orchard fruit notes.*

**Taste**:  The smoke, rambunctious at first, very quickly fades away, leaving a basket of apples and a single pear. The subtle herbs really add a lovely harmony here – into tarragon now, with a cracked black pepper tarka–really steering this one towards an unexpected and delightful savory middle ground. It reminds me quite a bit of a charming Islay cask-finished IB Ardmore I had, but with less fermenty cider tones. The smoke and earth and herbs form the three members of a quite lovely little chord. It’s not a massively complex leather-and-libraries sip, but I’m really quite liking it. As evidenced by the volume I’ve written here (after calling it not complex) I’m getting a surprising amount from it.

Smoke incorporates itself brilliantly the longer this sits. The apples get cooked the tiniest bit as time goes on, but the whole thing remains interestingly salt-less–a rather nice effect, as I’ve been accustomed to the Islay and Islands sodium dose with my peatsmoke.I get the feeling this was all ex-bourbon wood, and I don’t at all find myself wishing for any sherry influence here; this is lovely and moreish. A few crumbs of buttery crust, some roasted vegetables, sunflower oil, and a goblet of mead. With water, ash comes to the fore, and much else is lost.

**Mouthfeel**: Heat caught me a little off guard at first, for this ABV–bit prickly. The mouthfeel is fine–not luxurious and not thin. It’s globally really quite dry–not at all drizzly or sappy–and I find it works.

**Finish**: Quite fine. Lingering buttery pinot grigio, iron and lovely dry minerals, a smidge of cumin, and more iron. A tablespoon of burnt honey. The smoke is so well incorporated at this point as to be barely a whisper. Apple juice, a bit of wine-soaked cask wood, and a light cloud of woodsmoke close it out.

"Tasting No. 27 (blind) Glenwyvis 2018 3yo Batch 2 (46.5%, OB)",,https://i.redd.it/d6fdqyyi6mla1.jpg,"*Tasting No. 27 (blind) Glenwyvis 2018 3yo Batch 2 (46.5%, OB)*

After purchasing a number of samples–some of which were distillery mini core lineup packs but more of which were Perfect Measure 3cL samples–I decided to do some of them as blind tastings–or at least semi-blind, since I knew the totality of the samples purchased. To keep it fun, I asked my spouse to select and pour for me; I tasted with only the liquid to inform me as to the contents, and, to grade myself, adopted the SMWS holiday blind tournament’s standards for guesses: ABV, age, region, maturation profile, and distillery (though that was only a tiebreaker in the SMWS blinds).This was the third pour.

This [6yo Ben Nevis IB](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/11bt3du/tasting_no_23_blind_ben_bevis_6yo_elixir_584_abv/) was the first, and the [Port Askaig 100 Proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/11dtazo/tasting_no_25_blind_port_askaig_100_proof_571/) was second.

Though I don’t typically make notes of such information in my tastings apart from peripherally, for this series I did note the color and viscosity to help identity maturation and ABV. In this case, the color was a pale Chardonnay, indicating all or nearly all ex-bourbon maturation, but with a distinct rosé tinge. I do wonder if there were multiple casks--including that, or perhaps red wine--in the mix. Thin legs - already appears likely to be not cask strength.

**Nose**: Buttered popcorn on the open, quickly turning to a glass of rosé. Somewhere in this blind is going to be a Glenallachie aged in an Italian red, and that thought might just be haunting--and deceiving--me. The rosé parts, allowing some charred oak and a small stack of slate tablets. Earthy petrichor, damp soil, and wet stone. A few sticks of chalk and grape must on the pile, too. Deeper in, burre noisette and toasted pecans. It's globally slightly creamy, but the oak presence is notable. Closes out freshly, with bruised fresh herbs--probably tarragon.

**Taste**:  Toasty malt, fairly obvious oak, and a rogue splash of that damned rosé (I like rosé). Nuttiness makes itself known over the toasted oak notes--nut butters and spreads--seedy, even. The mouthfeel and taste pick up quite a lot of wine acidity and minerality. It's still very fresh and light, but the toastiness and nuts linger. I think there's some sneaky Oloroso in here, but a blend of casks, not a finish. Agave syrup and lime marmalade are how the tartness manifest themselves now--and some dry, off-sour wheat ales--nearly a gose or a not-too-sour sour ale.

**Mouthfeel**: It's certainly 46%. I know it's partially the dryness and lightness on the palate informing my opinion, but there really is no fattiness or thickness to the sip here.

**Finish**: Yeasty, and plenty of wine atmospherics: dry, mineralic, acid tartness, and with a bitterness that lingers--a pith bitterness, or underripe blackberry. Medium length.

**Final Thoughts**: It's certainly young, and it's certainly not a distillate I've tasted before. I'm taken aback by the prominence of the tart red wine notes here. The tartness at times is too much for me (despite loving tart, sharp, and bitter in most other things), and the bitterness at points is overly drying and too hopslike.

**Guesses**:

**Region**: Highlands

**Age**: Young. Under 7 years easily. Given that this is so youthful tasting and so unfamiliar to me, I am guessing this is one of the new-new distilleries to pop up, and so fairly likely even a few years under 7.

**Maturation**: blend of refill ex-bourbon, some Oloroso, some red wine

**ABV**: 46%

**Distillery**: I know I don't know it. One of the new ones. No specific guesses.

**Reveal**: Glenwyvis (Highlands) 2018 3yo (Batch 2), 46.5%, OB

Well, there we have it. I am pleased to have gotten the broad strokes of it right -- young, Highlands, new distillery, 46%. My curiosity over the rosé note prompted me to look into what casks went into Batch 2.The Glenwyvis online shop is still [selling Batch 2](https://glenwyvis.com/product/glenwyvis-single-malt-whisky-batch-02-18-700ml/), so I was able to determine I was, in fact, nuts: Batch 2 is aged in a combination of American Tennessee whiskey barrels, Spanish Oloroso casks, and ""refilled Scotch whisky hogsheads""--which, looking at their casks offering page, are probably former Glenwyvis-holding casks. No rosé, no real red wine at all, but at least the toasty nut profile I identified as Oloroso wasn't altogether misplaced.
Great review! Nice way of narrowing it down. How did you so in the SMWS blind challenge? What did you think about the whisky itself? Worth the price? Promising for the future? Or bottles too early?"
Tasting No. 25 - Glen Scotia 25yo OB - 46%,,https://i.redd.it/ak6qyef1x6la1.jpg,"*Tasting No. 25 - Glen Scotia 25yo OB - 46%*

An old, OB Glen Scotia – in the absolutely tiniest bottle I’ve ever seen. Previously having only tried the [peated 10yo OB](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/xqrhuj/tasting_no_12_glen_scotia_10_year_peated_46_abv/) offering (which I found interesting in a ‘probably won’t rebuy but happy to have tried’ way), this should be a different experience, I expect. Whereas the 10yo had a distinctly smoked Glenfiddich vibe but with a distinct hot plastic water bottle in the sun note that I associate with Glen Scotia peat. I expected this to be an unpeated offering - but, as you will see, I was wrong.

**Nose**: Very unexpected peat right away - the sharp, quite chemical Glen Scotia peat here in abundance right off–very reminiscent of the OB peated 10 year old . Fresher afterwards, not in the least bit stuffy - of grass, that plasticky note the 10 year also had, and essence of vanilla. Hot toasted walnuts, polished leather, saddle grease, and the dusty scent of old curtains take over. A sherry note–sweet, PX possibly–is present in a distant accompanying way, joined by an unexpectedly jazzy fennel and grape mash under sweet focaccia dough. Chalky sweetness, as of candy hearts, that is lightly but non-specifically fruity - a glass bowl of boiled sweets too. The peat disappears a little bit in, outmurmured by the sweeter tones. The entirety of the dram actually seems to shrink away on the nose the longer it sits, peatsmoke most of all. At last, all that remains is the dusty chords of antique sherry: delicate leather, warm if tame mixed spice, newsprint…crackling thick paper and crumbles of old manuscript. It’s very dignified, this.

**Taste**: Deep raisin tones but with colorful flickers that lighten to blood orange syrup, old Cognac, and prune cake. Fruit, either fermenting or decaying - yeastiness and wine-slick wood, dried dusty fruits, a few slices of teacake. And waxes, oils, and polishes. Aged paper, an occasional subtle ripple of plasticky peat…finishes on winestained manuscripts, the vineyard cooperage in autumn, a pinhead of peatsmoke, and old spicebox. Splendid. So many phases to this one. I wish I had more than this pipsqueak 1.25cL joke.

**Mouthfeel**: A curious one. While not watery, the physical effect of this whisky was somewhat…airy. This is not to say it was weak; but it was not the weighty thickness that some whiskies entail. Haven’t had anything quite like it.

**Finish**: Despite the airiness of the mouthfeel, the finish is somewhat lasting…polenta cake with a honey syrup, old used wine barrel wood, but no oaky tannins, empty Pinot glass, and more crumbled vellum. A faint prickle of peat, but deep down. Mostly old fruit, tame old wine rancio, and light corruption remain. There is a quality of molder, aging, and droop here that, despite sounding terrible, isn’t at all so; it’s a very Ms. Havisham’s Library dram. No, wait – it’s…

Finally something interesting. I've tried it once and decided it's not worth the money. I can easily choose something better suited for me for that price. I am curious would you pay 500 bucks for that?
Great review. Personally, I enjoy the Victoriana and IB Gordon & Macphail 23 yr bottle more than the OB Glen Scotia 25 yr. I was able to find it last year at 21st Amendment in Indianapolis, Indiana for $245.00, and I wouldn’t pay much more than that for it. IMO
I have a 25yo IB from whisky agency and I with it was better, tastes a bit like a perfumed grandma
Where do you find little bottles like that? I'm new to Scotch and it would be cool to try some out before buying a big bottle

Hm. If pressed, like you, I think I would choose something else—or several somethings—for the same price point, as $500 can go a long way, especially for equally aged—or equally complex—dram from perhaps not as well known distillery, or an exquisite IB. That said, this was special, well-crafted, and with no qualities I begrudged.

In this case, pale color indicated all or nearly all ex-bourbon maturation.

**Nose**: Tarry and spiritedly pungent; billowing ships’ smokestacks and the meatiness of lightly salted jerky. The slight astringency of Caol Ila ash–a profile distinctly lacking strong fruit aspects at first, though after the smoke blows off somewhat, some grill-smoked pineapple comes up with light metal filings.  I’m already strongly thinking Caol Ila here, but the meatiness has some Ardbeg notes. The ash is different, though.

**Taste**: Char and embers, thick exhaust, and a cutting hint of vinegar complimenting the savory tones of paprika and BBQ crisps. Beneath, the raw elemental sense of hot iron. Lastly, there’s burnt sugar-sweetness and the lively flicker of rye-like spice. This is likely young; there aren’t many complexities, though I am enjoying the aspects it presents. I’d put it under 10 years–perhaps 7–but it’s probably a NAS.

**Mouthfeel**: Decent enough - not watery or weak. Not precisely thick, either.

**Finish**: Burnt medieval cake crusts and lingering meat char, but contrasted with a lovely deeply toasted vanilla bean hue. Fireplace ash, some toasted oak, and a few drizzles of cream. The vinegar holds out in the finish, but a little closer to faint red wine now. Fatty, tallow-like residue hangs on the palate–a whole tallow candle, complete with the tiny bitter bite of its ashy wick. The low bloom of oxidized red wine closes it out.

**Final Thoughts**: It’s a Viking holiday feast dram. I love it when tasting notes coalesce into a coherent image. Quite confident on it being Caol Ila, young, but the ABV is slippery.

Region: Islay

Age: 7 years

Douglas Laing–whose Rock Island blend I [recently reviewed and liked](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/zwglga/tasting_no_21_rock_island_douglas_laing_blended/)–issues an annual Christmas edition of its Big Peat blended malt, which is a cask strength edition. This bottle, the 2021, comes in at 52.8%, and comprises, in some undisclosed proportion, Bowmore, Ardbeg, Caol Ila, and (*snork*!) Port Ellen.   
**Nose**: Caol Ila ash and char up front, as well as that Chardonnay barrel note I always seem to get with Caol Ila and young Lagavulin. Brined sailcloth, a whiff of tar, and artificial lemon cleanser. Plenty of crushed seashells. A nicely brash peater. Afterthought of chocolate deep down as well, and plenty of black pepper and seaweed. The ash is not shy, but the smoke is the light and pleasingly dry-bitter kind with hints of sweeter chocolate beneath. There’s plenty of (young) Caol Ila in here, it would seem, but its fellow malts are singing with it rather well.   
**Taste**: Prickly pepper-heat, tar, and tobacco, with a light dusting of fine ash. It’s rather tamer than the nose, and there are some lovely soft tones of dark chocolate, bergamot Earl Grey tea (Bowmore?), and even tea-infused chocolate ganache. It’s surprisingly dessert–the smoke incorporates seamlessly, and even gets lost at times with the range of velvety dessert notes. Some oak and lapsang souchong, more tobacco–a nearly leathery cigar-richess. Some mixed spice–smoked cinnamon, perhaps, and heavy on the dried orange peel. A packet of chocolate truffles. After the initial waves of Caol Ila ash, it’s pleasing how smoothly the malts work together – this is harmony. Ardbeg (a named constituent of this blend) grill char and singed meat is down there on the darker side, and really sticks around after the truffle notes fade out. Bouche de noel, even–with a certainly creamy lightness.  
**Mouthfeel**: Decent - it is not harsh at above 52%, and certainly no timid voice. The malts speak.  
**Finish**: Darkest chocolate lingers, with plenty of wet tobacco and a faint puff of ash. Citrus peel tannins provide lighter aromatic notes, and toasted almonds–nearly burnt–and deeply caramelized orange slices linger.

This was the first pour. Though I don’t typically make notes of such information in my tastings apart from peripherally, for this series I did note the color and viscosity to help identity maturation and ABV. In this case, the legs were incredibly slow and stuck in oily drops in the glass, indicating an ABV easily of 50% or more. The color was fairly dark, but the nose screamed sherry loud enough that the color nudge wasn’t necessary.

&#x200B;

**Nose**: Strong blast of sherry, presenting as chocolate and cherries, rich dacquoise, hazelnut praline, and an interestingly sharper tone much like rhubarb–leaning towards plum skin, even. In the background, darker shades approaching deep mocha. Quite well-integrated. The nose stays on the lighter side for how sherried it appears visually–it’s not a thick-as-clots PX monster. I’m assuming a lot of Oloroso, not full PX maturation.

**Taste**: Puddingy-rich. A little crackle of heat here, but the alcohol is incorporated rather well. Cherry-almond clafoutis, toasted hazelnuts, and cake with berry pate de fruits. Some vineyard notes–wine barrel, cognac, and even tart cherry juice–but mostly sticks to medium-heaviness desserts: chestnut gateau, coffee friands, and frangipane. Lovely.

**Mouthfeel**: Really lovely–among the best, in fact. Hugely thick and silky and seems to emulsify like zabaglione in the mouth–rich like syrup, coating. Stunning.

**Finish**: More on the cognac overtones, slightly wine-forward; a little tannic oak and maltiness. The nuts and maltiness remain strong, always with that wine overtone–Frangelico in a used cognac glass. Thick, dark chords of port come in too. Nicely lasting.

**Final Thoughts:** I appreciate that the sherry wood–a PX finish, I assume–despite being potent, is far from overbearing. This is no A’bunadh. The toastiness the presumptive Oloroso adds is wonderful and gives pleasant nuance in my preferred column of desserts.

Ian Macleod–parent company to Glengoyne, Tamdhu, the revived Rosebank, and others (and several independent bottling series) puts out a tidy line of anonymous single malts under the Macleod label representing five production regions (no Campbeltown). The series’ Island region’s delegate is naturally the Ornkey distillery not named Jura rhyming with Smiland Fark. At an unimposing $39–well below the going rate for Highland Park’s OB 12yo, this is a low-stakes gamble. But, then again, HP often does better in IB hands. Casks. Talons. Whatever.

**Nose**: Cherrywood smoke and the sweet burning gorse signature of Highland Park. Singed heather, warmed runny honey, and–interestingly–rather smokier on the whole than OB HP 12yo. A fairly unadorned representation of the HP profile here: caramel maltiness and a stack of slate, a little sour cherry and a few twists of rubber and vague metallics, but predominant heather notes with that sturdy column of smoke behind. A little bit reticent on the nose, but you get the idea of the thing.

**Taste**: Undeniably HP here too. Heather and floral aromatics are center stage. The peat remains quite sturdy here, consistent with the nose, and balances rather well the gale of heather honey.

**Mouthfeel**: Moderately thin as expected for 43%; no heat especially. Fine.

**Finish**: Finishes darkly, with milky coffee, salted caramel, and deeply cocoa truffles (sea salt atop). Roasted chicory–a lovely note–and thick Turkish delight. Tiny pinpricks of dried ginger and nutmeg duo. The finish is quite lasting, actually. Again more burnt-undergrowth smoke, chewy malt, and drizzles of honey.

**Comments**: A stellar value for this NAS independent Highland Park, and a kinder representation of my preferred  HP qualities. The more notable smoke here rather brought it into better balance than the 12yo OB. I quite liked this.

Given that the very likely candidates for all of these entrants have a fairly recognizable profile, I'm curious to what extent they will remain individually identifiable, and how well they will work together.

**Nose**: Damp slates, dust, and rained-upon ashes. Initially opened with a brash, ashy acridity I associate with Caol Ila, but that faded with time, and certainly by the second opening -- though still unmistakably Caol Ila on the nose. Many cold smokes, but with an undertone of warm honey and heather (ello, Highland Park). The HP heather grows in strength the longer it breathes. The smoke, once those sharper ashes, smoothes to more coal and burning wicks. Nice, crisp minerality to it: some juicy, cool--but not citric--fruits...melon. A dry-aged cantaloupe perhaps. Is this Jura? The integration really is decent. It's like a smokier, edgier Highland Park. Highland Park sans sweatervest, with a (twisted) neck tattoo.

**Taste**: Hugely HP out of the gate. Runny honey, heather blooms and grasses, old fires in stone circles and the faded memory of leafy green smokes. Smoke and golden syrup. It stays on the cleaner and fresher side--never beery or on the grill-spatter side of things. Meadlike, really. Can someone smoke some honey for mead? The smoke clings to the palate after initial waves of heather fruit pastries. Charred pizza crusts and caramelized wheat from high heat. A delight, really. Salted stone and beachfire remain at the fore, and the minerality (Caol Ila, I see you) is on the ascendant.

**Mouthfeel**: It's a degree thin in terms of texture, but it's really very fine. The flavors speak loudly enough, and, from what I read, the cask strength version of this blend is very youthful tasting, even if at the higher strength. No harsh alcohol bite here.

**Finish**: Medium length. Kilned hot slate, light smoke, of course, a maritime cornucopia of salted canvases, cold coals, and hints of heather honey from the slopes. The fruits are long, long gone here. Straining, I can identify a little grapeskin, tame oak, and more dock ropes.

**Comments**: This one surprised me. It's a complete delight for its price point, offers a banging combination of complexity and approachability, and, for being a blend, doesn't drown in either smoke or honey. (or suffer from nothingness) The balance was excellent between the malts, bottled at a good ABV, and isn't a hard-biting youngster. High marks from me. I even went back to clean out my shop's remaining stock.

All of Douglas Laing’s “Regional Malts” series are excellent - in my opinion, obviously - but Rock Oyster/Island is my favourite. It shows off a more ‘traditional’ style of whisky making that still prevails on the islands. The entire range is an excellent introduction to Scotch Malt, starting with Epicurean, moving on to Scallywag, then Timorous Beastie, Gauldrons, Rock Island and finishing with Big Peat. It’s the best 6 dram introduction to Scotch that I know of, and I’ve been drinking the stuff for 40 years!
Got a bottle of this when it was still called Rock Oyster. Need to review that at some point
nice surprise, i hesitate to buy one.

sure i will buy a douglas Laing, but your review will help thx :)
My tasting evaluation system aims to evaluate whiskies sampled relative to my personal enjoyment, which skews towards moderately peated, spicy, rich and nuanced whiskies with long finishes and lighter, intriguing subtleties emerging from within smoke.I liken the reviewed whisky to others that I have enjoyed approximately that much within my designated scoring bands; this may see some brow-raising comparisons of comparatively youthful expressions to longer-matured or rarer ones; it is because my scale focuses on how much I enjoyed the example drams that a 90+ score may have a reasonably pedestrian whisky rather than a quadruple-organic hand-picked Martian barley Bruichladdich expression aged 143 years in Napoleon’s autographed Yggdrasil wood cask that once held the tears of Vespasian. Enjoyment is everything.

Tasting No. 20 - 1950's Johnnie Walker Red Label - 40% ABV,,https://i.redd.it/q710g49saey91.jpg,"*Tasting No. 20 - 1950's Johnnie Walker Red Label - 40% ABV*

The second in the--trust me, short--series of quite old bottles of not-old whisky, this tasting of a 1950's Johnnie Walker Red Label follows that of its [1930's Black Label sibling](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/y8w2vq/tasting_no_16_johnnie_walker_1930s_black_label_43/) a few weeks ago. Lacking an age statement and bottled at the minimum strength even then, Red Label remains a blend of malt and grain whisky of undisclosed proportions and ages. This particular bottle, imported to the U.S., bears the warrant showing the company's appoint by Her Majesty the Queen--thus [dating it to the 1950's](https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/35959/johnnie-walker-red-label-bot1950s), and at least 1953, when Elizabeth II ascended to the throne.

**Nose**: Cereals, ethanol, and light, sweet caramel and malt candy. Wafts of indistinct perfumes, general maltiness wafting about, and plenty of wood. Oak-whacked, really. My notes here are usually long, but there's very little to say, perhaps due to time, or the underlying contents just being unremarkable olefactorily. Just a lot of somewhat harsh young grain, generic malty sweetness, and woody perfumes.

**Taste**: Better than the nose, and better than expected: not instantly harsh, but not instantly anything else, either. Quite honestly difficult to get much out of this one in terms of specific notes. It's really just a rather warming, slightly spice-affected dim glow in the mouth. Pushing for it, some edgier hints of nutmeg and stale black pepper,  overbaked shortbread and crusts, and watery fruit jelly with a sour side. Indifferent sweets, barley sugar, brioche with a boozy soak and slightly burnt bottom...brioche liqueur!

**Mouthfeel**: Not great. It's 40%, and it feels like 40%. It's hard to pick out flavors beyond the obvious. Hey, it's Red Label; I'm neither surprised nor complaining.

**Finish**: Finishes tannin-dry, with a lick of post-brioche salt.

**omments**: I feel somewhat bound by by own evaluation system here, which used--albeit contemporary--Red Label as the benchmark for the 21-50 ""Quite bad"" ranking band. This is, in fact, Red Label, and, while my heart wants it to be something More and Greater since it's as old as...well, other things from the 1950s, it's still a blended whisky with plenty of grain alcohol there that was designed to be consumed with ice, soda water, or mixers. That said, I love the experience of tasting something that's been in a bottle longer than my lifespan. It doesn't have to be quadruple-organic hand-picked Martian barley cask strength Bruichladdich to be that elusive-but-flexible word, ""interesting."" This was that.

**Mental image/faux SMWS name**: Bread Label.

**Score**: 49...kind of by definition. I should try this blind, in a flight, though.
Your rating scale is defined by modern JW Red. This is not that. If it deserves a higher score, then I think you should give it one!
What was the fill level like on this bottle before it was opened? I tried a 60s red label recently that seemed like mostly young caol ila with some grain whisky.
What tax strip went across the top?  I suspect this is early 1980s as the import label is US and the volume is in metric and UK imperial which is very late 70s to early 80s

Need advice on cleaning and valuing early 20th century Bradley and Hubbard table lamp,"There is a lot of dust built up on the glass panels. Should I leave it alone, clean with a q-tip between the metal overlay, or carefully remove and wash the glass panels? There is also some sort of white build up on the metal overlay. Is that part of the patina and I should leave it alone, or no it should come off? Is it valuable enough I should only use a professional for cleaning and if so, how do I find a good one? Located in DC area. I think everything is original and it works great, any advice on cleaning and valuing much appreciated.

Tasting No. 19 - Ardmore 11 year 2009-2021 ex-Islay Signatory Vintage - 46% ABV,,https://i.redd.it/r73fod7xdsw91.jpg,"*Tasting No. 19 - Ardmore 11 year 2009-2021 ex-Islay Signatory Vintage - 46% ABV*

**Nose**: Chalky seasmoke. Spindrift, ship's torches, salt-speckled wood. Quite Talisker, in fact - faint pepper at the edge. Ex-Lagavulin, if i had to guess. Bit simple, but nothing in there is complaint-worthy.

**Taste**:  Not Talisker anymore! Quite nice. Roasted veg with a peppery lemon vinaigrette; the capiscum family reunites...creamy, warm Urfa pepper, flint, and a nip of nutmeg-ginger spice. The flint matures to salty metals - ship's riggings, far from the sea with Ardmore somehow. Dunnage, garden loam, a pleasant shaded mossiness (Highland peat!). It takes the cask quite well - it's very Islandy in some ways that I like, but the distinctive peat comes in as smoked dried herbs, old ropes, and sackcloth. Faintest glimpse of sultana at the sweeter end, but this sticks to the drier side. Copper, but distantly. Clean dirt and back-garden stones.

**Mouthfeel**: Nice enough; not hot, and lingers long enough to get flavors without a struggle.

**Finish**: Remains unsweet, lean, but never watery. Trends more heavily towards the savory here: smoked gravies, extinguished firewood. A bothy near the woods, in new-fallen autumn. Quite lasting on the palate, with salted plants, and savory, crisp notes of root and gravel.

**Comments**: A nice introduction to Ardmore, and reinforcement of my enjoyment for Highland peat. This doesn't proclaim to be an Ardbeg et al, nor would I want it to, but I do enjoy the different pace and nuance it offers. A good effort by SV.

Good review, I like indie Ardmore's quite a bit, a good showcase of highland peat and goes really nicely with finishes.
Just bought the 2010-2021 10 yr Old version... haven't received it yet.. but hope I find it just as good..
Thanks for this review, highly appreciated your description of nose and flavor notes. I’ve picked up two bottles of this Signatory bottling and have half 3/4 in reserve in the stash. Im a peathead, still I always come back to Ardmore IBs for a malt that might not blow one’s socks off, but can still make you think. Hope you get around to reviewing the older ones sometime!

"Tasting No. 18 - Laphraoig ""Lore"" OB NAS (48% ABV)",,https://i.redd.it/iklfjnj86sw91.jpg,"*Tasting No. 18 - Laphraoig ""Lore"" OB (48% ABV)*

The last bottle in a little riverside town shop, I decided to add Lore, a well-reputed NAS made up of some good stuff, to my cabinet. A commenter on u/b1uepenguin's review of Lore helpfully shared the makeup of Lore: 65% of it is 15 year old Laphraoig along with, in unspecified proportions: 21 year old bourbon Barrel, 10 year old Oloroso (full maturation), 11 Year old Virgin European Oak, 9 Year Old Quarter Cask (Full Maturation) and 8 Year old First Fill bourbon.

Sounds busy, but hopefully the bourbon and virgin oak-matured components mean it's not completely mobbed by the sherry golems like the 2021 Cairdeas was. It being Oloroso is also promising. In we go:

**Nose**: Seaweed fires in the harbor; smoke drifting over salty old stone. Caper, camphor, and preserved lemon, followed by mines and mines of salt. Sweetens, with thick berry cordials. Raspberry leads; in fact, deadly similar to St. George's raspberry liqueur, but with a sturdy stake of smoke nailed through its heart. The smoke, initially very woodsmoke and ashy, lightens as far as haysmoke and thatch fires, but goes as dark as wet cherrywood smokes from a hot grill. Beautiful, crisp minerality, as of pinot noir. The waves of smoke pull back somewhat, just in time for the storm: rain on grey slate, spindrift.

**Taste**: Wood-fire ash, grit, and beachy smoke. Kelp fires in harborside stone henges. The salt, initially beastly, retires somewhat and remains a shier, but never gone, frame for each sip. Fires burning wet-barked wood and a subdued hue of new greenry. The oloroso is lovely here--Laphraoig takes a small amount of sherry well without getting lots; it blooms with smoked raspberries, wine-drizzled blackberry jam, empty pinot noir cask staves, and a tiny bit of fresh cherry. Sea-soaked canvas, seashells, and harbor stones are how the salt manifest later on: a stiff rime, not margarita rim. Sandalwood embers, incense, dark rubber, and more gritty ash -- the smoke is significant here. Gentle pulses of sweetness, though - cranberry cider, almost. Darkest chocolate and grill char close it out.

**Mouthfeel**: Nice - juicy, moreish. Not terribly oily, but pleasing thickness in the mouth.

**Finish**: Sand, camphor, and wood ash. Some grilled-black plums, smoked seawater. Medium in length. Tightens away from the fruit and towards a more mature tobacco and cracked leather, with just a tiny fleck of copperiness. The wood ash lingers softly.

**Comments**: That caper-camphor Laphraoig character is there, but it's subdued under a shifting cloak of subtitles that I quite like. I followed this dram with the Laphraoig 10 year CS to baseline the Laphraoig distillate character, and appreciated how the Lore both departed from yet kept faithful to that distinctive character. I quite like this.

Great review ! Would love to start doing some but i am in the process of stopping cigarette and i prefer to recover my taste/nose a bit before doing so. I grabbed a Single Malts of Scotland Caol Ila 13 Single Cask today, it really motivated me to start writing notes as it was excellent !
Great review and beautiful descriptions. Your pinot noir note hit something I've always tasted and been unable to pin down. 

Seriously, how good is this bottle? Should have bought more when I had the chance. C'est la vie.
Great review! Laphroaig is one of my fav distilleries!
Saw a bottle at my nearby liquor store for the first time for a cool price of $225 Canadian. I was tempted to pull the trigger, but I haven’t yet. I’m very happy to read your review to know it will be money well spent when the time comes.
Very well-written review! I recommend you to try adding a bit of 10CS to Lore or vice versa, it worked quite nice for me with the standard 10YO or Quarter Cask.
Laphroaig is not my favorite Islay distillery.  I'm a heretic, I know.  But I recently tried lore at a tasting and thought it was quite well put together.  A good case for an NAS whisky if ever there was one.  The Oloroso is present but not dominant.  The teenage spirit had depth and round fullness and the younger bits were lively and complimentary.
A fav of mine!

Same here. The LCBO had it for that eye-watering price and I don't think I could justify it. The Quarter Cask is pretty awesome at a much more accessible retail.
Thanks! And stellar idea. Both sound lovely and I certainly will.

A certain amount of human time units ago, [I asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/utcj6m/opinions_longrow_or_springbank_10_given_terrible/) the members of this esteemed forum whether, given terrible availability and worse pricing, I should, in their opinions, opt for purchasing a Springbank 10 or Longrow Peated. They weighed in, with many thoughtful words, but in particular the good u/dustbunna's homespun wisdom of ""Springbank 10 is good whisky. Longrow Peated is good whisky"" really sticking with me as I made this decision (he also said some things about ""silly prices"" and ""go to a bar"" and ""the price of C4 in Argentina these days,"" and ""STEAL THEIR HATS!"" but we'll skip over that here. Obviously, I made the only reasonable decision, and bought the [Longrow](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/xuzgi1/tasting_no_14_longrow_peated_nas_46_abv/).

And then I bought the Springbank.

Decision sorted.

With the giddy whirl of that introduction behind us, let's move to the actual whisky. It's the younger core expression that gem of Campbeltown, aged 10 years in a combination of sherry and ex-bourbon casks and brought, through apparently very expensive hellfire by the dread Pacific Rim Un-Importers, to my very own glencairn. Natural color, unchillfiltered.

**Nose**: A bursting basket of nearly-overripe fruits and clean packed dirt. Slate and petrichor and rained-on dust -- some real basement murk, in the best of ways. Longrow-like metallics come in: hot copper and oiled machinery, freshly turned off. Brighter notes appear, of sharper tropical fruits tucked into a creamy bavarois; crunchy, sweet pavlova on the engineering floor. Pineapple curd blobbed into a slate--very clear sharp fruit notes in abundance -- sliced apricot and unwashed grapefruit flesh. Closes out with more industrial-smoke petrichor, some freshly unearthed roots, stone dust, and storm-damp fruit-cellar doors.

**Taste**: I feel like I've had an experience already and it hasn't even been tasted yet! What a whisky. First impression: really excellent, and consistent notes with the nose. Really ticks all the boxes for me: an achievement in balance and nuance. Pineapple and orange zest roasted on a graphite grill plate, warm copper filings. Dunnage must and earth under a lovely, unique smoke: hot cordite and coal--Victorian machinery--cushioned and rounded smoothly by the subtle sherry influence that brings in faint cracked leather. Deeply reminiscent of Benromach 10 on the unique smoke, actually. Moves on to preserved lemon, mixed peel, and lime curd in a copper pot. Wonderfully, almost mechanically clean (despite the industrial and earthy tones). Soap flakes! The funk emerges from all this, and is as of a cider a day or two before it turns.

**Mouthfeel**: Lovely in the mouth; feels better than 46%. Little to no ethanol burn.

**Finish**: Pleasantly long, and deeply reminiscent of Benromach 10 still. Roasted apricot and granola baked a healthy brown. Burnt oat dust. Really, cannot emphasize how very Benromach this is to me. More 'deep' shades--dunnage, warehouse, cellar, roots, and preservation jars--but dusted now with a bit of Urfa pepper, raisiny heat--adobo, even. Burnt marshmallow over a copper scrap fire--sweet meringue inside a charred-black exterior--is quite reminiscent of a main Longrow characteristic, but lighter than the Longrow. More metallics and the passing valediction of another Longrow hallmark: thick handcream in a tin tube -- with some of the tropical fruit overtones, it approaches those old matchbox-sized containers of tutti-frutti chapstick they used to have.

**Comments**: This was the product of great craft, and utterly lovely: a marvel of balance, boasting fascinating and unique nuances, and showcasing all the hallmarks of terribly well-made whisky. In conclusion: damn it. Springbank does not disappoint.

Tasting No. 16 - Johnnie Walker 1930s Black Label (43% ABV),,https://i.redd.it/5owsc0y88yu91.jpg,"*Tasting No. 16 - Johnnie Walker 1930s Black Label (43% ABV)*  


A friend has a habit of sifting through whisky auction sites and, on occasion, landing really interesting bottles. This laudatory pasttime has yielded some today-commonplace brands that, at or nearly a century ago, were different (and indeed better) beasts, the contrast between which sampling has varied between interesting and shocking. Today's tasting, a bottle on loan from my auction-trolling friend, is the ubiquitous lower-shelf Johnnie Walker ""Black Label"" bottling -- a distinction indicating aging of at least 12 years both then and now. Research indicates that this bottle dates to the 1930's; the Illinois tax stamp and pre-metric volume on the label both affirm at least dating to the 1950's, though this bottle is a [clear match](https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/17705/johnnie-walker-black-label-bot1950s) with those of the 1930s, whereas the 1950s labels were [clearly different](https://www.oldspiritscompany.com/products/johnnie-walker-black-label-12-year-old-blended-scotch-whisky-1930s-43-75-7cl). Nonagenarian Black Label is still Black Label, however -- though, understanding that the balance of grain whisky inside this bottle may differ--as, indeed, may the quality of the malts within it, I approach this rare opportunity with open eyes.

  
**Nose**: Immediate spiritiness: floor varnish, grain, chalks. It smells like a blend, really. Not much on the nose: it's pale and washy with loads of woody varnish and alcohol notes. Eventually, a very wan caramel appears alongside the wood and a rinse of pale spices.  

**Taste**: Surprise smoke! I didn't get any of that on the nose at all, and it's very welcome. A bowl of charred lemon flesh, burning cordite, some copper parts, and sooty machinery. Coal smoke out of a 1930's steam engine. It's not terrible overall, really, but also not strictly speaking good: the smoke vanishes quickly, and is replaced by some tired, dusty raisins, hot metals, and the quite bitter clench of tannins. Weak caramel sauce watered down with young grain alcohol (the paint stripper type). Curious how little fruitiness and sweetness there is on the whole here -- none, really. Linkwood and Clynelish not present in today's volumes back in 193X?

  
**Mouthfeel**: It's predictably somewhat thin feeling, and is moderately hot. Due to the thinness, the flavor is very transitory.

  
**Finish**: Finishes with more varnishes and polioshes, now-distant soot, and the tacky acridity of burnt caramel. Quickly fades, leaving bitter pith, rinds, and stems. 
  
**Mental image/faux SMWS name**: Delay Due to Repairs on the Strathclyde Express Line

**Comments**: Fascinating to have been able to try this. It's ultimately still a lower-shelf blend, but very distinctly different from today's Black Label and I'm fortunate to have been able to compare. I'll have to do a verticale of the two at some point. The standout point for me was how different the smoke was: certainly no briny Caol Ila, the 1930s Black Label felt distinctly like old-style Highlands peat with  coalsmoke hues and industrial acridity.

  
**Score**: 61
Seems like decades of stale bottle air and to much light in a musty environment means that this dram would pare nice with a a skinny depression era stolen chicken, one wild onion, and a few moldy forgotten potatoes from a railway yard root cellar. Cook in an old tar bucket with rainwater and a rusty old  iron spike in the bottom for nutrients. …it’s the Railroad Tramp Hobo Highlife!
Great read! A bit shameful though. Always assumed the older bottlings of JW were far superior to that of the modern stuff, and I actually quite enjoy the current expressions of the black
Love that Illinois tax stamp
Awesome!
I am very tempted to buy a 1960s one at auction, do you think its worth it? I saw a few reviews that said 'No', but what you say is interesting here

Do you dislike Highland funk in general or do you think this is actually not very good whisky? I am surprised to read this review after hearing nothing but good things about the quality of Johnny Walker before the whisky boom, and having tasted the modern Black I’d describe it as a very pleasant, smooth, sweet whisky that isn’t very complex but didn’t taste “spirity” at all.
A Hemingway-style pairing.
I'm listening to Tom Waits right now and this sounds just like his lyrics.
There are definitely some really great old JW blends and  some not so great ones. Definitely a lot more variation happening in bottles that are more than a couple decades old. Most of the 50s through 70s were great. Before that, they were either great or mediocre. There's also the risk of storage and evaporation issues with very old bottles and the ""old bottle effect"". The earliest jw I've had was from the 40s and it was excellent but with the variation from batch to batch or from different markets (UK bottling vs us bottling or EU bottling) and condition of the bottle/ fill level, you never quite know what you're getting until you open it.
I’ve had a sample from a 70s bottle that was a great experience. Way more savory and complex than any current blend I’ve tried.
I think it's generally well worth the price they usually go for at auction. Some from the 60s are very good and even if you get a bottle that's not great, it's still an interesting experience. There aren't many cheaper ways to taste whisky that was distilled in the 50s
Well done - great find 

I have a 1970's Black Label sitting there... I had its twin a few years ago and am not in a big rush to repeat the experience.

This sub is on fire just now with interesting bottles!!
No, actually—I don’t mind it at all and even like Highland smoke. It was mostly a surprise to be something other than the familiar JW go-to of obvious Caol Ila/Talisker to have something very off-profile for them. 
I also expected it to be a little nice on the whole, since contemporary Black is inoffensive if a bit grainy, but this one had the batch inconsistencies of the time and the passage of time to today both working against it. It has also been open approximately one year.
If nothing else, it’ll be an experience hard to parallel. In this case, it was the “oldest” (though still 12 year) whisky I will certainly ever have, amazing bottle, and that’s still a neat experience."
Tasting No. 15 - Clynelish 14 year OB (46%),,https://i.redd.it/5575nktnwmt91.jpg,"*Tasting No. 14 - Clynelish 14 year OB (46%)*

  
The readily available OB Clynelish expression from everyone's favorite Galactic Empire beverage conglomerate, this 14 year core expression is finished in both ex-bourbon and ex-Sherry casks and bottled at a nearly respectable 46%.

  
**Nose**: Bitter warm Seville marmalade and a low-sugar Triple Sec. Aromatics waft in nicely after the fairly alcohol-heavy nosing: lavender honey, Mexican vanilla, and daubs of orange blossom water. A nearly beerish ethanolic yeastiness to it after a while, too - some sort of orange rind-steeped light German ale with a dusting of coriander. Altogether noses very bourbon to me with some of the oak coming in.

  
**Taste**: Tin cups of apple spirit and flecks of salted caramel simple syrup--a tiny fall-ish orchard cocktail with a heavily salted rim. After the salt, fainter aromatics, too: violet candies, chalky, less distinct boiled sweets, jasmine tea, and the twiggy murk-quality of oversteeped mixed herbal tea. Dodges back and forth between various vaguely savory herby aromatics, with a handful of powdery black pepper and the upper range being perfumes and arboreal colognes. A light oakiness throughout, and (here it is; I know you've been searching) stale wax birthday candles, perhaps citrus-scented candles or (old) boiled citrus sweets in wax paper. The faintest, faintest smudge of cinder in there, like the once-lit wick of the candles dropping a little pinhead of ash.   
It's curious how this manages to be both subtle and yet have more than I'd have thought going on -- it's like a tiny diorama of vivid characters, each distinct though diminutive: the orchard, fallish tones weave in and out with the lighter, citrus-y perfumed chords that are more in the floral and spring side of the spectrum.

  
**Mouthfeel**: Comes in surprisingly hot, actually, and remains so for a good while. I didn't try with water, but it may need a revisit with some later. Curiously, it was really mostly in the mouthfeel rather than particularly in the taste that the oft-spoken of waxiness emerged for me -- a slight lipid-like buildup during the swirl that was not at all unwelcome. Altogether, it creates the effect of aromatic, nougaty chews, perhaps with a bit of their wax wrapper in the mix as well.

  
**Finish**: Closes out still a little ethanolic on the palate, but fades into a vanilla-laden creaminess. The lipid quality in the mouthfeel saves it from insipidity here. Apple creme diplomat, resins and chalks, sweets in wax paper, and a glut of rooty and floral drinks: cream soda, jasmine tea, even root beer and all-natural orange soda. Medium length.  


  
**Comments**: This is fine. It does not thrill me, but is well-composed, handles the wood nicely, and has competent balance. It may be a recommendation to others, but unlikely to be a re-buy for my own cabinet.

I currently have a batch that gives me an extremely similar nose, taste, mouthfeel, and finish. I agree that, at least based on my batch, I will not be rebuying, especially given that the price seems to be creeping upward locally.  


I still do enjoy it for the combination of jasmine tea and peat that I do not seem to get anywhere else.
You beat me to it. Seconded. I love a good Clynelish and the 14 is an accessible daily dram [Oban, Arran, Springbank, Loch Lomond] this piece captures the experience really well and added to my enjoyment. I would find other things obvs, and don't mind a bit of spirity bite at the end to perk me up, but I'd struggle to be so articulate. So, cheers.
Edit: hmm, I'd add a note of slightly honeyed cinder toffee with a hint of dates, to those notes. ;)
You should. It’s quality, just not my preferred profile.
Sounds like it is my preferred profile."
Tasting No. 14 - Longrow Peated NAS - 46% ABV,,https://i.redd.it/mytunqzlfor91.jpg,"*Tasting No. 14 - Longrow Peated NAS (46%)*

  
The entry level into Longrow, Springbank's more heavily peated side, this whisky is naturally colored and un-chillfiltered.

  
**Nose**: Very promising indeed. Bacon grease on the nose - salted roasting meats with spots of char. A unique tone of hand ointment: a chalky pale sort of creamy fattiness quite unlike anything else. Fruits take over: burnt stonefruits, roasted-to-black pineapple. A bar or two of old fashioned tallow soap, tied up in wax paper and brown string. Quite lovely. Well-incorporated woodiness - more of burnt matches than anything else. A mustiness creeps in--damp tree stumps and forest floor. Some smoke of burnt almonds as well. Quite well balanced.

   
**Taste**: Prosciutto-saltiness and lightly charred bacon grease.  There are shades of Ledaig here--a high compliment indeed--but drier; this takes the presumably wholly ex-bourbon gorgeously. The barnyard 'funk' is there, I suppose, but only a teaspoon of overfermented cider not yet vinegar but lots of burbly character. Light, rubbery smoke (is that you, Bowmore!?) and yesterday's unsweet salad of tropical fruits (nothing too sharp), a dash or two of white pepper atop, and a cupful of ground-up salt-flecked seashells. The hand ointment creaminess is present in solid, resonating chords here, and it's delightfully unique. a semitone higher, and it becomes coppery (burnished pennies), and but one lower, and it would be rubber.  Steamed double cream-like lipid smoothness. There's a warmth of peppers--stale black pepper or fresh white--and hints of bright grain deep down; with all the fatty notes floating around, it becomes popcorn-infused ice cream (it's a real thing). Tail end has a dusting of turmeric, chalky creaminess of Chardonnay cask, poached pear, and more lanolin handcream--in waxed canvas perhaps.   
The smoke wavers in and out of all these lipid notes--when it intersects with the sweeter sides, it becomes deeply toasted marshmallow, charred tips of meringue kisses wrapped in waxed paper. It's the gentle smoke of freshly extinguished candles, but it's far from fleeting or faint. Razor's edge ballet of balance there.

  
**Wife note**: The dank mustiness of decomposing appleskins.

  
**Mouthfeel**: This does things at 46% I would never have expected: the fatty waxiness coats the mouth in a way I really can only liken to the actual act of eating bacon fat--moreover, an effect that is not connected with the viscosity of the whisky, which, at 46% is just fine but not oily. Nonetheless, it accomplishes with chemistry what I would have thought a much more physical mechanism's task. I bake, for special occasions, a sourdough levain boule with bits of cooked bacon throughout. The slight fermenty funk, gentle level of char, and levain-like silkiness connecting to that extraordinary fattiness of mouthfeel makes an interesting whisky analogue to that loaf. Magnificent.

  
**Finish**: Gentle, slow rolls of dead candlesmoke, blown-out marshmallow char. A windless, autumn wood below a sky set with shafts of slow, wet woodsmoke. The lanolin handcream returns, still a full tube--along with just a puff of forest campfire, that's the note that carries the finish. Quite long on waxes and handcream and unsweet meringue tips. Glass after 15 minutes has quite a lot of cider barrel and apple orchard burnpile.   
Comments: Frankly elevated my expectations of an eventual Longrow Red. Hugely surprised by what this NAS accomplishes--a real delight. A rare bottle around these parts, even with no age statement this agreed with me enough to merit the wait and pricetag.

**Score**: 93
I see you already know you'll try a Red someday, but you definitely also need to be on the lookout for a Longrow 18. If you like this a 93 that's likely going to really tickle your fancy. For perspective I rated this an 84 and the 18 - two different releases, 2018 & 2020 - 94 and 90, respectively. And until like a year ago you could get it for a little over $100 when ordering from Europe. Based on how much this inspired you to write, I'm looking forward to reading your reviews of future Longrows.
Longrow goes great with some old cheddar
This longrow is to me the benchmark for springbanks peated whiskey, but it goes up from here. Try the longrow reds, 18, and spring banks (touch of peat). The next level after that is the single casks and the from the barrel cage. Nice review!
Let me tell you something.  I bought a bottle of this approximately 1.5 years ago.  Sipped out of it for a bit and left it alone until about two weeks ago.  I've been enjoying this with a beer (the Innis and Gunn Red Ale Laphroaig Quarter Cask) as a weekly thing.  Pairs really well together.  Good stuff.
Forest floor fireplace is a pretty good description of their smoke. It’s got a cedar’y deciduous’y salty pissy soot peat smoke about it. It’s my kind of piss.
Did you read about bacon grease ahead of time or is that something you just noticed? That’s an interesting one haha
Thanks for the insight on the 18–I hadn’t, apart from generally, had it on my radar, but am thinking perhaps it ought to be up there with the Red based on your point. I suspect that my 93 for the Peated is going to prove to be outdone by subsequent tastings of Longrows, and I’ll have to curb the inflation I set off by starting (and liking) their entry level so much. The 18, for instance, will most certainly outstrip the Peated, forcing *its* score to be even higher. Predicament! Your reviews of both those strongly give me the impression they’ll be to my liking. 
Anyway, whilst keeping my eyes out for those two with enthusiasm, I still have a Kilkerran Heavily Peated to open and review. The Glen Scotia Peated 10year was interesting, but not exactly to my taste.
You know, it’s not that hard to believe. The SMWS outturn for October even features pairings with beers in celebration of Oktoberfest! I guess grain loves grain.
I like where you went with that
Way to be @ salty pissy spot. 
Cedar! Good note.
Believe it or not, that’s the profile I got on the tasting alone. That may say more about my bacon consumption than my palate, though.
Kilkerran Heavily Peated is another of my favorites, despite its youth.

I made a similar ""mistake"" with Ledaig 10; it's easy to do when it's early in the review process and you come across something that blows you away. I gave it a 94 and nearly every Ledaig I've had since I've preferred, but the scores still ended up lower than that. I'd say just try to give the most honest score indicative of how you feel about the whisky and try not to let past scoring influence your score on future Longrows, whenever that may be. Just know that your perspective shifted a bit if you are ever looking back over your scores to compare."
Tasting No. 13 - Benromach 10 year (43% ABV),,https://i.redd.it/6j0ldsgqmoq91.jpg,"*Tasting No. 13 - Benromach 10 year (43% ABV)*

**Nose**: Some lovely rich, peppery spices waft up, along with warm, rum-drizzled crepes and chocolate shavings. Some aged wood in there as well - a spicebox, perhaps with its last tenant being quite a lot of nutmeg. Creaminess from the sherry is a promising delight - it's already moreish.

**Taste**: Nice warm bite of a reconfigured-proportions mixed spice with some white and black peppers giving it a tempered peppery flare. Mellow smokiness there - blends effortlessly and fantastically in - extraordinarily well balanced, in fact, like a rare TV series with exquisite ensemble casting. The spicebox wood returns, along with a small jar of cranberry jam, some campfire-smoked Seville marmalade, and streaks of double cream over chalky milk chocolate. Really gorgeous orchestration of this all. Stays in the realm of lighter desserts - fresh figs in a torched orange caramel, spoonfuls of the brown top layer of a flan...balances lightness, richness, and complexity of spice (plus the wine & smoke handshake) wonderfully.

**Mouthfeel**: It's decent - the tiniest bit thin, if I'm being picky, but makes me look forward to the Cask Strength with this being only 43% and shining even there. Nicely coating.

**Finish**: Oak takes slight prominence over the spice in the finish - eventually. Richness and lightness dance on, though - masterful. Smoke frames the whole thing functionally: it's not the painting, it's the frame--or the canvas--something critical. Curtain drops with sticks of cassia, a fair bit of some lively jams, thick wine-y chocolate ganaches, bit of black pepper and poached pears with skin on. Port-like cocoa tannins.

**Comments**: This rightly sits on a throne of positive compliments.

**Nose**: Wow - smoked Glenfiddich, exactly. That's the instant and insuppressible first impression. Hot, smoky ciders, dingy apple butter, barely stewed cut apples. Fresher aspects too with herbs and the punchier lines of Mexican vanilla at its sweetest. Certainly takes after the bourbon cask influence. Slight char bite as from fire embers, but rich and roundly apple: smoked apple tart without much butteriness. Neat, tidy, and interesting. With a little time to breathe, some plastics emerge. Cold sugar and green apple boiled sweets. The smoke  is fascinating - it's a colder smoke with a remote artificial pungency. Let's call it a ciderhouse smoke. That first impression of smoked Glenfiddich, though -- hard to shake, and I'm just fine with that. The nose gets increasingly plasticky and acrid as time goes on, bordering on metallic - a very stiff, industrial kind of must. Thoroughly difficult call on whether or not I like that note.

  
**Taste**: Initially fairly faithful to the nose: baskets of apples and pears, harvest baskets with a tinge of  field musk to them. More clean autumn smokes. The peat comes through first as toasted oat and burnt flour--it's a decidedly unusual one: very field and orchard, both damp and dingy and also fresh and light. There is sweetness from the cask - dryly fruity -- unbaked meringues and distant drops of orchard oils. Quite a structured, tight sip. Plasticine and hot water bottle acridity emerges, mirroring the late nose. Stays lean and nearly acidic in the mouth - some fat-free apple puddings. The peat punches in now and again as a sharp dampness and harvest must: mossy field shed walls, rain-wet twigs, extinguished applewood fires. A bothy peat! Closes out with the fruit becoming less desserty: savory fruit stews, a few packets of roasted chestnuts. Finishes quite plasticky - more hot water bottles - almost coppery, as of burnished coins. 

  
**Mouthfeel**: It's fine, really. It's not luxurious and not watery at the ""integrity"" 46%. Could happily stand to be 50%, I think, though hoping that that punch up in ABV didn't accentuate the plastic notes.

  
**Finish**: Hayfield harvest fires, the bottom of apple harvesting pails, cider and embers. More plastic.

  
**Comments**: I was certainly lured in by the nose -- that smoked Glenfiddich distillate impression really caught me -- but there was some angles to this one that were unusual. This one, for me, was an exercise in how an interesting dram may not always align perfectly with my tastes, but can still be interesting--the plasticky note in particular. I don't think I'd re-buy this 10 year peated Glen Scotia, but am very far indeed from swearing off their whisky.

Tasting No. 10 - Glengoyne Cask Strength (Batch 8) - 59.2% ABV,,https://i.redd.it/lia9v9co51q91.jpg,"*Tasting No. 10 - Glengoyne Cask Strength (Batch 8) - 59.2% ABV*

Poking among the unpeated set in search of smokeless stars, I looked for moderately sweet Highlanders with high marks for integrity bottling, and not overwhelming (yet not absent) sherry influence with chocolate characteristics. Glengoyne, a Highland single malt, has the distinction of being matured in the Lowlands by virtue of the dividing line between the two happening to bisect the distillery's property in half, placing its warehouses on the Lowlands side. But fun facts don't make whisky delicious. Down (the Highland Line) we go:

**Nose**: Baking shortbread and warm nuts. Some coconut chocolates and chocolate mousse; really, quite a lot of chocolate and cream -- it's lovely. Creme pat with a good dose of vanilla bean, caramelized bananas in shortcrust, and long pulls on boozy chocolate milk -- lighter chalky maltiness, not at all soppy sweet. Minimal wood notes (a relief). The sherry increasingly asserts itself, expanding over the subtler effects with a prominent treacly stickiness, ma non troppo. Maybe a single stick of cassia bark, a handful of dates, and oat dust. Creaminess on the closeout. This is very promising indeed; I already like it baskets more than the A'Bunadh on the nose alone.

**Taste**: Fantastic. Runny honey over dried stonefruit, delightful packets of breakfasty spice...juicy and very moreish. Some salted cooked plum and grapeflesh even. Not too hot, really -- and not too sweet, either. This is really doing it for me - what a tightrope act - legend balance. A firm border of dryness keeps it out of Oversweet territory. Chocolate morello cherries, cocoa-dusted cream horn, some chocolate creme pat now, maybe with a few grains of Maldon salt. Quite pleasingly competent. The salt lingers awhile, but remains far from terribly salty.

**Mouthfeel**: Full and thick - spreads out wonderfully. Excellent strength; needs not a drop of water.

**Finish**: Fennel-pocked foccaccia, some salty roasted grapes atop. Malty chocolate character takes over...the steam from fresh cream scones with chocolate in. With mixed peel.

**Comments**: What a triumph. Terribly tasty; I think I struck gold early on in my unpeated exploration.

Nice review, thanks for sharing.  I'm curious if you or anyone else reading this has tried additional Glengoyne Cask Strength releases and can comment on how this batch compares.  I've seen some glowing praise of Glengoyne CS in recent days, and I wonder if the quality of this bottling is trending upwards.
Lovely review and photo! I'll keep an eye out for this one. Just curious, what was in the clear glass bottle?
Nice notes and review. You enjoyed this a lot more than I did. I bought this bottle primarily because I was looking for something unpeated with a combo of bourbon and sherry casks. I found it pretty ho hum and nothing pparticularly interesting or engaging. it ended up mbeing my go-to for when I wanted a whisky but didn't want to think too much about what I was drinking.
Really enjoy this stuff, nice review. 

I only recently tried it for the first time when in Aberlour & had to get a bottle immediately when I returned home.
Had a bottle of one of the older batches (I think it was batch #2), and it was great. Tasted like a liquid butterscotch cookie.
Not too complex, but very enjoyable nonetheless.
I'll definitely want to try another batch sooner or later.
I haven’t myself, but Serge has been giving batches increasingly high scores: the earlier ones were in the low 80s, with 8 coming in at 85–the highest from him in the CS series, I believe. I’ll be paying attention for 9 if I don’t get another 8 first.
Thank you. Regarding the bottle – – you know, it’s funny that you ask about it. It really is just that – a decorative bottle purchase at a home store. The powdery substance inside is the artificial cloudiness - evidently a spray on application – slowly aging, and flaking off inside the bottle. Talk about blowing mysteries, huh?
This was a neck pour; it’s quite possible that this becomes a lot less nuanced deeper down and moves more into the category you mentioned.
Haha, dang, I was hoping for a history lesson to explain how it tied into your tasting notes (maybe the powder is old chunky sea salt?)... Oh well. Looks cool anyway!"
Tasting No. 9 - Bowmore “Dark and Intense” travel exclusive NAS (40%),,https://i.redd.it/tk94a9t9fup91.jpg,"If Bowmore cut some of the BS and had a couple of 46%+ bottlings, they would probably be my favorite Islay distillery. I love their ""rubbery"" distillate character, and cask selection with their older, sherried whiskeys.
*Tasting No. 9 - Bowmore “Dark and Intense” travel exclusive 10 year (40%)*

I know, I know. OB Bowmore? A non-cask strength or even higher-proof? A *travel edition*!? Trust me, I've had these thoughts already, and the necessary self-reproach of one accustomed to such by having the misfortune of being both an enthusiastic proponent of Bowmore's distillate character and also a fervent critic of their consistent decision to kneecap it with their own bottlings.

We won't go into the Aston Martin nonsense splashed all over this bottle, because that is really is its own critique, like a questionably spelled forehead tattoo. I grabbed this one from a duty free shop because I vainly hoped that it might be either Dark or Intense--or even both. Worst case, even 40% Bowmore has more than half a chance of being not actively bad, just under-representative of its best characteristics. In we go:

**Color**: Uncomfortably fake tan copper.

**Nose**: Cardboard, prominently. A small cup of sweetened, sticky cranberry juice, strips of old-ish leather. Fresh wood dust - IKEA cask finishing, I see. Certainly some wood shavings here - it's interesting different from some rawer wood approaches, like Deanston Virgin Oak, where it screamed OAK at the top of its shrill voice. This is a quite non-bourbon woodiness: fruitwood. Really no smoke, but rather overtones of it: associations with hearth-dusty twigs and kindling paper and mugs that once held mulled wine. Not bad, especially. The papery-wood notes are surprisingly not off-putting.

**Taste**: Smoked jerky, sweet mellow waves of faint leather. These should sing, but they whisper. It is quite pleasant, actually. Some half-ream or so of archival paper, freshly riffed. Distant, yet not extinct, richness. The leather and dustiness present themselves as an old desk's writing pad. The dustiness comes more distinctly as sherry must now - it's quite distinctly Bowmore down there. Sultanas and some chalky milk chocolate: Raisinettes. The smoke fled rapidly after the initial attack - and it was soft, at that.

**Mouthfeel**: Unsurprisingly, watery. Really very thin, very little staying power - but moreish for it.

**Finish**: Bows itself offstage with remote, papery sherry notes. The smoke, weakened, retreats into more some rounded richness - not as powerful at all as the initial presentation. Wet brown paper pulp aspects to it; pleasant, still. The fresh wood holds on - still not varnishy; it wraps up dryly, but not in a tannic way. The moderate sherry-ness and faint smoke give it echoes of Benromach, but with amplified cardboard notes. 

**Comments**: Dark? Yes, but that's the coloring added talking. Intense? No; the humor of calling it that at 40% is good, though. But for all that, this is far from bad. The casks were certainly exhausted and non-influential, apart from the smack of probably fresh sherry seasoning and fresher wood, but the faint distillate character is pleasing, even if I would rearrange the dram's characteristics quite a bit on the whole. This at 46% would be a regular buy, I imagine.

NAS? It says 10 years right on the label
I must say I really like this one, even at its ABV. I think it’s good value, well, if I could find another for $60 CAD. 

The 15-Year Golden & Elegant is also good in my books… but not the 18-Year TRE (can’t remember it’s name)

*edit to add* that I really dislike the Aston Martin branding. The older label looked so much better.
Empty bottle, nice!
40% ABV…. That’s like the bare minimum

Tastings No. 7-8 'Verticale': Lagavulin 8 & Smokehead 'High Voltage' NAS,,https://i.redd.it/07wmkq67rio91.jpg,"Killer notes! That Smokehead really surprised me. It is rumoured to be either Lagavulin or Ardbeg... I personally wasn't sure.
*Tastings No. 7-8 - 'Verticale': Lagavulin 8 & Smokehead 'High Voltage' NAS* 

  
As much because these are both solid-to-solidish bottles as well as to have a platform to test-drive a pet theory about the identity of the undisclosed Islay distillery from which Ian Macleod bottles Smokehead (or at least this High Voltage bottle), I decided to taste them both. Caol Ila is firmly lodged as my default assumption for undisclosed Islays that aren't conspicuously something else, and I do love a good mystery as much as a good Islay malt. One night, I was sipping Lagavulin, while my wife had poured High Voltage. I was able to smell her glass from across the room (it's not shy on the nose), which set in motion the spindly restless wheels of conspiracy. Fully realizing that Lagavulin is a Diageo brand and that IBs from it are less than common...let's dive right in.

  
\*\*\*  
*Lagavulin 8 year - 48% ABV*  
**Nose**: Tannins afloat: Bordeaux Blanc barrel staves, a handful of wine gums. Fresh! It's a succulent crisp freshness of coriander stem, but darkens to tea leaf smoke. The smoke is clean and light--woodsmoke, not Ardbeggy grill side of the spectrum. Burnt lemon peels, Ottolenghi mad at the grill with a basket of citrus and veg. Tang of lit cigarette. Slight acridity wafts up eventually - permanent marker, some stewing pears, fruit stems and apple core. Clean dirt (oxymorons make the best tasking terms). Hot leather! Becomes mineralic - limestone, wet slates by a fire...flagstones during rain, and petrichor. I don't typically comment on color, but this is one pale dram. It looks itself quite like the white wine I first get on the nose: cheers to not dosing it with artificial tan, Diageo.   
**Taste**: ​​Starts with a dose of grill char (at least wipe down the grill between eggplants, Yotam, honestly!), though not overwhelmingly so - stays light. Sweet creeps in fairly soon, but dances on the border with savory constantly. Smoked slab bacon in thick oat porridge, crunchy burnt sourdough crusts, more white wine barrel. Some tannic bite, nothing bad. Billowing smoke, drifts close to acrid cigarette at times. A touch sweeter might be right for me - but this is still excellent.   
**Balance**: Brilliantly balanced. There is a lot going on in here, and it plays wonderfully close to the line of light and dark/heavy, maintaining nuance and not becoming overwhelmingly ashy.  
**Mouthfeel**: No complaints here. It's just right, really - 48% allows plenty of lovely nuance to shout itself hoarse. Needs nothing.  
**Finish**: Pear cordial, smoked dark-skinned apple butter. Toasty shortbread (one minute too long in the oven, so crispy corners), some baked wheat bran. Tannic teas, rainins. Never quite bitter, but treads close to metallic (not in a bad way). Boozy chocolate lava cake as the curtain drops. Lingering forest twig smoke. Lovely. The glass 15 minutes later smells again somehow of wine barrel staves - but also burnt leaves. Fresh, lively light smoke.  
**Score**: 86  
\*\*\*  
*Ian Macleod's Smokehead 'High Voltage' NAS - 58% ABV*  
**Nose**: Hot brown sugar, just-burnt caramel, mulling spice and cider. Deeply tarry wood, ashes and cinders. A second sip is sweeter, though quickly turns to salt. A lot of salt, in fact. Some mustiness, burnt cake crumbs, toasted walnut skins and nutty cake batter. Grilled apricots, even. A distinct dirtiness throughout -- earthy dirt, not clean like the Lagavulin..exhaust? It's far grillier, at least. I wonder if this is cask influence, not distillate, speaking - some ex-Ardbeg in, perhaps? Sure isn't the syrupy tones of Mr. P. Ximenez.  
**Taste**: ​​Dirty smoke - but tasty-dirty. Split logs, sticky grill char, burnt ends of a roast. It has the fullness of a steamed pudding, really - nice dessert elements with baked prune cake, sprinkles of nutmeg and, yes, sea salt. Meat fat on a chimney that hasn't had a good sweep. In a bothy. On an island. Now I'm just describing where I want to be. Storm-driven salt, salt on gravel. Salt's a bit much for me, in fact. A few panels of cardboard in there (a note I usually get with sherry influence, which this is certainly not overweight on). Surprising complexity for Smokehead being the lowbrow ""Beer me the Ardbeg marketing handbook"" strategy. Nice.  
**Balance**: It surprised me that this one wasn't too savory. Despite the heavy grill, char-blackened fat elements, this had some pleasing sweet sides to it. I don't mind a bit of salt, but it was rather too present throughout for me. Minor gripes, it was decently balanced, really.  
**Mouthfeel**: Nice. It drinks ok for 58%. A touch hot (and on other tastings, a wee bit too much so), but the mouthfeel is just right. It has a lot to say, and the ABV lets it sing. Decent, pleasingly full in the mouth.  
**Finish**: Medium in length. Some charred woods, more cake crusts and burnt offcuts, meat end bits, grill pan. Fades from grilled meats to a thinner woodsmoke. The glass 15 minutes or so later smelled of raisins soaked in tea, exhaust fumes, garden muck (that dirty aspect!), and some kind of pruney BBQ sauce slathered on burnt meat.  
**Score**: 82  
**Mental image/faux SMWS names**: (Lagavulin) Fresh peat meat heat heap; (Smokehead) Smokehead.

  
**Wrapup/Comments:**   
The Lagavulin takes it by a small margin for me, but both are solid bottles. The Smokehead is a touch more raucous, of course, but that's the objective there, and it is a smoky wundergala at 58%. The complexity the Lagavulin offers, especially in nosing, really is nice - it's a beautiful fresh, clean smoke with some fun aspects. The dirty aspect of the Smokehead isn't my favorite, but I don't hate it, either.   
**Aaaaaand?:**  
I'd swear the High Voltage is Lagavulin. God help me, I know. Maybe it's got some whacky casks (ex-Islay cask finishing could definitely alter profile meaningfully), maybe it's some divergent vatting of barrels with personality, maybe maybe maybe - but I'm more convinced it's Lagavulin despite that being improbable.
Man o Man. Your description of Laga 8 makes me want to run over to my stash and  crack open a bottle of it right now. I like it a lot more than Laga 16, but it's still behind Laga 12 and the Offerman Guinness Cask finish for me. Unfortunately, as the Guinness Cask finish is gone, gone, gone, Laga 8 has moved up to number 2 in the Laga lineup. For me, it's like a poor man's version of Laga 12, which is a very special whisky.

I've never seen the Smokehead being offered in my area, but, then again, I've never looked for it. Now I'm going to be more attentive. Thanks for your excellent reviews of both. Dare I say, whisky poetry?
I quite like Smokehead, in particular the Sherry Bomb - it’s a little more approachable than say Ardbeg Uigedal. Variety is the slice of life!
The high voltage is fantastic on a big rock. Tastes like sourdough neat - and like smoked brisket on ice. Imo.
A smoky wundergala!

Great stuff.
Just tastes the smokehead high voltage today and I was seriously impressed. I like your notes, I can fully confirm the earthy dirt in the taste. The peat is very savory and sweet, like Ardbeg and Port Charlotte and absolutely not Caol Ila or Laphroaig. Even though it's a NAS it tastes older than the Lagavullin 8 of which I'm not the biggest fan.
I think the correct expression is that ""variethy is the SPICE of life."" But perhaps you're using poetic license, and it went over my head. Or else it must be due to the dreaded spell check that doesn't work."

**Mental image/faux SMWS name**: Solution of Loki's Piss After a Cruel Night of Drinking HP 12 | 'Low Volume'

**Nose**: Inauspicious start with billows of harsh acetone, hot snappy plastic, melting Playmobile. Faintly, there's pear (hint: youth!) and something sweeter like marshmallow. Grapeskin, sultana, light flicker of pineapple juice, dusty reeds. Tired. Eventually, cheap vanilla extract and peroxide. Artificial custard essence essence, if such a thing exists. That is not a duplicated word. **6 out of 20.**

**Taste**: ​​They could rename this 'Low Volume' to contrast it with the better (still not even cask strength itself) 'Full Volume' Release. It's listening to a song you know on quiet, through a closed (vault) door. With earplugs. Clear but adulterated HP character, deep down-- the bright pops of heather and salty rocks, white-fleshed and some sharper fruits: mango and apricot flecked by blooms of seaspray; uncooked flesh of green apples with some skin. The bitter clench of acetone creeps in, too. It's almost coppery, and distinctly unpleasant. I might just be inured to peatsmoke at low, low levels these days, but I get *no* smoke influence here; it may be so faint my palate compacts it more into the Richness column than Smoke. **12 out of 45.**

**Balance**: The positive notes are so drowned by the negative or harsh ones that balance in this dram is off or absent, though not in a 'distillate-outdone-by-cask' way. **1 out of 5.**

**Mouthfeel**: Downright watery. Feels like bottom-shelf Glenfiddich in the mouth, with a generous glug of plastic factory runoff: bad alcohol applejuice. **1 out of 5.**

*Taste, Balance, & Mouthfeel*: **15 out of 55 total.**

**Finish**: Instantly harsh. Stinging oak, acetone and peroxide return and cling to the palate. None of the few virtuous aspects of the taste linger in the finish, but all the unpleasant ones do. A few minutes after the swallow, the dull echo of essential HP character is there, very weakly. **4 out of 25.**

**Value**: Oof. **1 out of 5.**

*Total score:* ***27 out of 100.*** (""Somewhere between 'yikes' and 'boinggg,'"" for those of you who get the reference.)

**Comments**: This is easily my least favorite of the HP OB lineup. Having enjoyed HP at cask strength (immensely, despite a general preference for stronger peat influence) and some IBs of it (moderately), I consider myself a proponent of the distillery and the unique, heather-blushed, all-rounder character it offers us from the Islands. That said, I did not walk into this purchase blind; I knew Magnus had the reputation of being something below the 12 in quality, and, at $50, it is certainly at least $12 less in quality less than the 12. Calling it a -$20 net loss in the name of experimentation. A score of 25 puts this...well, quite low in my rubric. I don't think that's a disservice

In some professional settings, they use the positive-negative-positive framework for feedback. For this, I submit:-You made a whisky.-Nearly everything about it was off or weak and thoroughly unrepresentative of your potential.-The whisky was in a cool black glass bottle.

\---\*\*\*---

My tasting evaluation system aims to evaluate whiskies sampled relative to my personal enjoyment, which skews towards moderately peated, spicy, rich and nuanced whiskies with long finishes and lighter, intriguing subtleties emerging from within smoke.I liken the reviewed whisky to others that I have enjoyed approximately that much within my designated scoring bands; this may see some brow-raising comparisons of comparatively youthful expressions to longer-matured or rarer ones; it is because my scale focuses on how much I enjoyed the example drams that a 90+ score may have a reasonably pedestrian whisky rather than a quadruple-organic hand-picked Martian barley Bruichladdich expression aged 143 years in Napoleon’s autographed Yggdrasil wood cask that once held the tears of Vespasian. Enjoyment is everything.I construct my overall score for the whisky from the following rubric:

Nose - 15 points possible

Taste, Mouthfeel, & Palate - 55 points possible (45 taste, 5 mouthfeel, 5 palate)

Finish - 25 points possible

Value - 5 points possible

The resultant overall score is a value between 0 and 100 that is the sum of those above categories. 

You may read the resultant score with the following commentary, modified from that of the esteemed r/thebonewolf, in mind:

0-20: Undrinkable.

21-50: This is quite bad. It’s barely drinkable neat and just tolerable mixed. (Johnnie Walker Red)

51-60: This is still bad. It’s just drinkable neat, but not by much. (Cutty Sark)

61-65: Not yet good. I would happily drink something else instead. (Johnnie Walker Black)

66-70: Strongly neutral: unimpressive, neither unpleasant nor pleasing. (Famous Grouse, Monkey Shoulder, most Chivas Regal)

71-75: Needs major changes, improvements, or tweaks for my tastes, but is on the better side of acceptable. (Johnnie Walker Double Black, Highland Park 12)

76-80: Needs changes or improvements, but is close to very good. (Johnnie Walker Green Label, Dalwhinnie 15)

81-85: Very good. Only minor tweaks could make this more suited to me. (Talisker 10, Bowmore 15)

86-90: This is great, and exceedingly close to perfectly tailored to my tastes, maybe with a single facet off or missing. (Ardbeg 10; Benromach 10)

91-95: Perfect for my tastes. (Ledaig 10; Ardbeg Uigeadail)

96+: This pushes the bounds of what I thought whisky was, is, and could be. Transcendent, utterly unique, and flawless.

"Opinions: Longrow or Springbank 10, given terrible availability and worse pricing","Both (any) Longrow and the Springbank 10 have been at the top of my list for quite some time, and I’ve not had either due to them being constantly unavailable or poorly priced. While, from reading only, it seems like the Springbank is going to be more to my taste (despite loving peat smoke) I wanted to hear voices from this community to help me decide: a local shop has the Longrow single malt 46% ($90) and another has the Springbank 10 for a (seemingly quite high) $110. I’ve wanted to try Springbank for a long time. So, for those who know: what would you do, given the cost and flavor profiles of the two? Pull the trigger on either? 
I’ve seen out of stock Springbank for a better priced $80 as well, but no guarantee that it will be restocked, or restocked at that price. 
Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/utcj6m/opinions_longrow_or_springbank_10_given_terrible/,"I'd get the Springbank, and then if you really like it go back for the Longrow.

I realize this is the opposite of the more sensible advice being given here by u/dustbunna - at the level of making a full bottle purchase they are effectively saying ""neither"" and I'm saying ""both"". 

My feeling is that in the absence of some large macro-economic event which tanks the economy we are probably stuck with the higher prices on Springbank, etc. for the foreseeable future. [insert the *Superhero with Two Buttons* meme - one labeled ""global depression"" and the other labelled ""expensive Springbank"", now excuse me while I wipe my sweaty forehead deciding which button to push]. And that there is a time to optimize one's whisky purchases focusing on value for money spent, but if you are early on in your exploration of the diversity of flavor profiles available, then optimizing for value is a goal best deferred until later - at the present time it is OK to overpay for important landmark bottlings, as the value of the knowledge you will gain by trying them outweighs the disadvantage of overpaying for a bottle. But that is just me, I place a very high premium on the value of nailing down major landmarks in the whisky flavor landscape. Others may see things differently with considerable justification.

Best of luck to you regardless of which path you take.
Springbank 10 is good whisky. Longrow Peated is good whisky. IMHO those are silly prices-- try them both at a bar sometime in the future if you want to see what they are about.
It sounds like you're basing this decision on the fear of missing out on Springbank. I've had the 15-year-old and it was very good but I don't think that it's worth the $150 to $200 a bottle that everyone else is charging. Make the decision based on some of the alternatives that you're thinking about trying. 

I'd recommend sampling a glass to make sure you're willing to pay that much for the taste. There are plenty of other alternatives.
Longrow 10 is amazing. I actually found 3 dusty bottles in a store last year for $75. So much better than the current Longrow Peated.
I don’t know about the Longrow, but after looking for quite awhile and not seeing at all, I recently sprang for a Springbank 10 for $100. I’m happy with the decision! It’s a really interesting dram and I haven’t seen it around since. You can probably find better for less, but none with quite the same character (for now, at least).
If you want to taste it bad enough, just go for it. In my opinion the price is too high for the quality, but price and quality are rarely linked when it comes to whisky. Price is related to rarity. There are plenty of $60 bottles that taste better than $150 bottles (see Ardbeg Core Range vs Special Releases). I'd like to say that we should all boycott it to bring down prices, but that will never happen. If you want to taste it bad enough to make a reddit post,  and you can afford it, just spend the money.
Springbank 10 is a good whisky. It is nowhere near worth $110. Look for Kilkerran 8 CS if you want to spend that much ($95 by me) for something in the same region.
I discovered Springbank in Edinburgh in 2004… and it has been my ‘go-to’ for almost 20 years. It’s one of the last, maybe THE last, family owned distilleries in Scotland. It’s just so dang smooth and delicious. The unavailability makes even more attractive somehow… I was super confused when I saw a bottle of Longrow with the embossed “Springbank” on it… had to try it. It was good but too peaty for my light-weight pallet.  I am anxious to try some Hazelburn from Springbank as it is known to be even softer than Springbank.  If anyone has any insight into Hazelburn… I’d love to hear it. Slàinte Mhath!
Springbank 10 for 110$? Way overpriced, like 60$ aprox here
Those prices are daft, but the Springbank 10 is at least a really great malt.  I wasn’t a fan of the Longrow I found it very metallic and lacking a lot of the nuance of other Springbank bottlings.
I'll temper my sensible (read: jaded) advice since I respect your approach here, as well: They could find one or two friends who are also excited about whisky, and go in to buy the bottles together. That mitigates some of the higher markup cost while also allowing a chance for each person to enjoy more of the whisky than a bar pour would allow.
Yes, a bottle split would be ideal here. One of the concerns I have about relying upon bar pours (or samplers) is that I've found my palate to be variable in character and to react to the same whisky differently at different times and under varying circumstances. Having a bottle (or half of one) of one's own helps with that, you get to try it multiple times, it is easier to make side by side tastings incorporating other whiskies, etc.

Cheers
How do you recommend splitting bottles? Half goes into an empty leftover?
Ideally it would nice to have an empty 375 ml, or a pair of 200 ml empties. If necessary one can get Boston Rounds in larger sizes, be sure to get the kind with plastic polycone liners inside the lid (rather than paper), see section 2.2 of this article for details:

https://whiskyanalysis.com/index.php/2019/02/28/how-best-to-store-your-whisky/

But if nothing else is readily to hand, then one can use an empty 750 or 700 ml and split them up that way. I always keep a few spare empty bottles around (with good matching corks) as insurance in case a cork breaks on one of my existing bottles, and they can also be put to use with splits.

Just be sure to label them carefully, or blind tasting may get a little bit more interesting & challenging...

Cheers!
Blinds could get REAL blind… Thanks!"
Tasting No. 5 - Aberlour A'bunadh Batch 71,,https://i.redd.it/dq6pod9io5w81.jpg,"***Aberlour A'bunadh Batch 71*** 61.5% ABV / NCA / NCF

\*\*Mental image/faux SMWS name: **A Chest of Cursed Spanish Rubies**

**Details**:  I *suspect* a hint of sherry cask maturation was involved.

**Nose**: Initially surprisingly lactic, mineral and earthy. Wine cellars; damp, with pools of soaked dark fruit. Minutes later, abrupt chocolate: chocolate-covered cherries - specifically milk chocolate. Sherry mustiness: the thick chalkiness of the sherry keeps it out of dark chocolate territory, eschewing bitterness with the plump fullness of the sherry. Heavy dessert aromas. The chalkiness becomes chocolate cheesecake, blobs of Devonshire cream over roasted-to-puddles fruit. Alcohol is fairly low to the nose. Interesting. Basement mustiness returns now, and gives way to dusty parchment. **12 out of 20.**

**Taste, Balance, & Mouthfeel:** 38 *out of 55.*

**Taste**: ​​Holy Maria, sweet madre de Jerez. Heavy syrup with cherries.  It’s a cherry gala – roundly fruity, with the warm embrace of chocolate – though it is dark chocolate now. Sherry is incredibly dominant - tiptoes towards cloying. It reminds me a lot of a thicker, oilier Stiuireadair, but without the brackishness, and with somewhat less cardboard notes. Papery notes abound. Bit like eating a manuscript with some dust in a sherry cellar. Sherry bottle labels!  Juicy, later. Overripe cranberry at its tartest, oversweet raisin at the other end. Raisinettes. This really isn’t quite to my taste, so I almost want to give it less, but it is doing what it does so well that seems cruel.  **32 out of 45.**

**Balance**: Fine. Harshness is well tapered. Overall, it’s a bit one-note, so it’s hard to evaluate it for balance of flavor when it’s like an enormous, brickhouse-chested sherry golem sitting on a teeter-totter staring intently at your 90lb frame with your little ‘expectations of balance’ sitting limply on the other side. I like (but not love) what it does, and there’s not much else to it. **2 out of 5.**

**Mouthfeel**: Shockingly easy drinker for 61%. Shocking. Drinks like 43. Beautifully thick in the mouth. Thick, coating...this is sublime. **5 out of 5.**

**Finish**: Fades out to simple but profoundly lingering sherry. Grape making its way to raisin. Few tatters of cassia and clove. Dates linger for a minute or two. *Very* long finish, though not on solely the most pleasing aspects of the taste. It’s simple, but powerfully so. Bloody hell, it just keeps *going*. I feel like my breath is exuding enough sherry influence that it could be bottled in bond. Final impression is the leather pad on an antique desk. **22 out of 25.**

**Value:** Purchased at the lowest price I have seen it in my area at $100 before tax, this is a little obscene, especially as I chose it over the Alba A'Bunadh right next to it on sale for $84. It is quality and it is cask strength, but, at least for me, I would enjoy a different dram more at this price point. I feel like I’m docking points for my taste preference here and less to do with its quality:value, but: **2 out of 5**.

**Score: 76/100.**

**Comments:** It’s nice. A little–a LOT--one faceted, but that facet is something it does quite well. Pleasingly long finish. It’s not shy about what it is. Low on complexity, balance is…oh well, not the game here. Really, it’s not higher scored for me simply because the flavor profile isn’t to my peat-preferring taste. That said, I will certainly enjoy this as a treat when I do have it.

My scoring system aims to evaluate the whiskies sampled relative to my personal enjoyment, which skews towards moderately peated, spicy, nuanced whiskies with long finishes and lighter, intriguing subtleties emerging from within smoke. I make no claim to evaluate to any standard other than my own tastes here.

I liken the reviewed whisky to others that *I have enjoyed approximately that much* within my designated scoring bands; this may see some brow-raising comparisons of comparatively youthful expressions to longer-matured or rarer ones; it is because my scale focuses on how much I enjoyed the example drams that a 90+ score may have a reasonably pedestrian whisky rather than a quadruple-organic hand-picked Martian barley Bruichladdich expression aged 143 years in Napoleon’s autographed Yggdrasil wood cask that once held the tears of Vespasian. Enjoyment is everything.

I construct my overall score for the whisky from the following rubric:

Nose - 15 points possible

Taste, Mouthfeel, & Palate - 55 points possible (45 taste, 5 mouthfeel, 5 palate)

Finish - 25 points possible

Value - 5 points possible

The resultant overall score is a value between 0 and 100 that is the sum of those above categories. You may read the resultant score with the following commentary, modified from that of the esteemed r/thebonewolf, in mind:

0-20: Undrinkable.

21-50: This is quite bad. It’s barely drinkable neat and just tolerable mixed. *(Johnnie Walker Red)*

51-60: This is still bad. It’s *just* drinkable neat. *(Cutty Sark)*

61-65: Not good. I would happily drink something else instead. *(Johnnie Walker Black)*

66-70: Strongly neutral: unimpressive, neither unpleasant nor pleasing. *(Famous Grouse, Monkey Shoulder, most Chivas Regal)*

71-75: Needs major changes, improvements, or tweaks for my tastes, but is on the better side of acceptable. *(Johnnie Walker Double Black, Glenfiddich 12)*

76-80: Needs changes or improvements, but is close to very good. *(Johnnie Walker Green Label, Dalwhinnie 15)*

81-85: Very good. Only minor tweaks could make this more suited to me. *(Talisker 10, Bowmore 15)*

86-90: This is great, and exceedingly close to perfectly tailored to my tastes, maybe with a single facet off or missing. *(Ardbeg 10, Laphroaig 10)*

91-95: Perfect for my tastes. *(Ledaig 10)*

96+: This pushes the bounds of what I thought whisky was, is, and could be. Transcendent, utterly unique, and flawless.
I have a bottle of this. I swear I loved it at first but now it tastes very harsh. I started moving half empty bottles into 350ml bottles and some even smaller ones because I suspect oxidation was the cause.
I don't usually add water to my scotch, even if it's cask strength, but I also found elements of this one a bit intense, so I tried it with a little water and holy shit did it make a difference. I insist that you try another dram with some water in it next time. I'm curious about your thoughts on it.
Good job. This batch, B71, is a good but not great batch. It follows a run of very good batches which I use as a benchmark when trying each new batch. You called it when describing the lack of ABV impact. To me, it drinks more like her older brother Aberlour 16 @ 40% ABV.
Yeah my batch 68 started out tasty but by the last quarter really lost a lot of the deep stone fruit flavours and just became astringent and bitter.
In my experience, oxidation goes the other way with scotch. Try it with a bit of water. It's the only scotch I've ever had that improved so much in my mouth from water that I won't have it straight anymore.
Fair enough. I will, and I’ll let you know.
Damn it, you were right. This one blossoms with water. Bit more bitter oak mid-finish, but on the whole it does good things.
I'm looking into buying batch 71 and came across this review. I've never added water to my whiskey - how much are you adding to open this up? Like a few drops from a pipet? Keep adding until it tastes too watered down?
I am genuinely glad to see you agree! Lots of potential in that bottle, but some of it needs to be unlocked.

I do not take my scotch drinking remotely seriously enough to measure water with a pipette. In this one, I probably go for around 2 teaspoons, but I'm totally eyeballing it from the tap on my water cooler. 

This is like a 60% abv scotch, so you'd have to throw in a shitload of water for it to start tasting watered down.
For me, it takes a very scant IKEA teaspoon well; no more or it becomes too tannic and loses mouthfeel. Everyone’s taste differs, so I’d start with a few drops and work your way up.
Thanks. Literally had no clue how much volume people add so this helps.
Thanks! Gonna pull the trigger on this batch 71 after reading about you guys liking it after adding a little water.
Sometimes I keep an ice cube tray with water only filling each block about halfway, and I’ll use one of those for my scotch."

Scalded rye-wheat field blend levain loaf (80%),,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/sot0eo,"This was a bit of an experiment I wanted to try after reading about, especially as I love low levels of rye in my sourdough bread and dislike losing my airiness and elasticity, both of which hypothetically would be improved with the scalded flour addition. 

Recipe:

600g strong bread flour

200g ww flour

100g AP flour

22g salt

800g water (750g + 50g)

230g levain

600g scalded flour paste (60g rye, 60g ww flour, 180g AP flour, 400g boiling water rested 30min)

\-------

\-Autolyse flour, 750 g water water, levain 45 min; salt with remaining 50g water plus the scalded flour paste pincered in with wet hand to incorporate scalded flour paste (took a LOT of pincering -- the paste was very thick)

\-bulk fermentation 4.5 hours at 68, coil folds every \~35 for first 3 hours (the paste required a great deal of incorporation)

\-shape -> banneton; one became a pizza, but #2 got a cold refrigerator prove for 14 hours and was baked at 450 for 25 minutes with lid and 20 without lid. As you can see in the crumb shot, much to my surprise, I underbaked it despite the appearance of the exterior. The inside was just slightly too tacky to the touch and sprung back more slowly than I'd expect. Probably will give it longer unlidded next time.

For the undercooking: don’t be afraid to bake until you see some charred bits on the top. It’s a common trait of top bread
Very interesting! I’ve only recently heard about scalding and I don’t understand it very well. I think the idea is you “pre-gelatinize” some of the starch with water+heat, so that moisture gets retained better? I’m not sure that is right though…

Any insight into how it works? Were you happy with the results? Looks like a tasty loaf to me!
That’s about my understanding as well. The research that I’ve based this particular bake on had the flour paste sit for about four hours before adding, presumably To allow for the gelatinization. As far as it went relative to previous bakes without the paste, I can’t say it was a very remarkable difference. The extensibility offered by the addition wasn’t magnitude‘s better, but may have allowed me to incorporate a higher decree of the other flours without losing openness. I would probably do it again, As the result was really quite nice tasting with that extra kick of rye that didn’t sit on the palate like cement."
Rice water?,"What would the difference be in a bread that used for at least part of its water the starchy liquid left over from soaking rice in?

Respected methodologies such as Tartine espouse dusting loaves with rice flour to finish, but I wonder what the effect of using rice soaking water as part of added water would be. 
Soaking rice removes the starchy powder that friction between rice granules during transport creates. That soaking liquid presumably leaves behind a richly starched water that one would think changes either the browning of crust, or possibly also crumb texture. 

-what would the effect of using this liquid be?
-in what quantities would an effect be seen?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/sl6blg/rice_water/,"If you can't find it online, isn't it time to ***find out***?
My guess - it would be the equivalent of adding some rice flour to your dough. How much? Just weigh a cup of this rice water and see how much more it weighs than a cup of plain water.

Rice flour doesn't absorb much water, so it shouldn't affect the effective hydration in the dough. I would guess it would just give you extra crunchy / crispy texture.
You could try it, but I don’t see how it relates to tartine dusting their loaves the rice flour. They dust with rice flour so the loaves don’t stick in the bannetons.
Chad Robertson chose rice flour (and WW mix) for dusting his banneton for a reason: presumably  properties of rice flour versus AP flour provide a better barrier against the cloth or have a nicer finish. Stands to reason that it would have an impact on crumb and texture when IN the bread, especially since the soaking may have a gelatinizing effect on the starch. Largely why I’m asking.
I don’t believe the two correlate. Rice flour prevents sticking because it’s non gluten. But I mean you could try it just to see what happens. A lot of bread recipes call for a “scald” which gelatinizes the starch, I would try the scald method over the soaking method if I were to try this. 

To scald just add your starch to 100% boiling water and let it cool down at room temp.

Personally I don’t like the texture of rice flour. It’s chalky and the mouth-feel isn’t great. But I’ve never tried gelatizing it, so who knows.

But I dust my baskets with rice flour so that I don’t destroy my high hydration loaves after their long nap in the retarder. To me, rice flour is more of a tool than an ingredient."
"Review #4 - Glenfiddich Experimental Series No. 4 ""Fire and Cane"" NAS","NAS Glenfiddich *“*Fire and Cane*” Single Malt, 43% ABV*

**Mental image/faux SMWS name:** Roasted Banana Crepe Oven Graffiti

https://preview.redd.it/ucu1ghsetnf81.jpg?width=2444&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13aec09d75681cca0aa4d0398fff086267e4fba7

Edited : **Details**: Peat influence from malting from Balvenie wedded with the naturally unpeated Glenfiddich distillate, unified in rum cask maturation matrimony.

**Nose**: Burnt brown sugar up front, with toasted citrus peels and fruit-inflected rock candy. Tropical fruit with leading banana tones. A bit of starchiness and some darker notes, like a warming-up oven. Very little whiff of alcohol. Amply evident ex-bourbon aging here on the nose -- the drying quality of oak abounds. Closes with synthetic--nearly chemical--aspects that aren't entirely pleasant; possibly a dimension of the oakiness. After some thought, I'll classify it as permanent marker tips or spray paint. **14 out of 20 points.**

**Taste, Balance, & Mouthfeel:** *36 out of 55.*

**Taste**: Oh, it’s so thin. What a disappointment. The mouthfeel was really the first thing I noticed, and it is a shame, as this could have been so interesting with greater thickness and finer pronunciation of the notes. It’s so soft, though – like listening to a song being played two rooms away. Very clearly ex-bourbon – the astringency of oak on the nose is strong on the tongue, and it stands out over the burnt-sugar notes of the rum influence. The banana creeps back here as an overtone of the burnt sugar, and the smoke is far, far more subtle than I would have thought. That stickiness of the rum is dominant: the ooze of golden syrup and the starchiness--raw batter–from the nose returns. The rum influence contributes a nice kick of molasses-y darkness that compliments the suggestion of smoke nicely. I’m strongly reminded of a Yotam Ottolenghi brunch dish: pan-caramelized bananas with a cool swirl of mascarpone cream and a crunchy rum-sugar drizzle folded into hot crepes. **31 out of 45.**

**Balance**: The balance is a little off kilter for me, which may be the addition of new make in here. It is not overly complex, and I find myself wishing the oakiness would desist and make way for a bit more burning sugar cane like I’d been hoping. **3 out of 5.**

**Mouthfeel**: Loses some points with the thinness for me. **2 out of 5.**

**Finish**: It finishes sweetly and briefly – rummy brown sugar with a whiff of permanent marker fume. **13 out of 25 points.**

**Value:** I don’t hate this pricing at $37, but will neither seek it out nor repurchase, as there are drams I enjoy more even at this price range. **3 out of 5 points**.

**Score**: 66/100. 

**Comments:** This was an interesting one to try, and, while I wish certain factors had been played up and down, respectively, it was not bad. I love the idea of their Experimental Series in general, and this was just short of being roundly pleasing, though by no means bad.

"Review #2 - Ardbeg 5 ""Wee Beastie""","*Ardbeg 5 Year “Wee Beastie”, Single Malt, 47.4% ABV*

**Mental image/faux SMWS name:** *Licking Islay’s Famous* *Electrified Cow Fence*

**Details**: Aged 5 years in ex Bourbon and Oloroso Sherry casks. Neat in a glencairn, enjoyed after resting 20 minutes.

**Color**: Yellow gold.

**Nose**: Peppery heat, lemon cleaning solution. Darkly herbal dry smoke. Ethanol-heavy. Cardstock and wet paper. Sherry sweetness, passingly. Smokiness increased the longer it sat in the glencairn. 10 out of 20 points.

**Taste, Mouthfeel, & Palate:** 44 out of 55.

**Taste**: The prickle of ‘Beastie heat immediately defines the dram. It is the distinct, rawer heat of a younger distillate, but not unpleasantly so. Starts warmly but settles down to a more *mezzo piano* crackle of alcohol that just scrapes at the back of the tongue. Interestingly, the smoke is not overpowering the palate, as  I expected from the nose. It's surprisingly moderated and not unbalanced, actually. Definitely a young Ardbeg; the distinct old leatheriness of more mature Ardbegs is there, but the adolescent version of the elder. Some of the leatheriness, possibly the Oloroso, reminded me of Bowmore on certain sips, actually. Similarly, while the signature whipcrack of Ardbeg peatsmoke rears its head, it a distinctly sharper claw than in the 10 fromthe youth, but it doesn't dominate. Past the heat, the contours of the Ardbeg 10 it would have become in another 5 years really start to emerge. I really enjoyed detecting the precursor elements to the 10 in this one -- for a 5-year, it really holds up on its own and is not a shy and retiring NAS with a puff of forgettable smoke and lots of immature distillate rawness. The leatheriness fades to charred smoky meat. Tarry, tingling black pepper closes out. 38 out of 45.

**Palate**: The alcohol heat isn’t deterring here, being part of the effect this bottle is advertising. The heat comes from the youth, not overmuch the ABV. There is a certain pyrotechnic quality to a sip, though. 3 out of 5.

**Mouthfeel**: Thinner in the mouth than I’d have thought given the tiny extra kick of ABV. It’s fine; 3 out of 5.

**Finish**: The smoky leather sticks around for a while pleasantly, but the finish is muted and not overly noteworthy. 13 out of 25 points.

**Value:** I picked this up for $39 on a (minor) sale from its typical $45-$50 pricetag. It was an interesting dram, and like others here I am thrilled Ardbeg was content to not make this a NAS in the name of transparency and standing up for their product, even at a young age. However, the proximity of Beastie’s pricing to its core 10-year expression, which I quite enjoy, is off-putting to me. I find the 10 to be rather good in value at about $55 at my shop; the NAS An Oa, around $45, is similarly perplexingly close to the 10 in price. I’m torn on value, as I enjoyed Wee Beastie but found it inferior to the 10 for being just $10 or so less than it. That said, I don’t see how it could feasibly be priced much *lower* than $45, where it would effectively be shelfmates with..what, bad blends?. **3 out of 5 points** for value, but I might have just persuaded myself that the 10 needs to be more expensive?

**Score**: 72/100

**Comments**: I know, what? 72? Why the horsepiss score? I myself had a hard time reconciling how much I enjoyed this with where my aggregate score landed this bottle on my own scale. That said, I decided to stick with it rather than artificially inflate my ratings of its characteristics for the reason that this bottle does not pretend to be something it is not. I enjoy Ardbeg’s 10 more than Wee Beastie, and its score will reflect that (when I get around to writing it up); as a result, this expression, while good, I felt should remain characterized in score relative what it was: a fun, younger dram marketed as such with deficiencies that are only ‘deficient’ when compared with other, different/older whisky.

**Edit**: Having subsequently removed my rather over-confining per-category points allocation, I revise this score to 82.

My scoring system aims to evaluate the whiskies sampled relative to my personal enjoyment, which skews towards moderately peated, spicy, nuanced whiskies with long finishes and lighter, intriguing subtleties emerging from within smoke. I make no claim to evaluate to any standard other than my own tastes here.

I liken the reviewed whisky to others that *I have enjoyed approximately that much* within my designated scoring bands; this may see some brow-raising comparisons of comparatively youthful expressions to longer-matured or rarer ones; it is because my scale focuses on how much I enjoyed the example drams that a 90+ score may have a reasonably pedestrian whisky rather than a quadruple-organic hand-picked barley Bruichladdich expression aged 43 years in a Yggdrasil wood cask that once held the tears of Vespasian. Enjoyment is everything.

I construct my overall score for the whisky from the following rubric:

Nose - 15 points possible

Taste, Mouthfeel, & Palate - 55 points possible (45 taste, 5 mouthfeel, 5 palate)

Finish - 25 points possible

Value - 5 points possible

The resultant overall score is a value between 0 and 100 that is the sum of those above categories. You may read the resultant score with the following commentary, modified from that of the esteemed r/thebonewolf, in mind:

0-20: Undrinkable.

21-50: This is quite bad. It’s barely drinkable neat and just tolerable mixed. *(Johnnie Walker Red)*

51-60: This is still bad. It’s *just* drinkable neat. *(Cutty Sark)*

61-65: Not good. Given the chance, I would happily drink something else instead. *(Johnnie Walker Black)*

66-70: Strongly neutral: neither unpleasant nor pleasing. *(Famous Grouse, Monkey Shoulder, most Chivas Regal)*

71-75: Needs major changes, improvements, or tweaks for my tastes, but is on the better side of acceptable. *(Johnnie Walker Double Black, Glenlivet 12)*

76-80: Needs changes or improvements, but is close to very good. *(Johnnie Walker Green Label, Dalwhinnie 15)*

81-85: Very good. Only minor tweaks could make this more suited to me. *(Oban 14, Bowmore 15)*

86-90: This is great, and exceedingly close to perfectly tailored to my tastes, maybe with a single facet off or missing. *(Ardbeg 10)*

91-95: Perfect for my tastes. *(Ledaig 10)*

96+: This pushes the bounds of what I thought whisky was, is, and could be. Transcendent, utterly unique, and flawless.

*Talisker Storm, Single Malt, 45.8% ABV*

**Mental image/faux SMWS name:** A Mediterranean seafood feast grilled over coals beside the sea, after a dusk storm

**Details**: Diageoly not disclosed; most certainly chill-filtered and artificially colored.

**Color**: Burnished, [1.1](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/567c305ab204d52319a4d09b/1452365837106-31SBM8VT75DCUYPVB2RG/?format=1000w&content-type=image%2Fjpeg).

**Nose**: Salt, fresh sea air. Lemon oil, warm honey, woodsmoke. Heather blooms, faintly and waxily. Bit of burn on the nose, but not off-putting. 16 out of 20 points.

**Overall Taste, Mouthfeel, & Palate:** 42 out of 55.

**Taste**: Blowtorch-charred, caramelized lemon flesh and melted dark honey surge up, to be overtaken by sweet maltiness. The Talisker glint of Skye maritime brine emerges, mouth-watering and very appealing. Short twist of citrus again and then distant but not dismissable smoke rolls in, melding into a smoked sea-salt caramel. Closes out with a wonderfully warming chile-pepper-smoky adobo heat - like the cayenne in certain chile-infused chocolate bars - melty but not syrupy, invigorating, spreading crimson warmth. 39 out of 45.

**Palate**: At just over 45%, this was not terribly hot in the mouth or to swallow. 3 out of 5.

**Mouthfeel**: A bit thin; not very mouth-coating. Not bad. 3 out of 5.

**Finish**: Almost! Augh, it was so close. The salted caramel rolls back in rich daubs in the finish, with a little puff of the delicious blowtorched peel and woodsmoke returning, but regrettably, the final act of the finish was a jarring and unpleasant bitterness - lemon pith, celery leaves, raw green oak. Had the finish ended just before that bitter bite and it would have been better, because what lingers on is that bitterness rather than the very pleasant preceding richness. 17 out of 25 points.

**Value:** Though there has been much fluttering and flapping on r/Scotch about Storm being overpriced at anything over $30 (or less!), I thoroughly enjoyed it at even $50 and don’t regret spending that. I do wish it was cheaper, as the Talisker 10 was only another $10 more expensive at my local shop, but here we are. While I’d prefer Storm was closer to $35-40 given it being NAS and with that green finish, I suspect myself of being slightly greedy at that given how much I enjoyed this overall. 4 out of 5 points for value.

**Score**: 80/100

New favorite adverb. Funnily enough, I was going to comment on how similar our scales are before I noticed the mention. Nice first review, an entertaining read, keep it up!
Great review, and Talisker Storm is one of my favorite bottles.
Have worked my way back here from Clynelish. Thoroughly enjoying your notes and scoring system. Going to start tasting along. It's good to be able to join in instead of the frustration of overpriced or unobtainable/sold out whiskies. My slightly jaded palate has come full circle back to appreciating more value in the standard releases. (with quite a few exceptions!)

Have made some good blends using Storm, time to start up again. Try eg with Ben Nevis, in any ratio. Cheers."
