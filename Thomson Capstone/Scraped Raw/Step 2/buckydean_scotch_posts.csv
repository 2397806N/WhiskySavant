"Review #843: Cardinat 2003 19yr, 51.5%",,https://i.redd.it/jyvifcpxflqc1.jpeg,"I am reviewing all five Cardinat Armagnac bottlings that recetly arrived at K&L Wine. This is review #2 of 5. This one is available for $75.

Brandy review #173

***************

**Cardinat 2003 19yr #131, 51.5%**

**Nose:** Hot cinnamon cherry, brash toasted wood, caramel, big hot spice, tannic wood, some grape under all the spice. 

**Taste:** Brash toasted wood, hot cinnamon and cherry, spice heat, light candy grape and caramel, bitter wood, almost nutty, floral notes. Nose doesn't lie this drinks hot and sweet. Feels unbalanced, not enough oak or fruits to overcome the heat

**Finish:** Toasted wood, caramel, hot spice, cinnamon, hot cherry. Some richer caramel wood notes on the finish save this a bit

************

Not enjoying this one. It's pretty hot for only being 51%, there's some nice caramel and fruits but the flavor feels a little washed out. Not enough richness to overcome the spice heat. I liked the 2007 better that I had before this. Like that one, this is a lighter wood profile(for an Armagnac) compared to past Cardinat releases and reminds me more of a Bourbon type of wood style. Hot and sweet and brash

Brandy review #172

******************

**Cardinat 2007 15yr #187, 54.5%**

**Nose:** Caramel, sweet toasted oak, honey graham cracker, tannic wood, vanilla, grape, tingly menthol spice

**Taste:** Hot cherry, sweet candy grape, caramel, honeyed floral notes, spice heat, antique wood, sweetly toasted oak, vanilla. Spicey and sweet but not overly hot.

**Finish:** Hot cherry and grape, sweet caramel, toasted wood, sweet florals, mellow spice

***************

I'm used to past Cardinat releases being much more dark and chocolatey than this, even at a young age. My 2005 14yr is all chocolatey oak and heavy vanilla with bolder fruits than this. This one is more thick caramel, brash wood, sweet floral notes and fruits, and lively spice heat that mostly stays under control. Might be good if you are looking for a more Bourbon-y experience. It's good stuff but not the kind of profile I usually look for in yak.

My brothers wedding is coming up and his birth year is 90, so I look forward to your 90 review to see if it's something he'd like!
Nice review! I'm jealous. I was in San Francisco last November and picked up a bottle of the 1988. I've had it open for a couple of months now and I really like it. I wish I could pick up another bottle and try other bottles from them. I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the series!"

Scotch review #332

*******************

**Dailuaine 1997 24yr ""Signatory Cask Strength,"" hogsheads 50.5%**

**Nose:** Big waxy malt and clean cereal grain, sharp green apple, golden caramel, toasted wood with a slight tannic edge, tropical fruits, light wood spice

**Taste:** Clean sweet barley, oily and malty mouthfeel, big green apple, mango and tropical fruits, sugary dessert pastry, thick and bready and sweet but also some richer caramel and toasted wood giving it just a touch of darker woody heft. Great thick mouthfeel  

**Finish:** Caramel and thick waxy malt, sugary barley, sweet toasted wood, some vanilla. A thick waxy and malty finish with some gritty barrel notes

*************

I'm a big fan of this distillery and this is another great one. Their malt character is so amazing, it's big barley that is thick and waxy and clean. And it does well here with a bit more wood. My [previous Signatory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/uk4mwe/review_687_dailuaine_1997_23_year_signatory/) was also a 1997 but a much lighter refill type of cask resulting in a buttery and desserty malt-forward Scotch. All that waxy malt character is found here but with more gritty caramel and wood, and just a hint of tannic edge. I prefer a bit less wood in a Scotch like this though, let the malt shine I say. But that's more of a personal preference. No real complaints here. 

As a sidenote, I've had great results with Signatory doing these multi-cask bottlings(as opposed to a single cask). It results in some very well-balanced Scotch that smooths out the edges a single cask can sometimes have. I'm guessing from the quality that these multi-cask blends are better than their individual components are on their own, or else why go to the trouble? If you can get over the romantic ideal of a single cask I think it's a great idea.

Score :**8/10**
This sounds so so up my alley. I‚Äôm curious where you found this!?
I love the review,  and the bottle.  I have a very similar SV cask strength Dailuaine, mine being a 1998 20 year old from hogsheads. It's like a different take on a clynelish,  which is a compliment for me.  Citrus and wax, syrupy and tangy,   very clean like yours.  Love this distillery! Cheers
Great review! This sort of age and maturation really is peak Dailuaine, big oily distillate and bags of fruit. Glad to hear it was good, if a little wood heavy. I have a similar bottling (20yo, ex-bourbs, 50%) that plays out in the same way
Signatory (their Cask Strength Collection in particular) is just phenomenal at releasing bottlings like this.
Plus naturally fruity malt. Exactly what I hunt for
I bought this one on Whizita.de a while back"
"Review #840: ""Russell's Reserve Single Barrel"" Mission Wine pick #23-0213, 55%",,https://i.redd.it/7l9j03lfo3qc1.jpeg,"Picked by Mission Wine in Southern California, purchased for $70

American Whiskey review #301

**************** 

**""Russell's Reserve Single Barrel"" Mission Wine pick #23-0213, 55%**

**Nose:** Thick caramel, honey graham cracker, smooth Wild Turkey corn with a hint of musty Turkey funk, brown sugar, lots of vanilla, cherry candy fruits, sweet toasted wood, gentle cinnamon and baking spices. Delicious and so dang inviting, I want to crawl into this glass and live here

**Taste:** Thick caramel and brown sugar with lots of vanilla hits big in a sweet and satisfying way, baking spice, sweet corn with just enough of that smooth Wild Turkey funk, smooth sweet toasted wood, caramel dipped cherry. Rich flavor, silky smooth and effortlessly balanced, thick oily mouthfeel, ridiculously drinkable and satisfying

**Finish:** Vanilla and caramel with building sweet red fruits, lightly tingling baking spice, smooth sweet toasted wood. No surprises here at all, the sweet satisfying flavor just keeps on coming into the finish

************************

Just wow. This is an incredible barrel. Leans on the sweeter side with lots of rich caramel, vanilla and candy fruits, but it stays extremely well-rounded overall with plenty of vanilla and wood. It has that quality that I absolutely love in Wild Turkey Bourbon where the flavor just flows in an effortless kind of way. It feels like an expertly crafted finished product with no rough edges, not like a fiery single barrel at all. This is exactly the kind of experience I look for in a Wild Turkey barrel and I couldn't be happier with it.

Score: **9/10**
I keep a bottle in my cabinet all of the time  of both the 10 year and the single barrel. 
I just can't find a fault with any of the Russell's I have tried.
I love those TY-K bottles.
Great review! Mission gets so many picks it‚Äôs hard to know which ones to get.
Next time I‚Äôm in SoCal I‚Äôll have to grab one of these.¬†
I'd rather have a good RR SiB than any other bourbon I've tried, including GTS, C923, any Booker's, and so on. They're just so complex.
I need this. üòÅ
Their SiB program has been firing on all cylinders again since late 2022. I think they have the new still officially broken in. It‚Äôs regrettable that we still get pretty mediocre 101 batches right now though. I have not had an underwhelming RR pick in probably 2 years now.
with all of the unicorns out there, I love seeing a RR SiB score this high. great review
Last week I was in Pasadena by chance and picked this up from Mission Liquor, and also the one bottled 8/14/23. Absolutely mind blowing bottle. They‚Äôre both great and basically identical. The flavors are just so intense in all the best ways. I can‚Äôt believe these are just a hair under 9 years.
I have a TY-K ready to go as soon as I finish my Camp Nelson F pick from a couple of years ago.  That one is fantastic; seeing a strong review on a TY-K makes me not so sad about my current bottle being almost gone.
Yeah, there's certainly a tendency to save higher scores for those special bottles. I'm guilty of it too. But this is the kind of Bourbon that is such a pleasure to sip on that there is just no denying the quality."

Brandy review #171

********************

**""Through the Grapevine"" Vaudon 1996, 50.3%**

**Nose:** Rich flowing caramel, flowery honey, orange marmalade, aromatic Cognac woodiness, sandalwood, sweet tart grape, apricot, tropical fruits, drying wood spice, sweet floral notes. So pleasant and fruity

**Taste:** Caramel, honey with building sweet floral notes and rich fruits, orange, drying Cognac woodiness and aromatic wood spice, bright sweet tropical fruits, apricot, honeyed and rich caramel-covered white fruits, lightly toasted vanilla. It's sweet and almost bright except for the smooth Cognac woodiness and a nice caramel richness coating it all

**Finish:** Drying toasted wood, vanilla, caramel, sweet floral and bright tropical fruits build big and sweet with aromatic wood spice carries on a long time 

************

Just an all-around great and drinkable Cognac. It's sweet and fruity but has tons of rich caramel and just the right amount of drying Cognac woodiness to keep it well-rounded. It's big and full flavored and never feels too delicate or too hot. Hits just right. Love this stuff

**Seailles 1999 #20, 51%**

**Nose:** Thick caramel, charred wood, mint, smooth tannins, tobacco, vanilla, wood spice, grape.

**Taste:** Charred toasted wood, wood spice, thick caramel, drying tannins, tobacco, sweet vanilla, woody cherry, fruity grape.

**Finish:** Brash toasted wood, vanilla, drying tannins, sweet cherry, nice little spice kick, lingering wood spice and tannins

***********

Has a bourbon kind of oakiness that stays well under control. Lots of wood spice and tobacco type notes that you don't usually get in an Armagnac, but plenty of thick caramel and fruits to balance it out. It's a little hot but nothing out of control. More of a sweet bourbon-y spice kick. The fruits and thicker Armagnac oak notes come through so you know it's a brandy, keeps it from feeling too much like a Bourbon. Good stuff

"Review #837: Marquestau 1994, 46.4%",,https://i.redd.it/cat0vyu6d9lc1.jpeg,"Became available on FineDrams last year which would make it about 29 years old, but there's no age statement on the bottle. Currently available there for about $90

Brandy review #169

****************

**Marquestau 1994, 46.4%**

**Nose:**Dank dark toasted oak, fudgy chocolate, wet wood, heavy vanilla, raspberry, strawberry, candy grape. It's so dank and dark but sweet fruits at the same time, you just want to live here

**Taste:** Thick dark oak, smooth and chocolatey toasted, heavy vanilla, but also light drying tannins, mint, chocolate covered cherry, fruity grape still has a nice sweet presence through all the darkness, tobacco. So smooth and thick, the flavor builds and flows and settles effortlessly

**Finish:**Smooth dark toasted wood, mint, still tons of vanilla, trails off into some drying dark oak and mild wood spice

********************

This is fantastic. Marquestau just delivers. On the darker and woodier side for sure but it does it in such a ridiculously smooth and drinkable way. So much dark chocolatey oak and heavy vanilla but still lots of sweet fruit, and just enough drying oak to give it that sense of age. And all effortlessly balanced together. Just beautiful. This packs so much thick flavor into 46% but still has all the drinkability you would expect from that strength. Can't say enough good things about this one if you like them dark.

Score: **9/10**
I‚Äôm curious how this compares with Leberon or d‚ÄôAurensan if you‚Äôve had those?
Thanks!

Are you sure it isn't 44,5%?

https://www.finedrams.com/marquestau-1994-bas-armagnac.html
Haven't had leberon. D'Aurensan is a darker profile too but what I tried had a lot of soy sauce rancio. Marquestau is much more accessible, just some light tannins and no real rancio. Heavier on smooth chocolatey oak and vanilla. More similar to Charron
Yeah, 46.4% is the ABV written on my bottle. The ABV on these Marquestaus is a whole issue from the domaine itself. A bunch got inaccurately labeled as 44.5% apparently. The consensus seems to be that when you see a different ABV, that is the correct one and a bunch just got bad 44.5% labels.

EDIT: apparently this isn't actually known for sure, it's just speculation. See my other comment
I need to edit my previous reply. I just found out that this is actually just speculation. For sure there are multiple abv's of the same vintages, but no one knows for sure yet if they are different bottlings or just wrong labels. I guess there's been other factors that leads some to believe they might be wrong labels. But until someone side-by-sides or tests them we don't know for sure.
Yeah the rich oak you were talking about sounds similar to but is very different from the forest floor/soy sauce rancio in d‚ÄôAurensan. 

Helpful context, thanks!"
"Review #836: Kilkerran heavily peated ""Peat in Progress"" batch 2, 60.9%",,https://i.redd.it/zeihrf3gp8lc1.jpeg,"This batch is several years old, it looks like they are on at least batch 9 now. According to Whiskybase this is 55% Bourbon barrel and 45% ex-sherry. Not sure what this batch sold for but newer ones are about $100.

Scotch review #331

*******************

**Kilkerran heavily peated ""Peat in Progress"" batch 2, 60.9%**

**Nose:** Yep, that is a peat monster all right. Huge lumbering peat, tar, lemon, caramel and light wine funk, ashy char, funky new make spirit, spice, quite hot 

**Taste:** Thick mean peat, huge and oily on the palate, vanilla custard, lemon, funky and sweet new make spirit, caramel, gritty char and spice. It's very hot, has some funky youthful notes, but it's not a mess and there's some nice flavor. 

**Finish:** Huge powerful peat and lots of peppery spice, bright lemon, tar, vanilla

*****************

This is definitely a peat monster as the name implies. Right up there with Islay levels. It's a mean and powerful peat, very straightforward, probably most similar to a Caol Ila. It's a bit too hot and youthful tasting but basically pulls it off well. Lots of youthful bourbon barrel type notes, not much sherry here. But it might just be getting overpowered by all the peat and spice. Based on the quality here and what I know about Kilkerran, this could shape up to be some great some stuff with more age on it. So maybe the newer batches have come along better. The mouthfeel is especially impressive, if the flavor came together better it would be massive. But this one is just too young and hot. Interesting snapshot of the progress though if that's what it is meant to show. 

Score: **6/10**
I‚Äôd do disgusting things to get a bottle of this. 

Is your review based on a freshly opened bottle? Because this range needs a fair amount of oxygen and headspace to really come into its own.

Thanks for letting me enjoy it vicariously ü•É
I got my bottle for approx $80 and had no idea what I was getting into. I got layers and layers of brine and caramel with some Campbeltown funk. It does drink very hot, but in the best way possible- it literally sucked the breath out of my lungs. What an absolute gem of a bottle. To me it tastes like eating Davy Jones lost stash of caramels from the Flying Dutchman recovered from the bottom of the ocean.
From batches 4-7 I can term that it's desperate for oxidising (split the bottle into halves and wait months), but it's totally worth the patience.
Happy to hear some reports about the latest batch needing less oxidisation.
Fantastic release
I have batch 9 and I love it so much I ordered another one. It's got this nice subtle sweetness behind the peat and doesn't really drink that hot. Really fantastic stuff!
I'm curious as how this compares to Corryvreckan.

I do love ashy and peppery peats like that.

If I ever see any of these by me available for ordering, I'll try and pick one up.
I had a bottle of this release about two years ago and my notes would be pretty similar to yours. Peat initially, perhaps more earthy than smoky, a ripple of caramel and baked desserts, but some distracting youthful characteristics which present as a bit of heat with a tequila note and a roasted vegetable note‚Äîbut the vegetables had been in the fridge a week too long and you‚Äôre not sure if you should eat them. I agree that there‚Äôs very little noticeable sherry cask here‚Äîif it‚Äôs 45% it must have been refill casks. People keep telling you that you should give this one some air‚Äîand Springbank products do benefit from air more than other distilleries in my experience‚Äîbut I had this bottle open for about three months and never really looked forward to drinking it.
It's from a small 2oz sample bottle that I've had since probably 2020 or 2021. Don't know the fill level of the bottle it was poured from, but I would guess it had already been open a while. And I let the sample breathe for a good amount of time.

If you could find a newer batch at all, I'm guessing it would be quite a bit better than this. Kilkerran is a great distillery and I would think they have improved on this bottle with more age/time
The latest (batch 9) is fantastic. A must have if anyone remotely likes this release, they really have the salty/sweet balance dialed in
Yes batch 9 is wonderful stuff, although it's pretty hot freshly cracked - had one dram then I set it aside for a few months to settle down (which it did quite nicely).

Also picked up the brand new, 2024 8 yr 57.4% CS last week - this year it's been aged in sherry casks, rather than bourbon like 2023. Same thing as Heavily Peated batch 9, had a dram when I cracked it open but the bottle is now going to rest till probably June or July... Early indications from that first dram are it's an absolute cracker (admittedly I've always been partial to sherry casks).
I had the opposite experience you did, I‚Äôve found all previous batches hot and needed a couple months of being open with a few oz missing to really come alive. Batches 4&6 were standouts to me. Batch 9 was the first one of this series that I felt was ready to go right away. 

I‚Äôll have to keep my eyes peeled and be quick to grab the 8yo!"

**Finish:** Sweet dark fruits keep building, big toasted oak, thick caramel, smooth spice 

*****************************************

These are both amazing, and excellent examples of everything I love about Le Freche. Dark and charred and oaky but at the same time just exploding with concentrated syrupy fruits. The nose on #22 easily blows away #45, it's bolder and more concentrated with #45 feeling a bit musty and weak in comparison. I thought I would have a clear winner based on that alone. But then on the palate #45 really comes alive, bigger fruits and richer caramel to compliment all the dark oak. #22 is so dark and concentrated that it almost feels muted in comparison. But in the end that darkness on #22 really comes together well, and I think it wins with bigger flavor and longer finish. Love the big fruit on #45 a lot though. I would be thrilled to own either one of these, truly. What a treat to do these side by side

**Dailuaine 2009 9yr ""Old Malt Cask"" Bourbon barrel, 50%**

**Nose:** Big sweet barley, lemon cake, hay, light green apple, sweet flowery honey, sugar pastry. I can already tell this is a great barley-forward Scotch

**Taste:** Big pop of sweet sugary barley, hay, Nilla wafers, vanilla icing, sugar pastry, sweet flowery honey, easy tropical fruits. Beautiful oily mouthfeel with flavor that all flows effortlessly. Ridiculously approachable and sweet and malty, so damn drinkable

**Finish:** No surprises, the flavor carries on right into the finish. Sweet sugary barley, soft building spice, lemon citrus, sweet malty goodness 

**************

Dailuaine is one of my favorite malty Scotches and this is a perfect example of why. Everything about this is pleasant and delicious. Big sweet barley, sugary dessert notes, easygoing fruits, all effortlessly balanced. This drinks way older than 9 years old it's ridiculous. As usual Dailuaine shines with a very light barrel influence so the malt can really shine. I do feel that this suffers from being brought down to 50%, it could be just a little thicker and more oily based on my usual experience with this Distillery. But ""suffers"" is a strong word, really that just means it's been brought down from perfect to damn near perfect.

Delicious stuff. Everything about it is sweet but in a creamy and burnt caramelized kind of way, and lots of beautiful toasted oak. Creamy toffee and a nice thick mouthfeel levels it all out. I'm a big fan of wheated Bourbons so I was intrigued by an (almost) 100% Wheat Whiskey with some serious age on it. And it's pretty much everything I could have hoped for. Showcases the creamy-sweet wheat grain and has plenty of well-aged oakiness without going too far in any one direction. Killer barrel

Score: **8/10**
Fantastic review. This was my first bottle of Old Elk, and it‚Äôs a damn fine dram.  Completely agree on the toasted oak/caramel. I get a lot of creme br√ªl√©e on it as well. Wish I could find more of this.
Love old elk. Sipping on their port cask finish currently, would highly recommend it
I purchased a bottle of the 10 year and it was excellent. I'm not a big wheat fan, but the Old Elk Wheat Whiskey was just what the sweet tooth ordered.
I got this for my friend and he crushed it in a week. I didn't even get a chance to taste it!
I am absolutely furious with myself for not learning how to join the Reddit picks until after almost all of the old elk picks. I‚Äôd snatch up every one 100%. The 8 year wheated bourbon has dominated every weller FP friends have brought over for comparison.
I got a Old Elk barrel pick through a local beer club. Unquestionably and by a large margin, the tastiest bottle of whiskey I've ever had.  It was creme brulee in a glass.  I loved it so much, I asked Greg Metze to sign my empty. Im still chasing another like it - it sounds like this was pretty close to it.

**Finish:** Bright sugary fruits, sweet toasted wood, caramel, black licorice char, easy spice

*************

Delicious stuff, lots of smooth oak and lots of sweet sugary fruit. Has a hefty funk to it that is making me lean towards rum. But it's all very well-balanced. Really thick and full-flavored mouthfeel. It's making me think it has some age on it, because it's oaky but in a smooth and well integrated way. I would think something younger would be oaky in a more brash way from short aging in a hot climate. These are wild guesses because I don't know much about rum. Assuming it even is rum and I'm not just embarrassing myself here. Not too hot either, maybe 50-55%

**8/10**

**Post-Reveal Thoughts:** Wow I feel pretty good about my guess. I'm not even sure what I meant by ""having age on it"" but 13yr sounds right. That is probably decent for a rum. I'm not usually a big fan of aged rum but I'm digging this. That funk is lingering, it's really good. I'm loving all the caramel and chocolate type notes it has, just a very warm and inviting oak. I love the balance of sweet fruits and funk and warm chocolatey oak.
Love the finish on this one, goes on and on!"

*****************

**""Bernheim Wheat Whiskey"" Barrel Proof B923, 60.2%**

**Nose:** Thick caramel, nutty and bready, brown sugar, green apple, sweet toasted wood, lots of vanilla, mellow herbal spice. Delicious and super inviting 

**Taste:** Toasted wood, sweet and bready, thick caramel, woody cherry, brown sugars, vanilla, slight wood must, herbal spice and light cinnamon. It really pops with some nice sweetness but still lots of richer caramel and toasted notes. Friendly zingy spice. Very well-balanced, just delicious

**Finish:** Bright pop of cherry, corn and sweet spice before settling into creamy caramel, sweet toasted wood, vanilla, mild tannins  

*************

Wow this stuff is delicious. This is my first experience with Bernheim and I love it. Don't know if this is a special batch, or if it's always this good or what. Lots of sweetness but it's not an overload, it still feels well-aged with plenty of darker toasted wood and vanilla notes, and a nice thick caramel-y mouthfeel. Big flavor but stays friendly, not too brash or spicy. It all balances together nicely. Fun and enjoyable and unique

Score: **8/10**
I liked mine. Think I would have rated a 6 or 7.
I‚Äôm in FLA and keep trying to find a bottle of this. I generally love Wheated and this review gives me a bit of FOMO, but I know I‚Äôll find a bottle sooner or later
Shhh don't tell anyone!


Yeah, I finished my A123 pretty quickly. Picked up a B923 a few days ago. It's not for everyone with that heat but its a good dark wheater. It's the Ecbp/stagg of wheat for sure.
I've never seen one in Southern California in the last four years."

************

**Elijah Craig Barrel Proof C923, 66.5%**

**Nose:** Deep toasted oak, heavy vanilla, tobacco, smooth wood spice, rich musty wood, corn, black cherry. Thick oaky nose but smoothly balanced with lots of sweetness, it's delicious and super inviting

**Taste:** Heavy toasted oak, smoothly tannic but also lots of sweet toasted notes, gritty tobacco, sweet toasted vanilla, sweet corn, black cherry, smooth wood spice. Thick gritty mouthfeel but the flavor flows beautifully, an excellent rich oaky Bourbon

**Finish:** Black cherry and menthol, gritty toasted wood, vanilla, mild drying tannic notes. Big finish

********************

Damn this batch is beautiful. I haven't been a big fan of ECBP for a long time, ever since they changed to the modern bottle shape. It's great that they kept the 12 year age statement and all but honestly it never counted for much to me because the quality seemed to take a serious dive. Modern ECBP always drinks way younger than it's age, it's a hot mess and is usually seriously lacking in any big oak notes you would expect from the age. But then they will randomly release a batch like C919 or this one that is just fantastic. It's great they still got it and can deliver great stuff like this, but I really wish it was more consistent.

Score: **8/10**
This is probably my favorite bourbon ever, having sampled quite a few over the last couple of years. It really sets the bar and I can't find anything I like as well. Simply outstanding.
This batch seemed so much more polished than any other batch i have since i started buying them with A121
I bought into the hype on this one and glad I did. I will gladly pay up to $110 for this bottle. (I paid msrp for my current bottle)
Very sad I missed this one. Love ECBP. I buy every release even if it's the only bourbon I buy that month.
Definitely my favorite bourbon by a lot. I do love the funk of ECBP but this is so smooth and delicious. Great review and keep them coming.
I‚Äôm keeping my eye out for one of these. The only other EC I‚Äôve tried is the Toasted Barrel and I really enjoyed it.
They didn‚Äôt keep the 12 year age statement‚Ä¶
Bought a case of 6. About to kill my 1st. Gave the 2nd to a friend. Happy to know I‚Äôve still got 4 left.
I‚Äôm stoked that I still have two unopened bottles of the same batch C923. A local liquor store near me (So Cal) was asking $400 per bottle but because I have a friendly relationship with the storeowner he sold them to me for $150 because of the volume I buy from him.
No peanut note?
Same - I‚Äôm trying to pick up a couple back up bottles on secondary.
I have so many ‚Ä¶ a little hot for me.
Yes that is an excellent way to put it, it feels very polished. Most ECBP I taste is a hot mess and drinks younger than its age to me. This one isn't just better rhan average, it feels like an actual well crafted bourbon
Hmmm, I thought b522 and c922 had really good balance.  Less powerful in the flavor department compared to monster that is c923 though.
Toasted and ECBP are very very different. Just an FYI.
They kept it when they switched to the current bottle shape - that's what OP's referring to. They changed it just this past year, long after the pirate bottle era.
You're right, I forgot they started doing younger batches now. I don't really keep up with ECBP anymore. I was referring to them keeping the 12yr age statement in 2017 when they switched to the current bottle shape
Did you find them recently? I've checked a dozen stores many times over and haven't found c923.
I don‚Äôt remember this batch giving off nuttiness.  I just checked my notes (did a blind c920 vs c923) and I notated there was some almond butter in the nose and mild nuttiness in the finish.
I get that. I'm a slow sipper, so that helps.
The A124 bottle isn't 12yo. Idk what bottle shape people are talking about, it's the same as all the other bottle I own?
Come and gone sorry. Got mine months ago. Have to go third party probably
Interesting. My initial impression on the palate was peanut butter.
That just means all the ECBP bottles you own are from the last several years. They switched from the old wide/squat ""pirate bottle"" shape to the contemporary shape around 2015 or 2017 or something - several years ago. 

The only ECBP batches so far that aren't 12 yo are B523 & A124.
I own an A124, C923, some older bottlings.. maybe I have to look closer, I'll check when I get home but if its different its a negotiable difference bc I notice very niche changes in things and this is the first I'm even contemplating they changed the bottle shape. Obviously they've changed the label to include age statements but other than that I haven't noticed anything.
Sorry for the confusion. I was referring to when ECBP changed to the current bottle style in 2017. The batches before that were amazing, and I was referring to the fact that quality dived after that even though they kept the 12yr age statement. I had forgotten that they recently started doing younger batches.

*************************

**Ledaig 2005 17yr G&M ""Connoisseur's Choice"" K&L pick, 2nd fill sherry hogshead 54.3%**

**Nose:** Boggy peat, iodine, burnt rubber, toffee, light sweet red fruits, sweet toasted wood, vanilla, mild spice

**Taste:** Big sharp peat, tar, medicinal and boggy, thick caramel, spice, menthol, toasted wood, vanilla, light red fruits, just a hint of sulfury wine

**Finish:** Big peat, gritty toasted wood, caramel, ashy char, tingly menthol and spice, lingering sweet vanilla and peat 

***************

Much like the Bunnahabhain this is a big peated Scotch that hasn't been tempered with age, with just a very light sherry influence but it actually drinks more like an active Bourbon barrel. There's more caramel wood notes and vanilla, more toasted sweetness, than wine-y fruits. But some subtle sweet red fruits and wine do creep in. Peat is huge and sharp, all comes together really well. A delicious peaty Ledaig with rich barrel notes and subtle fruit, just don't look for lots of sherry.

Score: **8/10**
Great review! I wish this was $10 lol
Great review but I fucking hate burnt rubber, Lol. That Clynelish, though, sounded great. Cheers dude.  That said, love me some  Ledaig.
Sounds awesome! I have the clynelish from this set and it's so good I want to check out the others
Great review! Real excited to open this one soon!
I dont know how specific of a note it is. It's just the kind of thing that comes through to me in a super peaty scotch sometimes. Like iodine and tar and gritty char, not a pleasant sounding note on it's own but just works in a peated scotch
I never did a final roundup of all the releases, but the clynelish is easily the best of the series. I personally put the glenlivet 20 up there with it too because I'm a sucker for a good malty scotch. Bunna was a close 3rd for me as a great peat monster, and this ledaig along with it too. Caol Ila was my least favorite and it still was pretty good
Awesome, I'd love to hear your thoughts when you do
Thank you so much for doing this series. It's great being able to see to have an alternative view to K&L's staff reviews before going in on a pricey bottle."

********************

**William Larue Weller 2022, 62.35%**

**Nose:** Sticky sweet toffee, creamy caramel, heavily toasted oak, vanilla, cherry fruit chew, smooth cinnamon. It's not a loud nose, more thick and oaky and creamy with some happy cherry sweetness

**Taste:** Bright syrupy cherry and cinnamon spice, sticky-sweet toffee, rich toasted oak, vanilla, creamy caramel. Despite the high abv it's not a hot action-packed kind of complexity. It all melds into this thick and oaky creamy-sweet Bourbon

**Finish:** Creamy toffee and sweet cherry rides out like candy, but with a thick rich oaky and vanilla backbone to balance it out from being too desserty. It's so freaking satisfying

**********************

You can tell right away from the nose that despite the high abv, this isn't just your every day barrel proof monster that slaps you in the face. It's more thick and creamy and syrupy-sweet. Instead of hot action-packed complexity it all just melds into this dense flavor. It's amazing. It's oaky but it's all toffee and vanilla type notes, nothing very tannic, combined with the sweet cherry and tingly cinnamon spice just wow.

I have a 2018 that‚Äôs got one more pour in it but I‚Äôm waiting until a special occasion to crack my 2019 so I can compare them. Maybe when one of my daughters has a kid? It‚Äôs crazy delicious and one of my absolute favorites.

57% was the barrel entry proof, then aged for 12 years 8 months

**Bunnahabhain 2009 14yr ""G&M Connoisseur's Choice"" K&L pick, 2nd fill sherry hogshead 55.3%**

**Nose:** Thick charred peat, sharp brine and iodine, toasted wood, vanilla, subtle berries and strawberry, caramel, smooth spice. 

**Taste:** Big gritty peat, burnt rubber, sweetly charred wood, vanilla, subtle sulfury red fruits, toffee, mellow spice. Lots of heavy peat and vanilla and sweet barrel notes, minimal fruit, a delicious heavily peated Scotch

**Finish:** Heavy peat, brine, sweet barrel char, vanilla, smooth spice, caramel and subtle sweet fruits. Big peaty and toasted vanilla finish

*************

It's a peat monster which is not what I was expecting from this one. Usually these go under the Staoisha name, or I thought K&L might have at least labelled it as peated Bunna. Also I've never seen a Staoisha this old. Usually they are 5-10 years old. Always a solid peated Scotch even at the younger age, and now this one is great with some proper aging on it too. Any sherry influence is minimal here, it's mostly a really nice charred peat monster with more vanilla and toasted barrel sweetness than any fruit sweetness. The age smooths it all out but it stays thick, gives it some heavy vanilla but without taming the peat. Drank blind I may have guessed this as a bourbon barrel Caol Ila. There is some subtle fruits that creep in but I had to really look for it. Strong sherry or not, it's a delicious peat monster

Score: **8/10**
When I saw the title and then the description, I was thinking how can this be?!
You had me until the burnt rubber. I‚Äôve recently purchased a Ben Nevis, great nose but OMG, burnt rubber. That  Clynelish is  very tempting. Beyond tempting. If I can order it, I will. Cheers.
I love Staoisha. For the unpeated Islay distillery, it sure does peat really well!
Thanks. Interesting. I think I can stay away.

How would you rate your overall experience with Gordon and MacPhail bottlings versus other IBs?
My experience with G&M has mostly been very good. And the Connoisseur's Choice bottlings have been especially great, even before these K&L picks"

**Finish:** Cherry cola, sweet candy cherry, smooth spice, toffee toasted wood, tons of sweet vanilla. This one also holds onto that perfect flavor and mouthfeel all the way through the long finish

************************************

For all the variation Pibous can have, these are surprisingly similar casks that I randomly ended up reviewing together. And they are both fucking fantastic. Makes for a fun sbs to see the subtle differences in a particular Pibous profile. Smooth in a thick and sludgy way with big dense flavor, but at the same time they have this super easy-drinking quality. Big cherry cola and candy sweetness with tons of heavy vanilla and smooth dark toasted wood. 

Pibous #140 is more complex, has slightly brighter fruit but it's thicker and more dense at the same time. #117 has these beautiful vanilla notes and a longer, sweeter finish that hits just a little better. It's really splitting hairs to find a winner here. Overall it would be Rennaissance #140, but the finish on #117 really helps even things out. In the end, I decided that the only winner here is me.

**Finish:** Long finish of sweet red berries, bright sugary barley, honey, vanilla frosting, some gritty oak and malt on the tail end 

***************

Exactly the kind of profile I look for in a Scotch with a lighter sherry influence. Sweet malt with balanced fruits that compliment instead of overwhelm. Much more impressive than your average super dark sherry bomb, this is sherry aging at it's finest imo. Clynelish always seems to pull it off so well somehow. I don't know if Clynelish has some magic that makes it work wonders with sherry, or producers just age it in extra special sherry casks or what. But they tend to be special in my experience and this one is no exception.

Nice review, I really enjoyed this one as well!
I don't know how that works, but I just meant whoever is aging these in general. They must be giving Clynelish special casks or something. It's just so consistently good with a sherry influence. And usually I find IB sherry to be all over the place
G&M unlike most bottlers actually own their own (empty) barrels, which they use to barrel and age distillate, rather than just picking aged barrels at the distillery. G&M have a _lot_ of good barrels and have been doing this for 100 years."

Holy heck. One tasting is hardly enough to be sure but this might actually be worth the asking price.

**Finish:** Big cutting peat and spice, vanilla, tannic wood, funky herbal spice, it lingers peaty and bitter 

*************

Nose is amazing, flavor is good but has a few off notes unfortunately. The peat is huge and clean with a softness from the age that is really nice. Sweet caramel and dessert notes, vanilla, just the right amount of brine and ashy notes. Has the makings of a really beautiful Caol Ila. But the wood, which isn't even that heavy, has some unpleasant tannic bitterness along with a lot of spice heat. Also some weird herbal notes. It's not intense, doesn't ruin it or anything, still a good peaty Scotch. But just misses the mark a bit. I added a little water to see if it helps but it didn't. If anything it highlights the funky bitterness by softening everything else out.

Glenlivet has such a wonderful malt character to it, and all the wood from the first fill bourbon really comes through here without overwhelming it. Balances the two elements together really well which is a deceptively delicate thing to pull off. I usually prefer a little less oak in a barley-forward Scotch like this but it's done so well, nowhere near as oaky as it could be for a 1st fill at this age. A fruity sweet malty Scotch with the slightest oaky edge which is exactly what you would hope for from the stats alone. A beautiful Glenlivet

Oh, this looks great. I've been having a hard time finding Ib Glenlivets lately. 

I guess this is kind of a yearly release now with minor variations. I've had my eye on this for a while now and might pull the plug given your review: https://www.klwines.com/p/i?i=1715667&searchId=d4284d18-c73a-4d39-af21-369b49aad0f9&searchServiceName=klwines-prod-productsearch&searchRank=6
Glenlivet 12 was my intro to scotch many years ago. Have always thought it would be interesting to try a properly presented expression. Cool read for me, great review!
Its quite good. I drank some of the K&L one alongside this one. Very similar, but it is much brighter and fruitier and more barley forward with the refill bourbon cask. I'll be reviewing it soon. This one is thicker amd more woody.
A shame they got rid of the full strength Nadurra a while back.
Thanks! And same, the 12yr was my first Single Malt love and the distillery will always have a special place in my heart
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but they brought this back last year right?

I‚Äôd hope so, cuz I drank a 1 oz pour of this at a bar last night for $8 and decided it was my favorite of the 3 I tried last night and was gonna pick up a bottle.
Sorry, should have specified the original 16 year old version. Looks like they still have a clutch of NAS ones now."

Brandy review #163

**************

**Charron 1987 #53, 46.7%**

**Nose:** Smooth dark toasted oak, heavy vanilla, caramel, soy sauce, chocolatey grape, mellow wood spice

**Taste:** Grape, tart black cherry, caramel, thick vanilla, dark chocolatey toasted oak, tannic and mildly drying, barrel char, smooth wood spice.

**Finish:** Thick caramel and vanilla, grape, dark cherry, trails off into light soy sauce, drying tannins, chocolatey wood

In a word, satisfying. It's super drinkable, big flavor that all comes together thick and cohesive. Lots of darker wood and thick vanilla but doesn't overwhelm the fruit, still plenty of chocolatey grape and dark cherry. Just enough well-integrated tannins and soy sauce rancio to give it that extra dark edge but nothing too challenging. All comes together really well

Great review! I had a sample from Philly and realty enjoyed it. Dark fruit, cinnamon, cola, chocolatey oak, well balanced."

**Clynelish 2009 13yr G&M Connoisseur's Choice K&L pick, refill sherry 57.8%**

**Nose:** Dark and fruity with just enough sweetness, toffee, tart jammy berries, brooding spice, toasted wood, wood spice  

**Taste:** Sweet sugary fruit, brighter and sweeter than the nose, berries, cherry, strawberry, toffee, toasted wood, lots of sweet barley malt, caramel. It all melds cohesively into a sweet toffee/fruity/malty Scotch, beautiful stuff. A very drinkable mouthfeel with big flavor that goes down easy

**Finish:** Fruity berry and spice builds even brighter, strawberry, cherry, caramel, sweet toasted wood. Sweet happy finish

***********

Beautiful sherry influence on this. Not wine-y or sulfury at all, it's a happy and sweet fruity sherry. Lots of sweet malt comes through too with some richer caramel and toasted wood notes and it all melds cohesively into one tasty Scotch. Clynelish seems to always pull off sherry very well. On it's own it doesn't have an especially robust malt character to me, but it somehow shines through really well with a nice sweet sherry influence like this. Super drinkable, my main complaint is that when I buy sherried Scotch it's never this good haha

Score :**8/10**
I got this one for $140, I think it went on sale. I hope we get a similar price drop on the current Clynelish they have in stock! The sherry presents beautifully without just being a sherry bomb.
Oh hey, I've tried [a sister cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/soheyb/review_703_clynelish_13_2007_gordon_macphail/) to this one! Similar kinds of notes to yours, and also very tasty.
Can you taste the waxiness on this one ?
Great review my friend! I actually picked this bottle up as well.  It's really tasty,  and for me the clynelish still comes through the cask enough. I get a really distinct caf√© mocha note on this that is beautiful. Happy new year!

Edit: so mine was actually a sister cask it seems,  a little lighter in color at 56.7% abv. 
https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/239344/clynelish-2009-gm
Great little distillery, if you ever stumble across the flora and fauna version I‚Äôd snap it up. That being said , I got it when it first came out, I believe the price has shot up since.
G&M probably put out a few sister casks also in EU (I have [this](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/239344/clynelish-2009-gm) one). But I've yet to try it. A friend told me there's no wax in there tho as it seems also in yours.
Yeah totally agree. I'm not a big fan of sherry bombs, it's just too overwhelming. I like it to still taste like a Scotch and not a straight up wine. It's a delicate thing to pull off well
U try the new one??
Right on. These Connoisseur's Choice bottlings seem to have a pretty good track record from what I've seen and tasted
Nothing like that jumped out at me. I don't always get the waxiness from Clynelish, and it's usually a lighter Bourbon barrel aged one when I do
I fear wax is always more and more rare on this distillery. And given the availability of Clynelish (next to nihil), I'm looking for malternatives (Glen Keith, Benrinnes until 2007, Dailuane at times got it -when diageo made them mock Clynelish wax while it was shut off-).
I've got this one that you linked here. I don't know if I would call it waxy , or just creamy/ oily, but In my opinion the Clynelish spirit is still able to be felt through the cask influence.  I really like this bottle.
Thanks, I'll try it during the year maybe (I have a couple of others open, maybe when I run out of either, this might be the next in line). 
I do tend to think it swims better in bourbon than sherry (at least, I had the most memorable drams from Clynelish in ex bourbon).
Exactly my feelings.  I don't think I've heard many people say that they prefer their Clynelish sherried over a nice refill or bourbon offering!
yeah there are distilleries that swim better in either (or can swim well in anything eg. Linkwood is one of those that whatever the cask you throw at it, I think it still comes through).   
But Clynelish.. bourbon (to me). I had memorable ones from Adelphi (and still hit my balls not to have gotten more back when it was still possible), or like [this](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/75584/clynelish-1996-vm) (I have open a split from the same cask from a now closed italian Hotel).  


Now Clynelish is quite MIA in the indies, or at least those at a reasonable price.   


This G&M was a flyer I saw it, I saw it was sherry and I was a bit restrained but I see scores are adding up and opinions like yours sounds promising ;)"

**""Jack Daniel's Single Barrel"" Barrel Proof Rye, New Jersey Bourbon & Yacht Club pick 66.9%**

**Nose:** Big clean herbal rye, sweet toasted wood, coffee, mint, lots of complex herbal spice, maple, brash cherry and spice

**Taste:** Big herbal rye clean and bright, rich cherry wood, mint, sweet toasted wood, thick maple, bright lively rye spice. Hits huge but not in a hot or brash way. Always big big flavor on these that just explodes on the palate

**Finish:** Sharp herbal rye, bright rye spice builds, baking spices, toasted cherry wood, lots of maple sweetness

*************************

More grain forward compared to other ones I've had. Bold clean rye with lots of complex herbal notes and sweet maple wood. There's richer wood notes on the nose but then rye takes over on the palate. I usually find these to have a nice kind of gritty burnt coffee oakiness to them that I absolutely love, so I'm not as big a fan here where the wood is lacking a bit. It's not a complaint so much as a personal preference though. It's an excellent Rye and there's still plenty of sweet toasted wood to it. And variety is part of the fun of these single barrels anyway. I have a [standard bottling](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/18h7244/review_809_jack_daniels_single_barrel_barrel/) that I like more but it's great having one that is so different.

These just always hit
Jack Daniel's makes such amazing rye. It's not the rye-iest rye, but for a 70% rye mash bill it's still plenty rye flavored.
Paging u/prepreludesh to answer any questions OP might have about the picking group.
I haven‚Äôt tried the rye yet but their single barrel barrel proof bottles are fantastic. I‚Äôll have to grab this one when I get the chance
Did not realize they did picks of these. Ill keep my eye out... well, i buy these when i see them so... no change in behavior. Good review though
This is what I‚Äôm waiting for, a private barrel pick of this before I buy it.
I saw this bottle in a bourbon hunting video for $150 in South Carolina.

Blew my fucking mind.
I got lucky and got ahold of two non pick versions of these.  131.1 proof.  First drink was pretty harsh and full of flat flavors.  I came back a month later and it‚Äôs one of the best bottles I own.  Absolute banger.  Best part is they are $58 in my state.
These drink so smooth! I have a 67% bottle and absolutely no burn, all flavor!
Maybe it's not a group I'm familiar with, but the name is pretty self explanatory. They like Bourbon and yachting
I think he did a pretty good job here! Happy New Year to you and u/buckydean
For the Single Barrel Barrel Proof the Tennessee Whiskey and the Ryes are both great
No need to, the standard ones are all excellent from what I've had
Haha, I'm a member of the group and it's a bit of an inside joke.  Nobody owns a yacht, but between all of the guys, the largest watercraft any of them have is probably a canoe.  But we all enjoy bourbon except Jordan.  He's gone nuts for grapes and only talks about cognac now.
Happy new year!
Oh how funny haha I didn't realize. I had thought it was an odd combination of overlapping interests, bourbon and yachting but just figured there's all kinds of weird groups out there. 

Yeah I've been hit by the grape bug pretty hard too. Loving Armagnac and Cognac the last few years"

**Finish:** Gritty apple builds bigger and brighter, light spice, brown sugar and sweet toasted oak, then the sweetness slowly trails off and leaves some mildy tannic drying wood and apple. Long complex finish

*************

Fantastic apple brandy. It's quite woody which is no surprise given it's age, but far from being overoaked. The apple is bold and delicious and it smoothly intertwines with complex wood in a very well-balanced way. There's sweet toasted notes, toffee, heavier oak and tannins but nothing too harsh or drying. For the age I feel like I'm getting exactly what I would hope for. Big apple and oak that gives you more than your standard simple brandy or young Calvados. Easily as good as the stuff out of France, and I feel like the price is great for what it is.

Score: **8/10**
Just cracked my bottle and it is excellent. Agree it holds its own against any calvados I‚Äôve had before.
Especially over the last decade we‚Äôve had some pretty warm summers, so I‚Äôm not shocked it would have taken a good bit from the casks.
mmm, 15 year old Clear Creek apples. Currently available, but not forever. With the new ownership, who knows whether or not we will get another cask like this in the future. A lot has changed in those 15 years. Wouldn't sleep on this one my brandy loving friends."

**Taste:** Sticky-sweet toffee, bright cherry, sugary fruits, a delicious kind of sour rancio, makes a nice combo that is sharp and clean, sweet toasted wood, maple, vanilla, toffeed grape and spice

**Finish:** Toasted wood and cherry, tobacco, sugary fruits. Lingering sweet gooey mix of toffee, soy sauce, and maple 

*****************

This is delicious. It's bright and exuberant but that doesn't mean it's lacking richer wood notes. Lots of rich wood and vanilla and toffee, even maple, but the fruit and spice has such a nice pop to it. And just a bit of sharp rancio balances in nicely and gives it an interersting twist. This is complex in the best possible way. A lot of fun

What a delightful sherried Scotch. All the best parts of a sherry influence but without feeling oversaturated, maintains a very nice balance. Just happy jammy and sweet fruits over nice balanced toffee and malt. Smooth wood notes in there, pleasant spice. Elegant and easy drinking. Thick flavor but not huge or challenging in any way, no brutal cask strength heat to it. None of the funk or wine-y sulfur you sometimes get. Often these sherried malts can just be: ""Scotch + TONS of sherry = darcc,"" and the flavor lands wherever the hell it wants. This feels like a real Scotch, an actual finished product.

I'm a big Glengoyne fan... this stuff sounds fab.
Looks like a banger. Great review!
Great review.  I've never clicked with Glengoyne, but maybe something exceptional like this would help that happen.
I've never tried and now really want to. Well-played.
Nicely put, the summary put me right there with it.
Good on you! Dream bottle
Do you try both straight and with a little water when you‚Äôre reviewing?
Oh wow, yeah I got that like 3 years ago from The Whisky World. Miss it.
Glengoyne 10 has an astringent note to it. However, everything else about it is top shelf. Very heavy for 10 years and only 43%. 10 does not have enough Sherry. 

Glengoyne need to be Sherry forward and it is absolutely crackin.

Try the special editions that are Sherried, 15 and 18 are Sherry forward. 18 is one hell of a dram
Thanks, that means a lot! This one kind of wrote itself it was so good
I rarely add water. When I do, it's usually an attempt to improve something that I'm not totally enjoying. And it rarely works

I think this was an Astor pick even if they didn't put their name on the back label. I bought one when they ran a 15% brandy sale which helped to ease the regular $250 price tag (which was relatively high at the time). Astor had stock for a long time because of that.

**Nose:** Gentle and grassy, hay, barley sugars, green apple, just a touch refined malt. It's so delicate

**Taste:** Super oily mouthfeel, but the flavor is quite reserved. Light barley presence, grain sugars, hay smooth malt, tropical fruit. It's extremely smooth and refined, delicate even, to the point of being a little boring

**Finish:** Tropical fruit, smooth barley, lemon, just a hint of delicate spice

************

Sugary and grassy, a bit fruity. It's super delicate and light, to the point of being a little boring unfortunately. Nose is barely even there. It drinks extremely refined and smooth, has a nice oily mouthfeel, but doesn't deliver enough flavor. Tastes like it could be awesome at cask strength. I'm a big fan of malty Scotch and I had really high hopes for this stuff. For what a big deal they make out of their farm operation I was hoping for more robust Barley. But it just tastes like they set out to make the smoothest, lightest Scotch they could. The quality is there but it's just too light at 46%. Could be great if that's the kind of thing you are looking for.

**Taste:** Heavy campfire smoke, bbq meat, crisp clean peat, bright sugary vanilla frosting, sweet toasted wood, some gritty char, sugary tropical fruits, big peppery spice.

**Finish:**Big finish of sweet smoke, powdered sugar, sweet vanilla, berry and tropical fruits, sweet wood. Sugary smoky and peaty finish that builds big and draws out for ages


************

Not super complex, not insanely huge and doesn't have some impossible oaky peaty depth to it, but that's not such a bad thing. It's sweet and smoky and pleasant. It does very well at the high abv, it drinks smooth and doesn't feel like my palate is under attack. The 62% ABV just takes that sweet smoky pleasant character and really solidifies it into something thick and cohesive. It feels thick and very sure of itself in it's simplicity. It has a directness like it knows exactly what it wants to be. I enjoy it but it's probably not worth that price tag. It scores high, but for the price and the R&BT name you are kind of hoping for 9 or 10. A wine cask might have added a little more excitement(not that there's anything terribly wrong with this). I tend towards peat monsters like Laphroaig so it's still nice to have the unique fruity sweet bourbon-barrel peat that this one offers.

I am continually amazed at the quality of these Jack Daniels Single Barrels, both the Rye and the Tennessee Whiskey. The quality is so consistent. They have a very clear profile and are always running at full throttle with no relenting. I am a big rye fiend and consider my standards extremely high when it comes to Rye Whiskey, and this is some of the best I've had in some time. I usually prefer 95-100% rye mashbill because I crave that strong rye flavor. I don't know what this mashbill actually is but it totally has that big strong rye character. At the same time there's tons of robust oak with that delicious maple and dark roasted coffee profile that JD does so well. Huge and lively but in a well-balanced way. I'm in love with this stuff

I can't get enough of this stuff. I'll buy it every single time I come across it.
I love my barrel, i get bananas foster on the backend
Hoping these become more available in my area soon. Heard of some going for secondary prices and thought that was really silly. The Tennessee whiskey BP disappeared for a while around here after a couple of summers ago when everyone was raving about it, but now it‚Äôs almost everywhere again. So hopefully some patience pays off.
Really excited to crack into mine, but working through a scotchvent calendar 

Curious if you ever had a chance to try the 2020 LE the from JD, I‚Äôve heard these are good but don‚Äôt quite Stand up to that beast
I‚Äôm a simple man. I see a JD SiBBP rye review and I upvote. These just always hit and I love that distribution is increasing. I think there are three stores in my area with it on the shelf right now. You love to see it.
Love my bottle. I get a huge burnt banana bread taste from it. Even though it‚Äôs a little hot for me it‚Äôs a great sipper.
Nice review. These are just plain amazing.
This stuff is incredible; an absolute wallop of a pour in the best way. FWIW, Jack Daniel's rye products are 70% rye, 18% corn, 12% malted barley.
If the rye has that same runts banana taste as regular jd, it's a hard pass. I know some of you get a more pleasing banana taste/aroma, but it is much more of an artificial taste to me.
This is one of my favourite Rye‚Äôs and the best whisky I‚Äôve had in a long time.
Recently purchased a bottle then a back up bottle at my local retailer.  This is an outstanding product and I highly recommend.  I think it tastes more like a bourbon than a rye to be quite honest.
This stuff is a unicorn in my parts.
I wish I could even come across it.
Dude the coolest part with all of their sbbp is almost every bottle is unique. You can pick up  3 bottles and all 3 will keep you interested. Unbelievable
I know what you mean - I'm up to 4 so far.
Yeah I know what you mean. I'm really smitten with the stuff it just satisfies
yeah I get tons of banana in mine, which I love.
I was about to second this - we just cracked ours and I get banana pudding (creamier) on the palate leading out to bananas foster, more of that burnt sugar on the end.
I finally got two bottles after searching for a few years, so hopefully that's a sign they are becoming a little more common. A few comments here kind of indicate that too. Good luck!
No, never tried that one sorry
Ah thanks. I remember it was pretty high rye but couldn't remember exactly how much. I guess I'll have to start amending my usual statement that I only drink 95-100% mashbill rye
Come on down to Austin. It‚Äôs sitting on the shelf at TW right now
Make a trip to the distillery. Well worth doing the Angel's Share tour where you get to try all four of the single barrel series. All four are fantastic. You can also buy these bottles in the gift shop. 

The coolest thing I learned on that tour is they make 80 gallons of finished product every minute...24/7/365. Pretty amazing to see.
We gotta fix that next time we meet. IMO they're pretty close."

‚Äúso we'll do 4 parts 1993 Belair, 2 parts '86 Cassou, 1 part 08 Pouy‚Äù and the volume used was based on wanting 500 bottles
How cool, thanks!
It appears that the grape of the art 93 Belair was the remainder of cask 8L.
There was also a bottling of 8L for a Tennessee shop I think."
"Review #807: Calumet 16yr ""Single Rack Black"" Bourbon, 53%",,https://i.redd.it/9b98ttxo5s5c1.jpg,"A bunch of these started hitting the market a while back in the 14-16 year range, I don't know much about them except that they are apparently Barton distilled. Not a bad price for what they are and I heard a few good things so had to grab one since I love oak. Got this for $130

American Whiskey review #294

****************

**Calumet 16yr ""Single Rack Black"" Bourbon, 53%**

**Nose:** Toffee, deep toasted oak, vanilla, dark woody cherry, cocoa, tobacco, smooth dark tannins, lightly drying

**Taste:** Thick dark oak, woody toffee, smooth tannic wood, vanilla, gritty toasted oak, tobacco, menthol, slightly drying wood and spice. It's heavy oak, but only slightly drying and tannic. Stays smoothly balanced with lots of sweeter toasted notes

**Finish:** A long sweet and woody finish of brown sugar, toasted oak, black cherry, sweet toasted vanilla, corn, trails off with some lightly drying musty wood and menthol

***********************

A really nice deep oaky profile that you don't get in Bourbon a lot. Not even remotely over-oaked to me although my threshold for oak is pretty high thanks to Armagnac. It's not super tannic or drying either, there's plenty of vanilla and toasted sweetness and it all balances out smoothly. Even if you aren't the biggest fan of heavy oak I think it's a somewhat accessible example of the style

Score: **8/10**
Barton doesn't get tons of love here, but this is one of my favorite widely available high aged bourbons. Your notes are spot on.
I got a lot of tobacco on this one. Similar to smoking a cigar without actually doing it. Good for when uiu want that taste without the smoke
This was too oak forward for me at fresh crack, however I revisited it after being open for ~8 months and it‚Äôs much tamer and more palatable while keeping all those deep oak and cherry flavors
Nice write-up. Tim‚Äôs is my favorite whiskey I‚Äôve had. Got a bottle for Father‚Äôs Day and killed it much faster than I expected.
I agree completely with your notes.  It‚Äôs interesting to me how much different the 16 tastes compared to the 15.  If they are really all center rack cuts from the same warehouse, the batching should taste pretty similar and then you can really see the difference aging does.  In this case, the 15 was cherry rock candy and oak.  16 was much more tobacco and overall darker notes while the fruit pretty much vanished.
The manager at my ABC recommended the 15 year, picked it up yesterday at Costco to try.
Thanks! Tastes can vary a lot so it's always fun when someone agrees with my notes. 

I'm surprised at how good it is, for the price and age it almost seemed too good to be true. But yeah it delivers and it drinks it's age just like I was hoping it would"

**""Thompson Brothers Isle Islay"" (Laphroaig) K&L 1991 29yr, refill hogshead 50.8%**

**Nose:** Huge clean peat, tar, burnt rubber, thick buttery and creamy notes, toasted wood, vanilla, bright lemon and fruit, pepper. God it's so huge and sharp

**Taste:** Big peat, super clean and bright, brine, caramel, gritty char, vanilla, creamy dessert notes, tropical fruits, sweet peppery spice. It explodes on the palate, everything is so crisp and clean and bright.

**Finish:** Clean sharp peat, tropical fruits, sweet toasted wood, sugary pastry, peppery spice builds to add a fun little spice kick but without any real heat

************

This is amazing. Age has not tamed this peat at all, if anything it feels like it's been tempered and refined. Maybe just not as medicinal as other Laphroaig but who knows if that's an age thing or a vintage thing. The peat is huge but it's so crisp and clean and bright. It cuts through hugely. At the same time it stays well-balanced on the whole. Tons of sweet wood and dessert notes, tropical fruits, brine, lemon. Just a hint of char and burnt notes to give it that gritty edge. Words are failing me, it's just such a great Laphroaig experience. 



Score: **9/10**
Ooof, sounds like one hell of a Laphroaig! Nice review
It was explained to me, that once Laphroaig reaches the quarter century mark, that much of the pit disappears and what‚Äôs left is a tropical fruit bomb of a of a dram. I‚Äôm now left wondering what that particular YouTube reviewer was talking about and I am confused about what I should expect when looking at older peated whiskey.
Yeah once you get to laph 25 and up its another experience. If you prefer peat bombs quarter cask is your jam"

**Finish:** Sweet toasted wood and drying tannins, brightens up on the tail end with fruity grape, cherry and vanilla, lingering dry wood spice

***********

A really nice dark and fruity Armagnac. Leans slightly to the more tannic and rancio side but not too heavy. Has enough vanilla and fruit to go along with all the complex dark wood notes. The nose especially is quite fruity, then the wood takes over a little more on the palate. Really well-balanced overall. Rich flavor that isn't too tame or too hot, this stuff drinks great.

**Russell's Reserve Single Barrel K&L 17-550, 55%**

**Nose:** Warming caramel, cherry toasted wood, thick thick vanilla, wood spice, cedar, clove. Warm and full, delicious, ridiculously inviting

**Taste:** Big toasted wood, rich caramel, sweet vanilla, cherry, milk chocolate, rich and woody and toasted. It's so full bodied, a rich and flavorful mouthfeel that coats the mouth, just fantastic.

**Finish:** Sweet toasted wood, thick vanilla, a pop of sweet cherry and mild spice, the sweetness and vanilla lingers

*******

This Bourbon is just about perfect. The combination of big toasted wood, thick vanilla and cherry is just magical. Effortlessly balanced and drinkable in a way that Wild Turkey does so well. Not super complex, and not a brutal cask strengthen  that jumps out and slaps you around. It's almost like dusty Turkey in it's beautiful simplicity. Tons of rich flavor but at the same time it drinks so easy. In a Bourbon landscape of Staggs and FRPS and other huge bruisers, it's easy to forget this more balanced style. It just feels so right, and Wild Turkey does it so well. This pick is from 2017, I haven't had a modern RR SiB in a long time. I hope they are still putting out stuff like this

Score: **9/10**
I just got an early Xmas present of this (not store pick) my GF picked up from meijer. I never have had it but told her I wanted to try some of the Russell bottles. She seen this and grabbed it for me, I thought I was a Buffalo Trace distillery guy‚Ä¶. I was wrong lol. This blew me away, the flavors in it were perfect for me, it quickly has become my favorite bottle. I am now looking to try all the Wild Turkey bottles I can.
I have had good luck with these, that K&L sounds amazing. Curious, do you argon gas your bottles or any other tricks to maintain consistency over time? Cheers!
This is the next one I want to try. I am a fan of buffalo trace bourbons, but I am now coming around to wild turkey products. Russles 10 is such a delicious pour. So easy to drink and rich in flavor. I enjoy single barrel pours and hope this is just as great. Thanks for the info!
I find it weird that this looks like store pick but also not in a private select bottle
So confused with all these new stickers. So this is the exact same as the old all maroon label?

Disregard. Just read again and this bottle is from 2017
K&L really did get the good stuff before most were aware of what was out there‚Ä¶
‚ô•Ô∏è K&L
Where did you purchase your paintings?
I don't quite think people understand how much better the older RR picks were over the ones of today
2022s and 2023s have almost all been bangers (like starting at 7/10 and going up from there).  There's hardly a disappointing run of of barrels that are prefixed 22 or 23. I don't know if they're quite on tier with the 2017s/2018s/2019s as a whole, but after 2020s and 2021 were slightly disappointing they're right back on track. The shelfers are frankly also excellent right now.
I recommend you try some Rare Breed next. Different beast from Russell's and really great stuff. Kentucky Spirit is good too
I also love the regular old Russell's 10.  Great bourbon.  I've seen it at liquor stores around $45 or so, but I used to pick it up regularly for $35.  It's amazing at that lower price if you can find it.  It's still worth it at the higher price.
No I've never done anything special. Corks can dry out and shrink, so check the cork from time to time. If it feels like its gotten a little loose, replace it. Keep all your old corks so you have a pile of different sizes to draw from
This is how they used to do them. If you lost the tag you were screwed, there is nothing on the bottle or label showing it is a pick
I remember these used to sit in stock for ages. There was even a few times K&L put them on clearance to get.rid of them. I have a few of that I got for about $40 this way
They are one of the best and not just for bourbon. I‚Äôm currently sipping on a 4R BBL pick from 2014. It‚Äôs an insane bottle. The old 10 year whistle pigs that were actually much older are unreal. I‚Äôm glad I got into bourbon, and stocked up, before the craze was in full effect.
I don't even remember where it's from, I've had it forever. I think you can find similar posters with a Google search
Agree 100%, especially about the run of the mill RR single barrel shelfers.   They are all quite good, and I grab one whenever I travel to Ohio for work.
That was next on my list, what Rare Breed you recommend? Thought I seen there were a few different ones.
Rare breed is going to be in my stocking‚Ä¶special request
I see it here and there, how is the flavor compared to the single barrel? I love the cinnamon vanilla flavors I get from it. Is it sweet like that?
Thank you. I did not know about that! Though I have yet to see a store select anywhere. Hopefully one day. That sucks about the tag. How many of them would just fall off
Incredible
Awesome üòé Thanks!
There's just a bourbon and a rye, stick with the bourbon. There have been different batches over the years but they are all good. Whatever current batch that's out is fine
All Wild Turkey (unless I'm missing some niche products) have the same mashbill. So you will get the same vibe throughout their product line. RR single barrel to me is the top of what they have to offer (besides their almost impossible to get releases like RR13). The normal 10 year Russell's Reserve is a toned down version of the single barrel, or even Rare Breed. I would honestly recommend all of them depending on how much you want to spend, there isn't much to dislike (as a wild turkey guy).
They wouldn't fall off, I never had a problem. Just saying it was a funny way to designate picks
In my suspicious moods, I thought less-than-fully-honest stores might be putting neck tags on the standard option to try and sell them for more!
I thought I had become a Buffalo Trace guy too until I drank Rare Breed. It‚Äôs jumped to the top of my list, and as a plus it‚Äôs easy to get where I live. The desired Buffalo Trace products are allocated in Alabama.
Picks for the state of New York still have a hang tag with blank back label."

American Whiskey review #292

**************

**Wild Turkey 12yr 101**

**Nose:** Caramel, sweet toasted wood, vanilla, smooth tobacco, light chocolate, corn, fruity pear, berries. Sweet and smooth and woody

**Taste:** Caramel, smooth toasted oak, slightly drying, cocoa, woody cherry, sweet vanilla, gentle wood spice. It's a super smooth and easy-sipping woodiness, light mouthfeel, slightly drying but enough sweetness to level it out keep it from being anything super oaky or challenging 

**Finish:** Wood spice, smooth tannic dryness, sweetly toasted oak, vanilla, some sweet berry

************

I'm digging this stuff, it's a nice little Wild Turkey. It drinks like a premium Bourbon that is really going for smoothness and accessibility. It's a woody step up from the standard 101 but not crazy oaky. There are elements of slightly drying tannic oak but nothing too challenging, and still plenty of vanilla and sweetness to level it out. All smoothly balanced and easy-sipping. Almost too light sometimes but it's still delicious. I feel like I should note this is nothing like the dusty 12yr stuff from the 90's. This drinks much lighter, it's missing the body and oily mouthfeel and thick vanilla of those old gems. It's a fine Bourbon, worth picking up if you get a chance, but maybe not worth going crazy trying to hunt it down or pay a premium for imo

Score: **7/10**
Wild to me that they sell this for $60-ish, with all the epic packaging it‚Äôs STILL cheaper for me than Rare Breed!
This is a bottle that just leaves me wanting more after my first pour... I would personally put it ~8-8.5/10 as it's just so good... but I could crush this bottle in a night with friends very easily
I love this stuff. It‚Äôs on par with Russell‚Äôs 13 for me. Just depends on if I want the higher proof or long finishing mellowness
Love regular 101 so I'll have to keep an eye out for this. But what I noticed is the 700ml bottle size. Hate this, I figured this was going to start happening with distilleries, indulging in shrinkflation. JD's BIBs are 700ml also. Ugh.
So why is it ranked the same as regular WT101?
How does one get this? Online sites?
Didn‚Äôt have it so won‚Äôt comment on the taste but it seems funny to me to package it as a premium bottle when it‚Äôs a marginal step up from the ‚Äúmeme‚Äù entry level bottle.
Just picked this up on a trip to Australia! Can‚Äôt wait to try it.
Can‚Äôt find this bottle for less than $200.
One of the most drinkable bourbons I‚Äôve had. Drinks much lower than the already low proof. Not a fan of turkey products usually, but the flavor profile was much better than something like rare breed or RR13. I remember RR13 having a more intense flavor, but I think I prefer WR12. Hard to tell without tasting side by side. If you‚Äôre thinking about getting one it‚Äôs very approachable and easily likable.
Wow. I pick up Rare Breed for $50 or less. What‚Äôs going on in your neck of the woods?
Same. Mine is halfway gone and I‚Äôm getting sad about that.
It just doesn't have that appeal for me. It's good but nothing that blows me away. I think I will mostly use it to impress more casual Bourbon drinkers, the packaging and flavor profile screams ""smooth, premium bourbon.""
I'm with you. I think it's got better flavor than the RR13 (batches 4 and 5, I haven't tried the others). RR13 has it beat on proof, but that's it. I prefer this WT12.
That's a really good comparison, I can see that. Two different expressions that do a similar kind of thing, but each tailored for specific markets
It's from Japan, 700ml is standard over there
Maybe but then if its just exclusive to Japan then you will be paying one heck of a shipping charge
It does pop up at some stores and online sites now and then for about $200, which is way too much. Otherwise you or a friend has to go to Japan and bring some back
If your near Louisville, Neat Bar has it for sal at $149. Pickup only, no shipping.
Marginal step up? It's nearly twice as old.
You're not gonna unless you go to Japan
WA has high prices and higher taxes. It‚Äôs about $70 OTD around here
I see now, thanks. But I have noticed a small but seemingly growing tide of 700ml bottles. The two JD's BIB examples I mentioned earlier. Another is Arran 10, which I special ordered the 750 over a year ago but my ABC rep told me someone twice-cancelled it because ""they are transitioning from 750ml to 700ml"" and ""have not yet set it back in the system"". I suspect the distillery is not adding the 750 back in the system.

I think this is less of a case of US standards bending toward more global ones and more of shrinkflation, but so-called global standards provide the perfect pretext to do it.
I stand corrected then, I was led to believe the basic one was 8yo
Damn spirit taxes‚Ä¶
Come on down to OR my man. $49.95 and it‚Äôs everywhere.
It's said to be between 6-8, but there is no official age statement. Especially with bourbon, I think that's a pretty material difference. Even the Wild Turkey 8 in Japan is sought after and this has 4 years on those.
WT101 is 8 years in Japan but not everywhere else.  Also the WT101 8 year tastes way different from the WT101 we have stateside.  It's much more mellow and doesn't carry much if any turkey funk.  At least that's the way my bottle was when I picked one up for night caps at the hotel.
Yeah, I struggle to get out of OR with less than a case of stuff anytime I go‚Ä¶"
Review #802: Wild Turkey 101,,https://i.redd.it/osrzgi38d64c1.jpg,"Wild Turkey 101 is truly a ‚Äúwhat should Bourbon taste like‚Äù example that all others are judged against.  It‚Äôs the old reliable for most Bourbon drinkers, for a very obvious reason.
It‚Äôs cliche but this is where it started for me. Not just bourbon but drinking whiskey neat. It always cracks me up when people turn their nose up at you for grabbing a WT101 and they grab a BT or Weller SR. To each their own I guess.

**Wild Turkey 101**

**Nose:**  Bold corn, toasted oak, tobacco, caramel, cinnamon, musty wood, light funk

**Taste:** Sweet caramel and corn, toasted wood, faint green apple, smooth corn funk, soft herbal spice, cinnamon. An easy sipping mouthfeel, smooth and sweet and flavorful without being overly light 

**Finish:** Cinnamon spice carries through into the finish with sweet caramel and corn, sweet toasted wood, vanilla, hint of corny turkey funk

*******************

Such a satisfying Bourbon especially for being so dang cheap and readily available. I haven't had it in a long time and I can tell how much my thresholds have changed since back then. It's much sweeter than I remember, lots of corn but it's a delicious sweet corn not spirity or youthful. Not as spicy as I remember either, it's pretty easy-drinking. The higher abv delivers nice flavor without any harshness. It kind of covers all the Bourbon bases: There's toasted wood and caramel notes, a touch of tobacco, but also brighter fruits and corn sweetness, some herbal notes, some gentle spice and cinnamon. Does it all in a well-balanced way without leaning too hard in any one direction. Just a classic Bourbon

Personally hate the flavour change and now Rare Breed has done it too
And now their Rye is just as solid . . .
Had a dram last night while watching FSU/Louisville. Incredible drink for the price and availability.

It's ridiculous how solid this pour for the price. It's also ridiculous that so many of us (myself included) get suckered by marketing and fancy labels and bottles. Wild Turkey 101 is the real deal.
If you know, you know‚Ä¶..The Russel‚Äôs do it right.
I‚Äôve always got a bottle of 101 rye on hand - normally under $20 also.
This is my go to, as I live in an ABC state and can‚Äôt get allocated bourbons. But, I love this juice! Always reminds me of the Coke gummy bottle candy. üòÅ

MAN it took me way too long to make my way to WT101. By and far one of my favorites. Phenomenal pour. WT101 and Elijah Craig are a bourbon‚Äôs bourbon to me.
The WT Long Branch is even better and not that much more !!!Just a FYI üòä
As they over pay for BT or Weller
I used to love the chase, but since 2020 or so have pretty much just relied on staples, anchored by WT101. It's so good. It's cheap. It has the proof for cocktail applications.

It's legitimately fantastic.

Unicorns are fun, but workhorses are much better in the long run.

Nice review.
>  I can tell how much my thresholds have changed since back then. It's much sweeter than I remember, lots of corn but it's a delicious sweet corn not spirity or youthful. 

When I started actually tasting bourbon instead of just drinking, I legitimately thought WT101 had a lot of pepper spiciness. Years later, and with a ton of different experiences I've also come to where you are. It's a lot sweeter than I remember it.
Great Review. 

This is one that everyone should have in their bars.  Covers all the bases.  It's consistent, it's good, it's inexpensive, it's widely available, it's good for everything from sipping neat to cocktails.
Prideful, perhaps?
Was thinking the same thing
Did you get one this year?
Super agree with this - I could have written it myself. 

I don‚Äôt regret the years of exploring the range of options (ie, generally more expensive choices which, I will admit, helped me refine my palate), and will usually have a treat bottle or two on the shelf, but WT101 is a constant presence.If it was easier to get where I live my rotation would probably be Rare Breed and OF1920 but since it is not, then WT101 wins the day.
The chase is still fun as long as you aren't going too crazy with it. The stakes are just a lot lower when you have solid reliable stuff to fall back on
I suspect they‚Äôve changed it up in recent years - it has definitely got sweeter in the past two or three years than what I remember from before.

**Wild Turkey 8yr 101 (1989)**

**Nose:** Caramel, toasted oak, maple and vanilla smoothly coats, corn, mild cinnamon, berry fruits underneath it all 

**Taste:** Smooth toasted oak, root beer, vanilla, maple, thick caramel, some sweet fruits meld in with all the oak. It has this velvety thick mouthfeel, it's not ""big"" but coats the mouth beautifully and just feels so right. Lots of vanilla and maple and sweetness that keeps it from feeling too heavily oaked.

**Finish:** Cinnamon spice, vanilla, tobacco, mint, smooth toasted oak. Smooth oak and toasted vanilla lingers with just the right amount of sweetness

* A delicious old school Bourbon. It's not huge or powerful in any way that smacks you in the face. It just has this perfect nose and mouthfeel that feels so right. The nose is delicious in a way that is hard to describe, I can't stop nosing the empty glass. Lots of vanilla and caramel, it's rich but smooth and welcoming. It has a velvety soft mouthfeel, and the flavor all glides along effortlessly. The wood tends towards richer maple and vanilla type notes with just a hint of tannins, lots of smooth oak and sweetness and even some fruits. It's deceptively complex but all comes together so well. It's just so damn drinkable. From an age when smooth didn't mean boring.

**Taste:** Toasted wood, brown sugar, caramel, sweet funky corn, fruity and bright, some spirity funk, light zingy spice

**Finish:** Sweet and sugary finish, sweet toasted wood, corn, brown sugar, funky corn

* More sweet and fun and bright compared to the 1989. It has a lighter presence overall, both on the nose and the mouthfeel, and a slight spirity corn funk to it that is a little off-putting. Agreeable sweet toasted wood notes. Good stuff and pretty impressive for being such a cheap and common Whiskey in Japan. These don't have much in common, so it feels different enough from the classic 8/101 that at least it doesn't drink like some lesser version of it. It has it's own thing going on and is a nice little sipper.

Wow! Congrats on 800! Old WT is definitely a worthy pour for the occasion.
Congratulations on #800, Bucky!  I hope to see 800 more reviews with that famous chimp in the background.  Cheers!
Just bought a bottle in Udon Thani, Thailand for around $54. Smooth drinker and agree with the review. FWIW, I brought a liter from home of the US nas 101 to here, as that‚Äôs the limit. This is better for sure.
Thanks for the nice reviews and comparison.  Sitting here on a cold winter day,  your description of the '89 made me thirsty.
Thanks! And it was a pleasure reviewing this one

Scotch review #318

**""Laphroaig Single Cask"" Mission pick, 2013 1st fill Bourbon (warehouse 1) 54.1%**********

**Nose:** Big clean medicinal peat, crisp and briny, creamy pastry, tar, sweet toasted wood, vanilla, green apple

**Taste:** Creamy pastry dessert notes, big clean medicinal peat, tar, sweet and briny, seaweed, tropical fruits. Big clean mouthfeel, bright and peaty and sweet

**Finish:** Softer peat, gritty brine, creamy vanilla, sugary frosting, soft spice, lingering sweet char and peat. 

*********

Interestingly, this reminds me a lot of the 2022 Cairdeas Warehouse 1. A very clean and sweet style of Laphroaig with a nice helping of brine. I love it. Plenty of big medicinal peat but it has a crispness and a freshness to it along with all that creamy dessert sweetness. Delicious and unique. For fun I poured some 2022 Cairdeas Warehouse 1 next to this. Similarities aside, it blows the Cairdeas away. It has more wood and vanilla notes and a bigger presence. Cairdeas feels simultaneously hotter and softer flatter flavor.

As much as I love it, that price is still a hard sell. It's a shame because these would be a lot of fun to collect at a more reasonable price, like how Bourbons such as Russell's Reserve or Four Roses do it(and at the same ages I might add). My impression after trying these 4 Single Casks is that they do truly deliver some great quality, and seem to be a safer bet than a lot of IB's. If you are a die-hard Laphroaig fan looking for something new and unique and are willing to spend the money, these won't disappoint. But if you simply want some high quality Laphroaig, the 10yr Cask Strength is still some of the best Scotch money can buy and at a fraction of the cost

Score: **8/10**
Watched the release/tasting and David saying Laphroaig stole his Warehouse 1 idea from that pick just really put a sour note in my mind about this pick. Didn't want to try it based on that snooty comment.
These have been fun reads. I looked at that one from Binny's but a bit crazy pricing for me. Now if it had been a Ben Nevis... maybe.  Looking forward to your 800th review. Man, that's just a lot of reviews.
God I read your review before I saw the price. Great review. 

Would you say the QPR for this is that much better than the Caurdeas Warehouse 1? That's my favorite whisky of all time.
Haha, I wasn't aware of that but yeah that does sound annoying. As if Laphroaig needs to be reminded about warehouse 1 being special. The 2015 Cairdeas was warehouse 1 Bourbon barrels, and is one of the finest Laphroaigs I've ever had.

Fun fact according to t8ke who did a pick there: The air in warehouse 1 is so salty that barrels can't age as long because the metal rings on the casks rust away
Thanks, it was a fun little series of laphroaigs. Agree the pricing is just too high on these and besides, judging from comments in my Binnys laphroaig review it seems divisive. I loved it but others really didn't. 

Review #800 will probably be a bourbon. I like to pour something special for big reviews and I just have more rare bourbons than anything else
I comment on it in the review, and I even drank them sbs since they are both warehouse 1. 

tl;dr the quality is there and as a big Laphroaig fan I'm not disappointed, but the QPR is a hard sell. $150-$200 would be difficult, $250 is just crazy

(full disclosure I'm crazy. I bought one but it was virgin French oak which was just too exciting to pass up)
I also loved the 2015 cairdeas! And thanks for the write ups! I've been wondering about the picks
Everyone has different tastes. Those Laphroaig s sounded great. 
Will you post #800 on r/bourbon?
Apologies, I read the whole post so I did see that part. I guess my specific question is at $95 for Warehouse 1 or $250 for the Mission pick is the QPR there? I'm also crazy and would happily buy it if I felt the quality/$$ was better for the mission pick.
Holy shit, long time no see! Great to hear from you and I'm glad you're still around. The days of r/Scotchswap are long gone but you are still a legend
Yeah, will probably be a dusty Wild Turkey
It might be worth it since you are such a big fan of the Cairdeas and I feel like it's an even better version of that one. But looking at Mission's website, it looks like it's gone so it's not a decision you will have to worry about sorry
Haha, yah, scotchswap was a good time! Glad to see you're still cranking out reviews and I look forward to the next 800! Cheers!
Haha you've solved it for me. Thank you though!

Scotch review #317

**""Laphroaig Single Cask"" Binny's pick, 2014 PX hogshead 62.2%**

**Nose:** Thick peat, toffee, rich honeyed fruits, light fruity wine, smooth toasted wood and vanilla, all warmly balanced wow

**Taste:** Toasted wood, big medicinal peat, vanilla, standard Laphroaig notes but then it smoothly transitions to graham cracker, honey, smooth warm fruits, gritty toffee, peppery spice. Has a thick yet smooth warming mouthfeel, with lots of peat and honeyed fruit all balanced together

**Finish:** Sweet fruits build bright, strawberry and lemon, toffee, big medicinal peat, vanilla and barrel char, nice spice. A simultaneously sweet and mean charred peat finish

*******************

I always say that I'm not a big fan of sherry aged Laphroaig but this is an excellent example of how it can be done right. It's insanely well-balanced, and it gets all the full flavor of it's high 62% abv but without much heat at all. The sherry is complimenting the peaty Laphroaig spirit without being overly heavy or wine-y. It smoothly transitions between standard Laphroaig woody peat notes and lots of sweet honeyed fruits, all warm and cozy and thick and effortlessly balanced. Still a tough sell on the price, but if you are a big Laphroaig fan looking for something different these are delivering better than a lot of IB's from what I've had so far.

Love seeing all these Laph Single Casks coming out! And being opened!
When i tried this one, I was FAR from a fan. And I LOVE PX'd Laphy. As the saying goes, not everyone likes the same.
And I love drinking them!
What didn't you like about it?
It felt very gritty and astringent for my liking. No sweetness, no ashy/medicinal notes. Just...bitter. The Cairdeas was far and away superior."

**Finish:** Vanilla toasted wood, medicinal peat, builds sweetly charred and peaty with some drying tannins. It's a long complex finish of sweet toast, peat and wood

***************

What a cool Laphroaig I love it. Fine display of virgin French oak, not as heavy-handed as the t8ke r/Scotch pick I reviewed before this one. It's a perfect sweet spot of toasted wood: heavily toasted, toffee, lots of vanilla and sweetness with just a touch of drying tannins. But at the same time the French oak has a softness to it, no real spice kick or heat to it. It doesn't overwhelm the spirit, the Frog medicinal peat is still very powerful. The t8ke pick is great and wins points for it's uniqueness. I've never had such a thick chocolatey Laphroaig as that one. But this one is a little more to my liking. I need that aggressive Laphroaig peat to come through and it does it well here with a delicious French oak influence

**""Laphroaig Single Cask"" Jay West/Nick Conti pick, 2014 Virgin French Oak (Heavy Toast) 57.9%**

**Nose:** Thick and chocolatey, big medicinal peat interwoven with rich toasted oak, toffee, sweet vanilla, sweet char, fudgy chocolate, aromatic spice 

**Taste:** Big chocolatey oak and thick caramel melds with medicinal Frog peat, tons of soothing vanilla, sweet char and aromatic spice, slighty drying wood

**Finish:** Sweet toasted oak, vanilla, some slightly drying tannins, toffee, big medicinal peat. A long powerful finish of medicinal peat and thick wood

**************

Rather than dynamic and complex flavor that leaps out at you, this is more like a monolith of chocolatey oak and medicinal peat all interwoven together. It's so fudgy and thick. I've never had a Laphroaig quite like it. Signature medicinal Frog peat is there but the virgin French oak has enveloped it like a warm blanket with tons of smooth oak and vanilla. If sherry bombs are a thing, then this must be a ""Virgin French oak bomb"" because the cask is on full display here. Not what I was expecting but it's a lot of fun just for being such a unique Laphroaig. I think 10CS will still be my stalwart Laphroaig peat monster of choice but this really satisfies for the right mood.

Score: **8/10**
Very interesting. But at $250 I could buy 3 bottles of Laphroiag 10 CS
Really cool bottle, thanks for sharing!
glad you loved this! only correction - these are 8-9 rather than 6 years (2014 vintage)
Yeah, it's good but honestly these aren't worth the money unless you are a big Laphroaig fan looking for something interesting and new. 10CS is a great scotch and satisfies the Laphroaig itch just fine
Oops, bad at math apparently. This is why I don't put an age in the title if it's not on the bottle. Edited
Any chance you picked up a different single cask of similar age and different wood profile?  

A Laphroaig lover with a limitless budget could get really nerdy comparing single casks.

There's this sense of deep dark oak, smooth tannins, but also lots of sweeter toasted flavors and vanilla. It's that wall of dark oak that is complex yet smoothly balanced that I love so much in Armagnac. Just perfect. No one does oak like Armagnac does. Lots of sweet fruit comes through too and it all melds into a wave of darkly sweet fruity and oaky flavor. A classic powerful L'Encantada Armagnac done really well.

**Taste:** Light toffee, sweet rye, mint, sugary and a little nutty. Light and sweet, very well-balanced 

**Finish:** Sugary toffee, sweet rye, nutty sweetness, just a hint of herbal rye spice

If you are looking for something smooth and balanced, it pulls that off. It's decent enough but always struck me as a little boring. But sipping it tonight it has some really good sugary rye sweetness to it. Flavor-wise no real complaints, I just wish it had a bigger presence. It's surprisingly light for being 50%. All in all it's good stuff that has a nice rye sweetness, and very friendly to sip on

Would be hard not to be that anisette-guzzling monkey with this DJ bottle lol
Tried this at a bar and was totally underwhelmed! Felt 10+ proof points short and lacking in flavor.
Speaking of MGP, I just got a bottle of Old Elk. I am whelmed. 

Maybe less when I think about the price I paid. I only got the wheated and not the double.
i LOVE  this bottle, its one of my favorite low proof mgp bottles out there. Wish it didnt cost a fortune
I like that deal for a 10Y MGP. So many bottles selling for about the same price for 5-6Y MGP, it's ridiculous.
So MGP does the initial distillation, ages the distillate, and then sends to Smoke Wagon for it to be blended?
Everyone‚Äôs tastes are different of course but I‚Äôd be leery that a bar was  subbing in inferior bourbon in higher dollar bottles I f a pour of Desert Jewel was lacking in flavor to you.
Old Elk contract distills. It's their own mash bill, yeast, and barrel char. Hard to compare MGP and Old Elk,(also made at MGP).
I think smoke wagon extends the aging in nevada but someone will else will need to confirm.
I trust this place for a lot of reasons, but your point is taken. I think I had some fake Pappy 23 once‚Ä¶"

Everything here is great, on the more delicate side. Lots of sweet barley, delicate fruits, and sugary dessert notes with some faint nuttiness and butterscotch that adds an interesting counterpoint. All effortlessly balanced the way age does so well. I have found with this series that Clynelish overall seems to have a more delicate malt character, and combined with the low abv here it gives it a very light presence. I usually prefer thicker more robust malt bombs but it's nice to unwind with something gentle sometimes. I can appreciate the quality of Clynelish but it's just not the kind of malty Scotch I go for.

A lot of different flavors going on here, complexity is an understatement. The nose reminds me so much of a bruichladdich with all the wine funk. Funk hangs back on the palate and lots of sugary malt and fruits takes over. It's a wine-y red fruit at first that transitions into more of a sugary white fruit on the finish, with lots of sweet malt all the way through. All very well-balanced.

I had this one, and the same day I also had Chorlton's Cathaib (which is always clynelish).

Two let downs for me, this one being bigger than the Chorlton's (this one had almost half the age..).

Seeing ratings, I guess it's one of those hate or love it things
Nice review. I had heard that this is a divisive bottling, so it is fun to read a positive take on it.

My experience with North Star (about twenty of them so far, they are my favorite IB and I've only had 1 bad bottling from them) has been that in the middle of their price range where I normally shop one tends to encounter with some frequency these types of releases:

- refill or otherwise shy casks which are very nice and do no injustice to the distillate, but they do seem to drink at a lower level of cask influence & maturity than what one might expect from the stated age.

- casks or cask finishes which are a wee bit idiosyncratic and may take the malt off in different directions in terms of flavors. Not so strongly so as what Murray McDavid is famous for (with their oddball wine casks) but trending in that direction.

- blended malts based on old Edrington blending stocks, which typically are value priced considering what you get.

From your review this Clynelish sounds like the 2nd type (Murray McDavid-lite). Glad to hear you enjoyed it.
Great review!  I felt very differently about this one‚Äî it seemed like a potentially very divisive pour‚Äî so it was fun to read a review with a more positive reaction!
Interesting, because I didn't like it at first either. Not horrible but it was heading for a 7/10. But I warmed up to it as I drank it. Still one of the lower one in this series which has gotten a few 9/10 samples

Also maybe it's not a coincidence that it reminded me of Bruichladdich, another divisive Scotch that I love"

A big sweet malt bomb of a Scotch. I love this style so much, and this one is exceptionally sweet fruity and bright. The oak influence here is light, I would not have guessed it as first fill Bourbon at all. Something I'm realizing about Clynelish with these reviews is that it has a very clean malt character. It's sweet and light, almost delicate. I usually prefer something a little thicker and more robust for a malty Scotch. Dailuaine and Craigellachie come to mind. These samples have been fantastic, so no complaints here, but maybe that is what has put me off from a lot of other Clynelish in the past. I think maybe it just needs to be done right otherwise it can be a little boring.

I can see why K&L made sure to specify ""2nd fill sherry."" It has a healthy sherry influence. Technically it's just a refill sherry cask, but that wouldn't quite tell the whole story. It's not a sherry saturated bomb like you get on 1st fill with those overwhelming wine and sulfur notes, but also it's much heavier than just a light refill sherry. As someone who isn't always big on sherry I think this is in a really cool zone. About as close to a sherry bomb as I like to get. Super drinkable

Great Clynelish reviews. All sound great. I‚Äôm looking forward to the next 3. Did this one have any Clynelish feel to it. Sounds wonderful but was the any base spiritness to it?
Damn. This is an old label- was this from ~10 years ago?
Before clicking into your review I thought ""Oh this gonna be a good one."" Glad my intuition was correct
I mentioned it in the review I just posted, but I think Clynelish has kind of a delicate maltiness I'm finding. Delicious, very clean and sweet, but light. So I didn't get a lot of base spirit in this one. And the malty ones seem to be very sweet. Great stuff even if I usually prefer thicker malt
It's from 2019, but I think they used an older vintage style label
I got it now. So much going on with this one. It's funny you say that Clynelish has kind of a delicate maltiness. I agree with the soft maltiness but the few Clynelishes I've had recently seem kind of bland ( could be COVID residue) Nice and sweet but not really a lot going on. I remember, back in the day, what I liked about Clynelish was the soft maltiness but also some heather sweetness, mineral notes that gave it some nice body and some maritime notes.  It may be me but those notes seem to be missing as of late. The 1995, 23rd old sounds amazing. No sherry finish with this one. Sounds a lot like the 1995, 23 yr old, Single Cask Nation Clynelish I review awhile back. Rereading my notes, very similar- Cheers https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/d8vzl4/review_105_clynelish_23_year_old_single_cask/

**Clynelish 2013 7yr ""SMWS 26.176 A Sea of Sumptuosity,"" first fill bourbon 61.9%**

**Nose:** Waxy malt, toasted wood, toffee, green apple, berries, gently floral, spice

**Taste:** Viscous waxy malt, sweet bright barley, green apple, thick caramel, sweet toasted wood, vanilla, soft spice kick that brings in a little action. Big and sweet and fruity with a thick mouthfeel, yum yum

**Finish:** Big sweet barley kick, caramel green apple, sweet wood, vanilla, floral, sweet fruits. Long sweet malty finish

******************

This is pretty impressive at 7 years. All the bright malty and fruity notes of the barley at it's young age, and lots of sweet cask notes without the heavy oak you might get with first fill Bourbon. And this is that waxy Clynelish malt they are always talking about. I had to doublecheck the abv because there is no heat at all for being 60%+. Just delivers tons of big flavor with a thick mouthfeel. Excellent malt bomb. I like this better than the 20yr Signatory I reviewed previously.

Score: **9/10**
Impressive score for something at 7 years! Had a couple of these young Clynelishes and so far they haven't left a strong impression.
Nice that's kind of a miracle. Every young Clynelish (and for young I mean below 10yo) has always been a delusional experience for me. Hardly ever giving hints of waxy and being just an unfinished malty and unripe apricot, I can put the Chorlton Cathaib or the Northstar Lynch Isle in too, or a few 8/9yo from The Ultimate.. also I believe it's best for the distillery to die in Bourbon.

I have opened a Carnations on the coast (26.213), that ticks almost all the boxes, and fits this one by your description.
Yeah same, hence this series of reviews. @Mercc didn't like that I'm not a big fan of the distillery so he sent me all this stuff to try and remedy it haha
The through line for all those bottlers you listed as not liking are relatively newer bottlers who might not get first access to the best casks from Clynelish (i've not enjoyed the North Star Clynelishs i've had either). 

Whereas I'd imagine SMWS having bottled Clynelish since the mid '80s might get a better pick of casks.
yeah sure SMWS/GM/Adelphi have an hold of better casks. Yet sometimes SMWS I still wonder if they go into some kind of jeopardize mode, as soon as they see the ABV in their casks is approaching 60% and thus ""it must be bottled immediately"".  


They recently churned out a few 7yo 67/68% Ben nevis or other stuff beyond 64 that is still extremely young (and that could stay in the cask for longer..) so when I saw a 7yo Clynelish, I was kind of surprised by the good review.
I stopped being a member of SMWS when the age and quality dropped off and cask finishes became more common, BUT, the young Nevis that Thompson Bros have released I've really really liked for the texture and umami notes they offer. 

Likewise these young Clynelish indies in first or refill bourbon I've quite enjoyed because I love the naked spirit.
I utilize SMWS mostly because it's.. well basically the only way to grab some weird stuff like bourbon Glenfarclas or Glendronach.. one if not the last source of a few distilleries that are basically MIA almost anywhere, or that none bottles.

&#x200B;

But yeah, I don't understand why they have to bottle so much stuff and so much young and at such needlessly nigh ABV.
I'd say the financial benefit for them has been enormous over the last 10 years with going for quantity over quality. Being able to pump out young, cask-finished stuff would surely be the highest margin.
Yeah.. however now basically anyone else has to do the same. Young stuff, more often than not, is quite awful and prices are through the roof anyway."

Scotch review #309

***********

**Clynelish 1996 20yr ""Signatory"" refill sherry butt, 56.3%**

**Nose:** Toasted and biscuity, butterscotch, caramel, undercurrent of smooth dirty fruits, caramel raisin, berry, figs

**Taste:** Caramel, toasted biscuity malt, toffee, syrupy mouthfeel, sweet caramel-covered strawberry, mild herbal spice. Nice mouthfeel, cohesive, the flavor flows beautifully

**Finish:** Sticky-sweet caramel and toasted biscuity malt, sweet fruity strawberry, mild spice, a big pleasant finish that is just so Scotchy

**************

Ok this just oozes quality. Really nice mouthfeel and the flavor pours over the palate. I love the sticky-thick toffee and toasted biscuity malt, it's not your typical sweet barley forward maltiness. The refill sherry does exactly what I like refill sherry to do, complimenting the flavor without taking over. This is one of those casks that tastes more like a well-balanced OB than some wild and crazy single barrel

Score: **8/10**
I love this bottle. I‚Äôve got a little less than half of mine left. The mouthfeel is fantastic. Also, agree no waxiness. 

I poured it blind for some friends and no one guessed Clynelish but they all really liked it at the same time. But if you pour it side by side with the 14, you can still pick up the spirit. 

Pretty well cooked in sherry but they bottled it at just the right time. Even one more year in cask would‚Äôve drowned it, IMHO.
No waxiness?
[I really liked this one too, and I also didn't pick up waxiness](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/9r3kw3/review_415_clynelish_20_signatory_cs/)
Nope, no waxiness on this one. Maybe because it had more of the toasted and biscuity thing going on"
"Review #784: Russell's Reserve 13 year, 57.4%",,https://i.redd.it/hyxza102i2wb1.jpg,"13 years old and bottled at Barrel Proof, a rare treat from Wild Turkey. I believe this is a 2022 batch. Purchased for $100

American Whiskey review #286

*******************

**Russell's Reserve 13 year, 57.4%**

**Nose:** Rich dark toasted oak, woody caramel, leather, vanilla, subtle berry, chocolate. Layers of smooth warm oakiness

**Taste:** Big toasted oak, woody caramel, vanilla, smooth tannins, warm sweet corn, mellow wood spice, slightly drying, tobacco. All these complex wood notes meld smoothly, creates this chocolatey-rich oakiness that has just the right amount of drying tannins

**Finish:** Toasted oak, building wood spice, vanilla, just slightly drying as it trails off. Long and rich oaky finish

***************

Great stuff, and it's a profile you just don't see a whole lot. No one does oak like Wild Turkey and they are really showing off what they can do here. It's big and oaky but feels so well-crafted. Much more than just a simple case of ""older equals better, so here have some oak."" There are plenty of other Bourbons out there at a similar age that cannot begin to pull this off so well. Not exactly a callback to classic dusty Turkey either, it has that barrel proof intensity that still gives it a modern feel. Delicious stuff, very well done.

Score: **8/10**
Fun! You didn't mention any nitpicks - what's holding this back from a 9 or even higher? 

I picked up the latest batch today, excited to try it out!
$250 secondary all day in my area. Sucks because it‚Äôs beyond my threshold for secondary vs MSRP but I‚Äôd love to snag one.
Batch-2 wasn't that good, love batches 3&4, MSRP is now $150 and still a good value in my opinion.

One of very few WT products I enjoy. Good review
Great review üëèüèæ
I struggled with the score on this one. Honestly, its probably worthy of a 9/10. But 8 just felt right for me. It's maybe a tad quiet, a little closed off. I think that's more just the nature of the drier wood notes and not necessarily a bad thing though.
$4-500 here üôÉ
I wish it was only $250 by me. I'd actually be tempted to get it.
I thought Batch 2 was excellent. It was flavorful (sweet oak, dark fruit, vanilla, and creamy mouthfeel. I have had several tastings and have never gotten a negative response by anyone. I just found the Batch 5 (LL/LE), but maybe Batch 4 based on your comment from the distillery. Looking forward to cracking it open to compare against Batch 2.
Do you have the lazer codes by batch? Or is that something I can find on rarebied101?
I just stumbled on a bottle of Batch 5 today for $150. I didn't realize it was now the MSRP. I just saw it selling for $299 at another place which is pretty much what I've seen it for in the past so I grabbed it at that price.  Can't wait to crack it open.
Keep the RR13. I haven't actually had EC18 myself, but I've heard a lot that it's overrated. That it's basically just oaky and thin at 45%
No way.
I really wasn‚Äôt a fan of WT stuff till I found a batch 3 RR13, and fell in love. Went and bought a store pick that‚Äôs iv been contemplating on getting for some time now. Glad I did before they were all gone. It‚Äôs a great replacement for RR13.
This one for me is an easy 9. If that isn't a 9, I don't know what would be. But, everyone's opinions are different of course. Nice review!
Judging by the pic, if this is freshly opened, it‚Äôs going to develop as you get into the bottle. Might be a solid 9 in a month or two, if it‚Äôs borderline now
Please respond back here or post a review when you do (or dm me). I had batch 3 and thought it was too tannic and dark.  I swapped for a batch 2, loved it, and bought a backup.  Everyone else in my group (including the guy who swapped bottles with me) dislikes batch 2.  I‚Äôve heard batch 5 is really, really good and have considered swapping my backup for it.

American Whiskey review #285

******************************

**Four Roses ""Small Batch"" Limited Edition 2022, 54.5%**

**Nose:** Sweet corn, cherry, clean toasted oak, slight mustiness, gentle floral notes, caramel, light zingy spice, almost a butterscotch creaminess. Creamy and fruity and sweet, just delightful. Has a clean and crystal-clear quality to it

**Taste:** Cherry candy, clean corn, rich caramel, sweet floral notes, clean lightly toasted oak, vanilla. Again it has such a clean mouthfeel. Surprisingly for the age it's not super oaky, it's more of the fruity sweet and floral notes on display. It feels happy and clean more than it feels ""old.""

**Finish:** Floral notes and light cinnamon spice build, cherry, creamy caramel. A fruity sweet finish with just a touch of cinnamon spice tingle

*************************

A celebration of the sweet fruity aspects of Four Roses Bourbon. I understand now why this is labeled as a Small Batch LE. It really goes for the balance of a Small Batch product. It doesn't have the big action-packed floral/spice kick I often associate with the single barrels, and it's not super oaky despite the hefty ages of the components. Lots of fruitiness and sweetness, but it stops just short of being ""bright."" Still has a really nice caramel richness to it. Just delightful.

My only other experience with Four Roses SmB LE is a tasting I did a few years ago of three or four different batches. My first impression is that this doesn't quite measure up to some of the better ones in there, but that feels nitpicky because this stuff is delicious.

Score: **8/10**
Absolutely agree with this review. Bought the same batch a couple months ago and have poured it 3-4 times thus far. It can come across as closed off, but there's a subtlety and complexity to it that I rarely get in bourbon. Kinda comes across like a good single malt or single pot still in that sense.
Can you adjust your scoring so that you have something below 7 some times?
I would agree this doesn‚Äôt stand up against most of the other batches of smble that I have had. It was good but I did not seek out a bottle of it after having it on a couple of occasions.
can you even get these anymore?

about a decade ago, I used to get them but gave up after awhile.
Great review! this bottle is worth a 10/10 score. fantastic!
That wouldn't take an adjustment of my scoring so much as an adjustment of what I drink. I have been doing this long enough that I have a pretty good idea of what's good out there and what kind of stuff I will like. So I tend to only review quality stuff, mainly in the 7-9 range. I could branch out and do more middling/lesser stuff just for the fun of reviewing them, but I'm busy enough with the samples and bottles I have already"

Brandy review #154

********************

**Grosperrin Bas-Armagnac ""Zn09 Samurai"" 1996 27yr, 52%**

**Nose:** Dark toasted wood, caramel, vanilla, soy sauce, chocolate, plum, red berries.

**Taste:** Rich caramel, smooth toasted wood, vanilla, graham cracker, soy sauce, plum, chocolatey grape. Thick oily mouthfeel, big flavor that flows smoothly

**Finish:** Toffee, citrus fruits, soy sauce, graham cracker, settles into chocolatey grape and soy sauce, mellow minty spice

************

This is excellent and I definitely see the similarities with the afish 96. It has that same strong yet well-integrated soy sauce note. It melds in with the toffee and vanilla wood notes and fruits, gives it some amazing personality without being overbearing. Like the afish 96, it has a thick oily and balanced mouthfeel. This one is slightly darker, more vanilla and wood, tamer overall. Afish 96 is more bright and sweet in comparison, gives it a nice pop. Afish 96 still wins the day but damn this stuff is fantastic and satisfies a very similar itch

**Rounagle 1984 38yr, 52%**

**Nose:** Smooth dark oak, sweetly toasted, just a hint of tannins, jammy fruits, grape, lots of vanilla. Sweet and woody, smoothly balanced

**Taste:** Sweet toasted oak, toasted marshmallow, caramel, fruity grape, vanilla, some dry tannic wood smoothly integrated. Lighter mouthfeel

**Finish:** More dry tannic wood creeps in, toasted oak, sweet vanilla, fruity grape

***********

Hits all the hallmark notes I love in old Armagnac. Deep toasted wood, slightly dry and tannic but lots of sweetness and vanilla too, caramel, plenty of fruit. Everything is there but it's lacking a little oomph. Drank blind I might not believe it was 52%, drinks more like 45%. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's delicious just has a lighter mouthfeel

Score: **7/10**

*************

**Giboin Cognac 2002 Aficionados pick, 52.6%**

**Nose:** Heavily toasted wood, rich caramel, mellow wood spice, vanilla, black cherry, menthol.

**Taste:** Oh yeah that's the stuff. Heavily toasted wood, vanilla, rich warming caramel, just a touch of darker tannins, woody cherry, warm fruity grape, mellow wood spice. It's the kind of stuff that is delicious but not in a complex way, the flavor just oozes along warm and satisfying. Lands just right

**Finish:** Flavor continues into the finish, toasted wood, vanilla, toffee, spice builds but stays mellow and lingers with sweet woody cherry

****************

Now this is some satisfying stuff. It's Woody but in a toasted and caramel-heavy way, nothing too tannic or or challenging here. It's the kind of stuff that reminds me of dusty Wild Turkey where it just seems to capture that perfect heavy wood essence but in a smooth and drinkable way. Actually it almost drinks like an Armagnac, it doesn't have that dry Cognac woodiness at all. But it does have that Cognac smoothness. I keep using the word ""satisfying"" here but it really does apply well.

**Finish:** Orange caramel, smooth toasted oak, cherry and mint, building rye spice

****************

Wow these are special. I'm a huge fan of MGP 95/5 rye and these older SAOS picks are some of the best there's ever been. There's a rawness to Single Casks a lot of times, even when they are great. But this feels incredibly cohesive and balanced like a perfectly finished product. It's more than just a single cask that happens to tastes good, it's a true gem. These days, even paying big bucks for MGP rye picks of a similar age they just don't have this level of quality. Where have all these great casks gone? I might actually pay $200 for a 9yr NBC pick if it delivered this kind of quality. But they just don't, not even close. I will say though, just to be a little picky, I wish this one had stronger rye flavor to it. It's so cohesive that the rye kind of blends in. I prefer a little more ""pop"" and mintiness to my rye grain. But it's a minor complaint, more just a personal preference. This is basically a perfect Whiskey

Thanks for keeping ‚Äòem coming Bucky ü•É
These bottles are near 10 for me. Absolutely love them, and wish there were more 9+ year bottles to be had. Recently had a pour of a 12 year SAOS rye, and I think the 9-10 year was the sweet spot (although, the 12 was pretty damn tasty).
I have been a collector of Smooth Ambler for a while. And I had a long run of awesome bottles bottled by Sarah. I liked that touch.
I passed on a 5 Year SAOS SiB today.  Wondering if that was a mistake...
I'm new here -- can someone tell me what these little bottles are / where they come from? I'm trying to find my palette and I don't want to buy full 750s just to find out I don't like something.
I was never fortunate enough to try one of these single barrels, but, soon after I began getting into bourbon, etc, I had one of the standard 7 year, 99 proof ryes.  I loved it and bought more before they disappeared.

Each time I opened one over the subsequent years (I have a single one left - Sarah Dec 2014) I figured that it wouldn't be as good as I remembered.  I've always been wrong.

I've tried pretty much every rye I can get in VA, most way more expensive than the OS, but nothing has even come very close.

Do you have any recommendations for this OS rye fan?   I've been afraid to open my last one!

An aside:  I also placed my first online order for two super low-proof barrel strength OS bourbons back in the day.  The 90-something proof one was out of this world.  Again, haven't had anything like it since.
the mid 2010s were truly a special time for mgp
I got a store pick of it from my local place recently and the manager was raving about it. I agree, it was fantastic. Tonight I just finished a bottle of Smooth Ambler Contradiction, which is Old Scout mixed with their in-house distilled 2 year old wheated bourbon and then re-barreled and aged a few more months. It was good, but honestly the Old Scout is better on its own. Your review has me ready to go pick up another bottle tomorrow. GG.
What is the price?
I'll do my part as long as people share samples with me haha
You can't buy the whiskey samples anywhere unfortunately. Many people just use these small bottles to trade samples from their collection among friends. The bottles are called Boston Rounds, usually 1oz or 2oz sizes
The Smooth Ambler Rye was all Indiana distilled MGP with a 95/5 Rye/Barley mashbill. So keep an eye out for that stuff. But honestly most of it today isn't as good as that stuff was, but you still find some great barrels. Sign up for t8ke's newsletter in r/Bourbon, he does some good MGP rye picks now and then. The Dancing Goat and Belle of Bedford especially has been great. Nashville Barrel Company too. 

WhistlePig Single Barrels can be great too, but again not as good as they used to be. T8ke has picked some good ones of those. New Riff is doing some great stuff, and I hear Wilderness Trail is too but I haven't tried it myself. 

Best Rye I've had these days is Jack Daniels Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye. It's hard to find but if you are able to, grab some
I don't remember exactly. I think back in the early/mid 2010's when these were available they were under $100
Thanks.  Will do.  I knew it was just mgp 95/5, but the 6 or so bottles I've had were simply head and shoulders above anything else from the same source.  Basically don't even taste like the same product.  Who knows...
Yeah I wish I had a better answer, but it's hard to match that old stuff. I'm constantly hunting for the next great rye and I have mixed results"

**Taste:** Bright orange and caramel, hot lively spice, sweet toasted wood, apricot, sweet fruits. Just a tad too hot, so I added water. Really transforms it. Calms it all down, the fruits really come alive and there's thick caramel and even some creamy notes. Cherry, sugary fruits, caramel, butterscotch, sweet wood

**Finish:** Big bright fruit and spice, butterscotch, orange

**********************

It's a hot one that's for sure. Bright fruits and warm caramel wood notes accompanied by a significant spice kick. It's just a little too hot so I decided it needed some water which I don't normally do and wow what a difference. Just a little water really elevates this stuff and turns it into a super approachable fruit and caramel bomb. The spice is gone and all the warm fruity notes I loved come alive without feeling thin or watered down at all. Water almost needs to be mandatory for this

**Nose:** Big creamy and malty, buttercream, thick cereal malt, a sharp briny edge that is just delicious, balanced campbeltown funk, hay, faint green apple, mild herbs. Just beautiful. Thick and creamy and balanced with that briny funky edge

**Taste:** Thick sugary malt coats the mouth, thick and buttery, robust malt, cereal, sugary barley, butterscotch, faint musty wood, delicious briny edge rises up smoothly, all intertwined with just enough smoky funk to give it that Kilkerran character but without stealing the show. It's freaking delicious

**Finish:** Barley sugar, sweet malt, smoky briny funk that smoothly melds, some peppery spice to remind you that you are drinking a Whisky after all and not some Barley dessert that you picked up out of the ocean

******************

I am continually blown away by Bourbon cask Kilkerran. It's an amazing malt bomb (a style which I am a huge fan of), but at the same time it has so much distinct funky character to it. I'm pretty sure I could identify this as a Kilkerran blind. But it balances these elements extremely well, it satisfies on both fronts. Excellent base spirit, excellent aging, and excellent blending have all gone into this bottling and ye gods does the quality show. It is a work of art. It's unfortunate how hyped these guys and Springbank have become. How expensive and difficult to find it is these days. But I feel that it is deserved, which is more than I can say for a lot of the Bourbon madness out there. This is an easy high scorer

Really liked this bottle! What are your thoughts on the sherry version?
The bourbon casks to my mind were always best. I was stoked when they brought them back. Sadly was only able to  get the sherry
For years and years I heard of this and springbank but never seen them anywhere to buy. Literally nowhere not even duty free in London. Just heard that Cambeltown was it‚Äôs own taste profile and that they  are the only ones to grow their own barely. 

Now they are available everywhere but far too marked up in price to buy. Guess I‚Äôll have to wait to get to try one.
I entered a lottery for a chance to buy this and they 8 year sherry .. not getting my hopes up
Just spotted this for 87,50 USD / 80,40 EUR including tax at an online store. Sounds like a decent purchase.
Great review.  I have also been enjoying this release and think your notes capture it well.
How does this compare to the most recent heavily peated KK batches ( 7 and 8), which were both mostly bourbon matured. Just curious,  because I have batch 6, 7, and 8 of the Heavily peated,  but have never had the chance to get this bottle.  I have my eyes on one,  but it's more than I wanted to spend for it.
What did it taste like for you?
Wow the port was excellent imo
I mean that's a good one too but I get pretty excited about Bourbon barrel kilkerran
I haven't had a recent one but it looks like I reviewed the 2019 and 2021 sherry

They are my favorite too. Haven't had one since a Work in Progress bourbon cask years ago and this one holds up to how good I remember that one being
The Local Barley series from Springbank is the only one with locally grown barley, but Cambletown definitely has a uniqueness to it.
Kilkerran 12 seems to be one of the easiest to find bottles, that might be a good entry point
I have this KK8 and HP batch 7.  Let's get the obvious out of the way first.  HP is much heavier on the peat.  The peat level on core Kilkerran is basically the same as Springbank.  The HP is more heavily peated than Ardbeg.  I don't know exactly the cut point Glen Gyl use for both, but typically heavily peated malt cut points will go deeper towards the feints to capture the heavier phenols.  To me the HP7 has a bit of a heavier brine note bordering on parmesan. This KK8CS is pretty clean in that regard.  More malt forward with the fruit and smoke playing supporting roles.  They feel like they're from the same distillery though.
Sorry, I haven't tried any Kilkerran heavily peated yet
Just harsh. I couldn‚Äôt pick up much else
I tried to like it, between swapping samples and my own drams the bottle is probably 2/3 gone, I just can't get into it. And I've generally enjoyed a lot of other peat+port offerings.

As an aside for the Canadians there's a TWAxMoonbroch Secret Islay 10yo that's port matured still available in Alberta, that's an awesome bottle.
Thanks for your thoughts! It's so weird to hear you say that the HP is more heavily peated than ardbeg.  I've heard that,  and it just blows my mind.  I know that ppm is not really a good way to measure peatiness in the final product,  but KKHP is just not super peaty to me.  More so than regular KK but feels less peaty than even a talisker to me.
Oh damn,  alright. I've heard this bottle smashes the   sherry matured version and I'm excited about finding one ( the 8 y/o bourbon cask)
That's interesting. Thanks.

What are your favorite malts?
Did you add some water?
Of course another side of production at Springbank goes like ""how many ppm is Longrow?"" ""48 hours of peat worth""
I was talking about malt measured ppm, not distillate.  I did have a bit side by side with a bit of Ardbeg BizarreBQ the other day as I was writing up some notes and in that context I thought Longrow and KK HP reduced to 46% were pretty similar to the Ardbeg in smoke volume though different in character.  It stikes me as much peatier that Talisker while core Kilkerran is a bit less peaty to me. We're all a bit different in our perception.  I mostly drink unpeated to moderately peated malts in summer and usually don't go for more heavily peated stuff in other seasons more than once or twice a week.
Mainly sherry heavy varieties. I‚Äôm not into peat.
Yes. A couple of drops and I let it sit for 10mins. I just don‚Äôt think Campbelltown is my thing. Victoriana being the exception.
There was also a sherry matured 8 released shortly before this.  If you get the chance to try that you might find it more to your liking"

Eager to try both and they were released together so just thought I would make a double review out of it. Both are going for just under $100

Brandy reviews #149/150

************************

**Grosperrin Truau Bas-Armagnac 1996 27yr #C/F5, 55.5%**

**Nose:**Toasted wood, vanilla, mildly tannic, black tea, caramel, black cherry, menthol spice.

**Taste:** Dark toasted wood, heavy vanilla, syrupy dark cherry, caramel, healthy dose of spice heat, dark tannins. 

**Finish:** Gritty dark wood, black tea, vanilla, tannins, dark black cherry

A nice darker flavored Armagnac with a fair amount of spice heat but it stays balanced. With the dark flavor and heavy spice it almost reminds me of a ""Pouchegu lite."" It's in that similar style but not as heavy-hitting.

**7.5/10**

************************************

**Grosperrin Truau Bas-Armagnac 1993 30yr #C/C13, 53.3%**

**Nose:** Toasted wood, tannic and slightly sour, black tea, vanilla, caramel, raspberry, menthol

**Taste:** Tannic wood, toasted vanilla, tart berry, caramel, black tea, slight sour note

**Finish:** Tannic wood, vanilla, , tart berry, lingering soft spice

Good stuff. Mostly it's a standard kind of dark wood, vanilla and tart berry profile. Feels measured and not too hot for 53%. Dark tannic wood has some black tea and sour type notes to it that could possibly turn some people off but it's subtle and I think it actually adds some interesting character to it. 

**7/10**

************************************

**Final Thoughts:** I like these, not quite mind blowing or anything but they are totally solid Armagnacs and well worth the price. Both are darker and lean on the woodier side with dark tart fruits. Similar wood notes with a little twang to them. 1993 is is a little more smooth and balanced, with warmer wood notes. 1996 is just a touch darker, it's bolder flavor and more punchy. 1996 is my favorite of the 2 but they both have their strengths.
Was seriously considering these until I overspent at auction recently. Good drams coming regardless but I'm glad these got featured
More great reviews man, thank you for taking the time. I've been looking at these and you've just bumped them up the list.

I was just wondering though, when you say tannins are they similar to the acrid tannins sometimes found in red wine? Because those notes tend to detract points from an armagnac for me
I've never been a wine person so unfortunately I can't say how related the notes might be. But yeah that sounds similar. I would describe tannic as the more bitter or dry aspect of the barrel, as opposed to the sweet toasted vanilla. I wouldn't worry about it too much here though it's not too strong. I think most Armagnac at this age has some degree of tannic woodiness but it's usually pretty well-balanced and adds to the overall complexity IMO
Ah okay thank you for replying man, I've never been a wine person either so wine-like notes stand out to me. Coffee and dark chocolate-ish tannins can definitely be a positive, the Afish Grosperrin 1996 really stands out on that front imo.

Sorry to ask, but are there any really fruit-forward cask strength brandies you'd recommend?
No worries! Have you had much Cognac or Calvados? If you are looking for less and wood and more fruit that might be the way to go. There are some afish pick Giboins on FineDrams right now, I haven't had them yet but they might fit that bill. Grosperrin bottlings are fantastic, some are woody but many are more bright and fruity. 

And Calvados of course is very apple/pear forward. Pretty much any entry level bottle from Lemorton, Breuil, Camut, or Groult are fine. Don't be worried about the 40-42% abv, Calvados does very well at this strength
I've dabbled a bit with cognac but not enough to really form an opinion of the style, I've had the 2001 Giboin which has an interesting mushroomy rancio with some dark fruit notes. Thanks for the recommendation! Honestly I'm still chasing after something like the Grosperrin 1996

Looks like Calvados is well worth a shot, thanks again for all the help man"

**Finish:** Toasted wood and cherry, lots of pleasant Bourbony spice, just a hint of oaky tannic bite, cherry menthol

***********************

Nose was too hot at first, had me kind of worried. But luckily it's not so harsh on the palate and the nose calms down with some (significant) air time. Boy it's another action-packed Pibous though. Lots of spice kick and syrupy-sweet cherry and wood. The creamy butterscotch type notes were a surprise and added a nice layer of complexity to what could have been a hot mess. But it's all held together somehow. Maybe a little rough around the edges compared to older Pibous I've had but it's still delicious with sweetness and spice that attacks

**Taste:** After the peaty nose, taste is much much softer. Soft fuzzy peat, ash, brine, bready and a little funky, petrol, lemon, delicate stonefruit. It's all very soft and quiet, it's good but the mouthfeel is just a little too light

**Finish:** Picks up some more body on the finish, soft creamy peat, ash, pepper, bready malt, hay, a little 

***************************

It definitely shows it's age. Soft and reserved, it's actually just a little too light. I've had similar abv stuff with a much thicker mouthfeel. The nose is fantastic and you are expecting big clean briny and fruity Laphroaig, but then the taste doesn't quite live up to it. The flavor that is there is good though no real complaints. It might be nice for a mild easy-sipping peat. But overall I enjoyed the 10yr much more than this.

Score: **7/10**
Just wanted to say thanks for doing this review series. Been waiting for this particular review to see if I want to snag a bottle. Thinking I'll snag the Bunna 14 instead. Cheers!
Can‚Äôt go wrong at that price for a 22yr Laphroaig
Thoughts compared to the K&L Thompson Brother‚Äôs Laphroaig you reviewed last year? Not even in the same league?
They just dropped the price to $262 and I‚Äôm getting a bottle shipped down to me in San Diego.
Sure thing, it's always fun! That bunna was good, also the glengoyne and HP for the malty scotches. Arran 9 was probably my favorite but it sold out quick unfortunately. And my favorite peat was Frog 10 and Caol Ila 8
Yeah that was the 1989 31yr. The Thompson bros was much better. A little hard to compare because it was also much more woody and peaty. This 22yr is a sweeter fruitier style. But age doesn't tell the whole story because this 22yr is much more subdued than that 31yr
Sorry, not clear,  Is the one last year much better or is this one superior?"

**Taste:** Medicinal peat and brine cuts through cleanly, sugary pastry, vanilla custard, ashy char, bright fruits. Spirit forward in a sweet and fruity way with lots of peat and brine.

**Finish:** Slightly meaner on the finish with cutting medicinal peat and ashy char, peppery spice, still some sweet sugary notes

********************

A really nice refill Laphroaig. The wood influence is light as you can tell right away from the pale color, and the delicious spirit character comes through clean and sharp. Clean raw peat, brine, sweet and fruity. The standard 10 Cask Strength by comparison is big on wood and vanilla flavors. I probably still prefer the 10CS for my tastes, but this is different enough of a profile to have it's own thing going on. I'm a big fan of Laphroaig and this is dang good stuff

Score: **8/10**
I always wonder how this bottlings differ from the standard ones. Think I‚Äôll need to try myself to find out :D
Custard and peat together is one of my favourite combos, sounds fantastic
That sounds awesome.
Sounds stellar!
Great review.  This is really like the antithesis of the 10cs.  Laphroaig laid bare.  I've enjoyed their Taliskers of similar style too."

**Ardmore(unpeated) 1997 25yr ""Old Particular"" K&L pick, refill hogshead 53.3%**

**Nose:** Oak, hot spice, herbal, burnt cream, smoke funk, cereal malt, menthol, slight fruit. Fair amount of oak, surprisingly hot and spicy. Some water calms it down and brings out more sweet creamy notes

**Taste:** Oak, buttery wood, smoke funk, slight astringency, cereal malt, butter cream, just a very slight fruitiness. Woody and vaguely malty with slight smoke. It's pretty hot and a little astringent. Water calms it down, brings out more sweet sugary cream. Feels delicate but not overly watered down

**Finish:** Cereal malt, burnt cream, wood, lots of spice. Water calms it down and makes it sweeter but there's a slight sourness

*************

Not bad but it's lacking some character. Oaky(but not over-oaked) with a straightforward maltiness. Even though it is listed as unpeated it seems to have a slight smoke funk to it. Surprisingly hot at 53% which might be the oak spice. DavidOG of K&L often comments around here that we need to add more water to these, so I tried it here and to his credit it helps a lot with this one. Calms down the spice and brings some sweeter notes out. I still find the malt character to be a little boring, could use more fruit or body or something. But it's a lot better with water and a pretty decent Scotch. I think if you are a fan of oak and spice you will like this more, I tend to look for stronger malt character. 

Score: **7/10**
Great review - any plans on doing the Laphroaig?
Great review. Sounds really good. You're killing me though. I can't taste any caramel or  vanilla.....yet.
Thanks for the review! I shortlisted this recently but maybe not anymore.
Thanks! I just posted the Laphroaig 10yr, and I'll be finishing the series up with the 22yr soon
Damn dude I'm sorry. Hang in there, drink stuff that you can still enjoy, and keep testing your palate. It should come back in time"

**""Four Roses Single Barrel"" Bevmo OBSO 10yr 6mo, 54.6%**

**Nose:** Toasted oak, musty wood, vanilla, orange, metallic, caramel, minty spice. Fruity and minty

**Taste:** Toasted oak, stale musty wood, metallic, orange, caramel, zingy spice and cherry, mint. It's a bit tame, and there's a just little too much of that musty wet wood type note. But it's not overwhelming and overall it's a nice fruity Bourbon

**Finish:** Zingy spice and caramel, cherry, corn, layer of minty spice rides out and lingers

**********************

Not a stunner of a barrel but it's a fine Bourbon. It's what I would generally consider the lower bar for these but luckily that's still pretty good. It feels a little too tame and that stale wood note holds it back a bit, but nothing too bad. I keep going back and forth on just how much I like it though, it's a tricky one to score. I think that first sip is a letdown but you then you acclimate to the stale wood note and there's some good stuff going on. Has it's flaws but it's a decent bright fruity and minty Bourbon with a delicious nose and a nice finish so I'll err on the higher side:

Score: **7/10**
how ya'll find these SBBS four roses? they're exclusively store picks right?
Nice review.  Hopefully she opens up a bit more since you seem to have just gotten past the neck.  I have gotten that musty note before, and I associate it with age...so for me it's a plus.
Yes, each bottling is exclusive to the store that picked it. They have become very sought after and harder to find in recent years unfortunately, so it takes a little more work and maybe some luck
I know what you mean and it's a fine line. I've had musty old wood notes that are good in other Bourbons. This was more of a wet or stale mustiness, just a little off-putting at first"

Just lovely stuff. Very woody but not a tannic or balsamic oak like you might get from this age. It's dark and toasted but also lots of fresh wood and caramel type notes, with a touch of tannic leather and just the right amount of dark fruits. It's very complex compared to the 2001 I had before this, which was more a dark wave of heavy vanilla and fruits. Big mouthfeel at the abv but still very cohesive and balanced.

All the darkness you crave in an Armagnac but presented in this light and crushable package. It's so easy drinking but doesn't skimp out on flavor. Hits this nice balance of rich dark wood with a touch of drying tannins, and tons of thick vanilla that smooths it all out. And none of it overpowers the fruits.

I'm a big fan of the style and it can be hard to pull off well, so I'm thrilled.

I just read K&L's notes and they mention peat in this. I didn't notice any, but I wasn't really looking for it. I did note some brine and ""grittiness"" to it, maybe that was a little bit of peat character coming through? Honestly though no smoke jumped out at me.

Great series of reviews, bucky!

I recently worked my way through a bottle of the Glengoyne 15. You absolutely nailed your description of it.

Do you have a preference b/w this Bunna and the HP? I do love me some malty HP (still dream about the thomson bros HP that K&L had a few years back), but haven't had a lot of IB Bunna so am curious.
[deleted]
Yeah exactly, I thought it was cool because bunna tends to be sherried so much. And it did well. Malty scotch can be a difficult style to pull off well. The malt has to stand up on it's own and stay balanced with the wood without a bunch of wine or peat to hide behind
Thanks! It's always good to hear when my notes connect with someone else's experience.

I don't recall either one of those two jumping out as massively better than the other, and looking back at my notes they both sound really good. HP sounds a little more malty and sweet/floral, which is usually more my preference. But the Bunna sounds really good too with the fruitiness and briny edge

Such a strange one, I think I only tried a pour the night I brought it home. Reminds me more of some of the rums I own than the other scotch I have. The barrel must‚Äôve leaked badly and oxidized the whisky to get that color from 9yrs in a bourbon barrel. A fortuitous accident! Glad so many people are liking it, wasn‚Äôt sure since it doesn‚Äôt fit into the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù scotch categories we‚Äôre used to, I knew I should‚Äôve gotten 2!

Like nothing I've ever had. I hate to say it because I know this sounds wrong, but this is like if Fireball were good. So much cherry candy and cinnamon. The cherry bitters is up front but it somehow melds really well with the rye without anything being too overpowering. I've had plenty of wine finished rye before and I would say this is a stronger influence than most I've had, which would usually put me off. But it just works really well here. TBH I'm not really even sure what cherry bitters are or how a cask is involved. It's delicious and a whole lot of fun. And egads that price, $60 for a 7yr MGP rye single cask is insane 

It almost feels wrong scoring this conventionally because it doesn't even drink like a Whiskey. But I have to rate it high based on sheer enjoyment level

Score: **9/10**
Loved this one! Sometimes I feel it's a waste to put it in a Manhattan, but the flavor still really shines through. Picked up the orange bitters finish one too, can't wait to crack it. These picks are so unique.
Very nice review. Ive been slowly enjoying my bottle, wanting this to last. A great selection by u/t8ke.
My friend, I missed your reviews :) this sounds soo good !
My local liquor store has a similar store pick, and it's delicious.  They sell it for $48, which is a steal.  I'll have to compare tasting notes next time I buy one.
Love this one
I love this review so much. Thank you.
‚ÄúIf fireball was good‚Äù
These are fantastic for cocktails. I have the Cherry and Orange and I agree they make a great Manhattan. Try it with 1 oz Cherry and 1 oz Orange. I use 1 oz of Antica and a couple dashes of Angostura bitters. Its incredible.
Thanks, and I missed reviewing!
Me too!
I'll have to give that a try!"

Scotch review #301

***************

**Caol Ila 2014 8yr ""Old Particular"" K&L pick, ex-bourbon 55.5%**

**Nose:** Big peat, bbq meat, brine, petrol, lemon, custard, vanilla, ashy char, peppery spice. Big and peaty but smoothly balanced

**Taste:** Sharp biting peat, almost medicinal, toasted wood, sweet barley, lemon, ashy char, big blast of peppery spice. Straightforward Islay peat monster, the kind of Caol Ila I love. It's big and mean and meaty but it's balanced, not overly hot.

**Finish:** Spice, big peat, vanilla, ashy char, lemon, sweet barley

******************

Classic Caol Ila, the workhorse of Islay peat that I'm used to. Easily my favorite of the two Old Particulars at K&L right now. These can get more sweet and creamy sometimes, but this one is a mean peat. There's even some almost medicinal notes in there. But overall just a classic peaty Caol Ila

Score: **8/10**
Hey, ease up dude. I haven't caught up with all of your review. Glad you're feeling better - obviously ; ), cool.
How come IB Caol Ilas tend to have higher review scores than OB? Is it only because ABV and non-chill filtaration?
I enjoyed this one when I had it - I really love the Hart Bros. 10 myself.
The Hart Bros 10yr is definitely the sweet and creamy kind. I like it but don‚Äôt love it. Looking forward to trying this one! Wasn‚Äôt originally going to buy it but David made it sound good on Day Drinking!
Yeah I'm definitely doing a lot better now, thanks dude! Only took about 8 months. I was wondering how you are doing too. Good I hope.

My big return to reviewing was actually a Bourbon review so you probably missed it haha: https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/150tssg/review_759_thomas_h_handy_2022_6545/
And Single casks are more interesting than the middle of the road profile they aim for with the vatting in OBs
Yeah pretty much this. Caol Ila 12 is only 43% so it's even an especially weak OB bottling since a lot of scotches are bottled at 46%
Good to hear. Quite the long wait for you. So I clicked on your r/bourbon link - you were warmly welcomed back! That's cool. 

How'm I doing, well after reading your posts over there, I would concur ""I found that I could taste brighter fruity notes better and it was darker oak notes that didn't come through"" I'm still struggling to get those nice vanilla and caramel notes too. Sweet and fruity, yes but other notes are muted.

Here's a weird one. Around June 1st, 6 months after coming down with covid.I came down with deep head and chest congestion, sore throat, then completely lost my sense of taste and smell, big time. I was at a friends house, a buddy of his who just happened to work at Binnys, brought some old CS Weller. I thought, well, I'll try it, of course. I could not smell it nor taste it. It tasted like water. Is that just a bourbon thing? Tested for covid 3 times and all negative. Then came down with pneumonia. Still have the dry cough but getting better. Mezcal is clearing up the cough though and I'm sticking with sherry cask single malt so life's not too bad. All First World problems.

Haven't bought too much lately but did pick up some of the Glenturret Triple Cask, 2022. I'm not sure it deserved ""Whisky of the Year"" but it is good. Have you tried any of that?
Oh damn dude, didn't realize it had hit your senses that hard I'm sorry. I know it's particularly difficult for people like us that are passionate about our spirits. FYI I also tested myself 3 times and I never tested positive for covid either. Those at home tests aren't super reliable.

> brought some old CS Weller. I thought, well, I'll try it, of course. I could not smell it nor taste it. It tasted like water. Is that just a bourbon thing?

Yes I can totally relate to this. Bourbon was always the spirit I had the hardest time with during this whole thing. It's because they are so wood-heavy and those darker wood notes are what I had trouble with. I had the same problem with some 40+ year Armagnacs that get very dry and tannic. One Bourbon I did better with was Four Roses because it can be an especially fruity Bourbon

Yes Mezcal I could taste a lot better too haha. Clear spirits in general came through clearer, again it's the wood I had trouble with

No, I'm not really familiar with any Glenturret"

********************

**Caol Ila 2011 11yr ""Old Particular"" K&L pick, refill hogshead 55.8%**

**Nose:** Funky and spirity, new make-y buttered popcorn, cream, ash, smoke, brine, lemon, pepper

**Taste:** Sweet malt, smoke, brine, bready, lemon, lighter spirity funk, soft spice. It's sweet and citrusy, lighter on the smoke, even some bready and creamy notes in there. The spirity funk shows up but not as intrusive as the nose

**Finish:** Funky spirit, sweet malt, lemon, smoke, pastry, peppery spice

***********************

That funky spirit is just a little too strong in this stuff for my liking. Especially on the nose. Otherwise there's lots of nice familiar Caol Ila notes. It's not a super smoky one, there's sweetness and creamy malt to it. But overall I'm not a fan and I usually love Caol Ila

Score: **6/10**
Funky, huh? I love funky scotch, so I'll have to give this one a go. Thanks for reviewing it!
Seems like a standard Caol Ila release, with perhaps more kick at 55%.
thank you for doing these, I love K&L, but sometimes the picks are hit and miss
Bummer, I guess I‚Äôm glad I only split a bottle. Did you try the recent 10yr Hart Bros?
Yeah I find the same. Even when a pick seems like a real sure bet on paper I really want to try it first, or at least get someone else's thoughts on it
Curious about your thoughts when you do try it, hopefully you like it more than me. No I didn't try that one
They get good 'value' on a lot, but then you can end up with a lot of 'pretty good' bottles but not a ton of amazing ones."

**Finish:** Gritty barley, honey, still tons of sugary sweetness, some light wood and trailing spice

*********************

This might be one of the sweetest Scotches I've ever had. And it's not an overbearing sherry kind of sweetness, it's just really bright and malty. Lots of sweet malt, bright fruits, and sugary dessert type notes. Really tasty stuff and a welcome change after that terrible Glengoyne 11 PX from the previous batch. Great price on it too, easily worth it

I for one , welcome these reviews. Any chance that Macduff is in the queue?
I have the Caol Illa Old Particular, and I am excited for these reviews
I have a bottle of this too. Thanks for the review, i have a sweet tooth so will def enjoy this
The Macduff is an Old Malt Cask. I'm just trying a bunch of the Old Particulars so I won't be doing that one sorry

To sum it up: I lost my taste and smell last year due to covid, and it's been a long 8 months slowly regaining it. Been a rough time so I wanted to do something special for my triumphant return to r/Scotch. I'm a big fan of Bruichladdich, this one is from the independent bottler ""Rest & Be Thankful"" who are renowned for their bottlings of this distillery's various expressions. Purchased for about $160

Scotch review #298

**************************

**Bruichladdich 2006 16yr ""Rest and Be Thankful,"" wine hogshead #534, 60.6%**

**Nose:** Toffee, tart red berry, toasted wood, chocolate, warming spice, menthol, lactic laddie malt. Elegant, thick, tons of depth

**Taste:** Thick toffee, chocolate, tart red berries, black cherry, lactic laddie malt, gritty toasted wood, warming spice, menthol. Wine influence is prominent but it all melds together elegantly, feels amazingly well-balanced and cohesive for a single cask. It drinks more like an OB bottling.

**Finish:** The flavor flows effortlessly into the finish, dark sweet wood notes and malt intertwined with tart berry and warm spice, menthol char, it just builds bigger and thicker like a behemoth of flavor

***********************************

If you are looking for an action-packed single cask that slaps you around, this isn't it. Everything melds together elegantly and it uses every bit of that 60.6% abv to deliver tons of flavor with no real heat. It feels thick and viscous with a lot of depth, and that red berry note rises nimbly above it all to add a perfectly balanced wine-y touch that Bruichladdich does so well(how do they do wine so freaking well). That distinct Laddie flavor that many describe as ""lactic"" or ""vomity"" shines through so you know you are drinking a Laddie. Let that be a warning to anyone who doesn't like Laddie btw, this one probably won't convert you. I don't know what I was expecting from this exactly but I love it.

Score: **9/10**
What a banger of a dram to return with, sounds awesome!
Little bit of local info, the Rest and be Thankful is named after Loch Restil in the Trossachs national park. It‚Äôs about the halfway point for the drive between Glasgow and Oban as well as Glasgow and Campbeltown. It‚Äôs just a wee loch on the side of the road that lots of people stop at and go swimming either on their drive up or after hiking up some of the nearby munros.
Sounds fantastic. Not a big fan of their bottle redesign though - their other bottles are beautiful!
>many describe as ""lactic"" or ""vomity""

ugh, now I'm not sure lol
Came here to say this
It's also the name of a mountain in Jamaica, which is funny since R&B rums almost all come from Jamaica.
It's a distinct note that I love in Bruichladdich, but it puts a lot of people off for sure. It's a love it or hate it thing"

American Whiskey review #281

********************************

**Thomas H. Handy Rye 2022, 65.45%**

**Nose:** Syrupy and thick, nutty toffee, toasted oak, thick layer of spice, cinnamon, tobacco, bold grain, orange zest, mint. It simultaneously jumps out of the glass at you yet feels heavy and thick

**Taste:** Big toasted oak, syrupy cherry, zingy grain and hot herbal spice, cinnamon, mint, tobacco. A fierce spicy rye but it stays thickly balanced at the same time. Rich oak and syrupy cherry balances all the cinnamon spice heat beautifully. I love this kind of combo in a rye and this stuff does it extremely well

**Finish:** Hot rye spice, cinnamon, and cherry just keeps building and rides out for ages. Tobacco, sweet toasted oak, toffee

****************************

Such a fun Whiskey! It has the soul of a fierce hot rye but it is all contained into this thickly balanced package. Like a controlled explosion. Tons of toasted oak and syrupy cherry along with all the hot cinnamon spice. It's just so thick and syrupy for how spicy it is, I love it!

Score: **9/10**

Good to have you back, king.
Congrats on the score of the great bottle, great review but most of all cheers to your continued good health
I lost my taste and smell to covid around thanksgiving last year. It‚Äôs mostly back but I still feel like some of my sense is muted a little. Is there anything you did to test yourself or judge your progress of your senses returning? Just wondering if there‚Äôs anything you‚Äôd recommend that might help me out.
$170? That's a good price
![gif](giphy|rpsP20D23305O)

You're back! And with style
At $170/bottle I would have bought an entire case.
Absolutely my favorite of the entire 2022 BTAC line. And I have never been a huge Rye fan. This though. This is just excellent.
Bought a pour of this recently and it was fantastic, your review basically echoes everything I got from it.

Would love to find a bottle of this for retail or up to about what you paid.
Good to see you back! That‚Äôs a good pour to celebrate indeed.
Good to see you back, buddy! And totally agree with the review. I forget what year I had (it was at a bar), but what a great experience.
Great to have you back buck, excellent review
Sampled this a month ago.  It's very legit.  Unfortunately BTAC may as well not even exist for 99% of bourbon enthusiasts.
Handy is top 5.
Celebrate! I might open mine now.
Have you compared this to the ‚Äò21 THH?
Agreed. I just had it and it was 8.6 for me
I did not like the Handy at all. It was seriously complex. So much so that I was too distracted to enjoy it.
youre going to the wrong bars, my friend.
Thank you, it feels good!
Aw shucks haha
Thanks, and yes that's exactly what I'm drinking to right now. Cheers
I wish, mostly it just took time. I never stopped testing my palate though. I continued trying both new things and old familiar favorites. I narrowed down which notes specifically I was having trouble with. I found that I could taste brighter fruity notes better and it was darker oak notes that didn't come through. I had an easier time with vibrant spirits like mezcal, clear high ester rum, and fruity brandies. But I stuck with the oaky stuff that was giving me trouble, just to get regular readings of where my palate was at. I have the r/Bourbon Belle of Bedford 9yr Rye open and it has this very strong dill note that I LOVE. But I just couldn't taste it even though I knew it should be there. So I would keep going back and looking for that dill note. Some days it came through clearer than others, and then I would backtrack and it would be gone again. Two steps forward one step back kind of thing. And it just sloooowly came back over a long period of time. I would do the same with food, eating familiar things searching for the flavors that I knew should be there. But honestly I don't feel like any of it helped much. Felt like I was just waiting it out and it was coming back on it's own time. And the timeline can be different for everyone. 

I think it's a good sign that yours has mostly come back. At some point I read that most people make a full recovery within a year once it starts coming back. So I think you're on the right track and I wish you a full and speedy recovery back to 100%
Seriously‚Ä¶ if I could find that bottle for $170 I would def buy it and it would be my most expensive bottle ever but it would be worth IMO.
Wow I've never been accused of having style before!
I'm glad to hear that. I grabbed one of these at MSRP when I could have gotten the GTS, and then kind of felt like an idiot when I wasn't able to source a GTS later. But I do love the THH line.
Thanks, good to be back! Or good to be participating again anyway, I never really went anywhere haha
Yeah do it
Nope, 2022 is the only Handy I've had sorry
this has been a favorite year of THH for me so far. such a solid release
Thank you so much!"
Roger Ebert sums up Quentin Tarantino perfectly in his Pulp Fiction review back in 1994,"""Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. He's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes Pulp Fiction crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night.""

RIP Ebert. A true legend.

If you ever get the chance and you love movies, check out Ebertfest. Smaller, more intimate, more affordable, movie festival located in Eberts college town of Champaign, IL. His wife runs it now, it's a great time.
His review of *Titan A.E.* was excellent also.

>[The Ice Rings sequence is a perfect examine of what animation can do and live action cannot. The vast frozen shards of ice are clear and ominous, with a convincing presence, and the sound track does a masterful job of adding a dimension. We know sound does not travel in space, but do not care, because the groanings and creakings of the ancient ice masses are like cries of despair, and somewhere within the frozen maze lies Titan with its precious cargo.](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/titan-ae-2000)
One of the most educational and fun things I ever did was attend a multi day class/lecture about Pulp Fiction given by Ebert at UVA back in 95 or 96. It was frigging awesome.
I‚Äôm reading Quentin‚Äôs new book Cinema Speculation and in it he has a whole chapter about critics he admires for various reasons. It‚Äôs mostly centered around Kevin Thomas but he talks about how much he respected Ebert for elevating indie and subversive exploitation features (outside of his tirade against slashers.)
He‚Äôs right! There was a doc I watched recently on him where he was on set loudly addressing the entire crew. He was like 
‚ÄúAlright ! Let‚Äôs do ANOTHER take! Why? Because WE LOVE MAKING MOVIES!‚Äù 

It‚Äôs remarkable how well most of Ebert‚Äôs assessments have aged. It‚Äôs easy to critique things decades later, but it‚Äôs another thing to do it with a new release.

For contrast, check out Rolling Stone magazine‚Äôs album reviews from back in the day. They shit all over Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, etc‚Ä¶nowadays they pretend to have always known these bands were great. They give every new release 3.5 stars to avoid that problem, now. 

Edit: I found it!

Roger Ebert was a master of writing.¬†
I miss him. He was my go to. It was natural for me to check out his review of a film before watching it myself. And I'm not one who even cares about critics, I don't think I even know any right now. That guy was just special. He truly had an unadulterated love for the movies.
I miss the contemporaneously set Tarantino films.
I always knew Roger Ebert was a great film critic, but I didn't realize he was also a master of the two-thumbs-up pun
Ebert was such a ridiculously good writer. Made film criticism into an art form.
Loved his review of Watchmen, and it helped me divorce the movie from the source material and give it some appreciation.

https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/watchmen-2009
Ebert certainly had a way with words! Love the guy!
One of the best American film critics! Entertaining, informative, educational, and humble. A shame he and Gene aren't around anymore, they're legends.
Many times I‚Äôll watch a movie that got mixed reviews and end up really liking it. Afterwards I‚Äôll look up Ebert‚Äôs review and sure enough, he would be one of the few at the time that said this was a really good movie.
Every time a movie I like comes out, I get a little sad knowing that I won't be able to read a Roger Ebert review of it.
Whenever I see a movie I really enjoy, I always think about if Roger would like it. Really miss his voice
That is why he earned two pulitzer prizes for reviewing movies.
Listening to his podcast and having read his book, it's so clear there is little to no one else as passionate or knowledgeable about film as he is.
Love Ebert and miss him.
A guilty pleasure of mine is watching reviews where he and Siskel/Roeper gush about a good movie. Like their reviews of Collateral, Spirited Away or Fargo.
I can't say I always agreed with his opinions, but I loved his writing style.
Why can't critics be more like Roger ebert
Damn no reviewer can write like Ebert (but many have certainly tried).
It really is the perfect description for Quentin Tarantino. 

I watched Siskel and Ebert At The Movies when I was a kid, their reviews meant a lot. I loved it when they disagreed.
Holy shit Jerry Lee Lewis died in October? I assumed he died on some drunken rampage in the 70s.
When I saw your post I immediately knew what line you were going to quote. I read that review when it was published in my paper 29-ish years ago, and I still remember that description.
I don't like rotten tomatoes because it's not accurate to my personal movie taste. But Roger Ebert I almost always agreed with. If he liked a movie it goes on my list to watch.
Ebert could write beautifully without being verbose.
Ebert was a great writer. Some suspect taste occasionally, but always defended his opinions eloquently and passionately. He‚Äôs the person who stoked my love of movies and got me to look at movies with a critical eye.
Whilst I don't always agree with his reviews, goddamn did he have a way of putting things so sharply and eloquently. I read some of his reviews and I think ""how the hell do you come up with that?""
I seem to recall John Woo being almost the opposite once upon a time. In an article i can‚Äôt locate right now, he said something like ,‚ÄùI was flipping channels one day and started watching a movie. I thought to myself, ‚Äòhey, this is pretty good. Who made this? Oh wait, *I* made this!‚Äù
OMG WHAT YEAR IS THIS

Only kidding. I just recently wheeled this one out and was gobsmacked how pretty the picture is. Everyone looks wrapped in gold and you can almost taste the texture
""We are all born with a certain package. We are who we are. Where we were born, who we were born as, how we were raised. We are kind of stuck inside that person, and the purpose of civilization and growth is to be able to reach out and empathize a little bit with other people, find out what makes them tick, what they care about. For me, the movies are like a machine that generates empathy. If it‚Äôs a great movie, it lets you understand a little bit more about what it‚Äôs like to be a different gender, a different race, a different age, a different economic class, a different nationality, a different profession, different hopes, aspirations, dreams and fears. It helps us to identify with the people who are sharing this journey with us. And that, to me, is the most noble thing that good movies can do and it‚Äôs a reason to encourage them and to support them and to go to them.‚Äù
I was reflecting on that subject the other day with the passing of The Belz. 

Long time Stern fans would know that two of the very very best interviews on HS were: Richard Belzer and the many times that Siskel and Ebert visited. The back and forth and ragging on each other was hilarious. 

Roger was in my estimation the better reviewer of film than Roger, but the combination of the two represented the summit of cinema review. They were both highly intelligent, without the grad school sourness of someone like Janet Maslin. They were in other words, showmen!

Truly sad what happened to these two relatively young men healthwise. All we have left is some nonsense called Rotten Tomato's.

 Rotten indeed!
He was the best critic. Even though he hated The Thing, which was one of the best movies ever made.
Accurate. To extend the metaphor, I feel like with his more recent work Tarantino was basically just given the toy store to spend as long in as he wants, and the work has become overwrought and self-indulgent because of it. There are moments of his old brilliance in Once Upon a Time In Hollywood (for example), but the overall feeling was that somebody should've told little Quentin that it was time to put the toys away and go home at some point.
[deleted]
Pulp fiction and reservoir dogs are decent. Tarantino movies have such insufferable dialogue that I can‚Äôt get through them usually. He‚Äôs pretentious and awful.
Man, he was brilliant. He just got it. Criticism really died with him.
Without Roger I am adrift in the sea of cinema.
Quentin Tarrantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, in that he is a weird pervert
i hate ""review speech"" so god damned much
Again with Roger Ebert. Yes, he was a fine film critic. And yes, he was one of the few that broke into mainstream awareness (in fact, he's probably the only film critic you reading this can name).

But r/movies, I beg you--I truly, truly implore you:

Discover other film critics. For real, it's pathetic that you only know and ever talk about one film critic. Like, really, really pathetic
Back when QT was great and the dialogue rocked with quotable ear worms. Then he went up his ass pumping out shitty boring revenge flicks
Plus, the foot thing.
My least favorite QT film. Too talky and long stretches of boring
I don‚Äôt like his movies
[deleted]
His reviews were always accurate
Ebert probably LOVED hearing Jules recite the Bible verse and then cheered when he blasted the yuppies.
Let's face it... Pulp Fiction is the greatest movie of all time.
Dialect drive violence and senseless violence big fucking deal I don't think that's talent or skill it pretty sad as race of humans that most of our stories involve some sort of violence.
Ebert sucks. No he doesn't suck actually. He just has this terrible authority over so many film fans that makes me want to vomit. He's so very arbitrary in his taste and rather nitpicky in his analysis. But his worst crime was giving Sky Captain a 4 Star Review. He's not a god. He's a guy that published a lot of reviews.
If Roger Ebert was cool with child cousin marrying Jerry Lee Lewis, I‚Äôll assume he was also a creepy weirdo himself.
Awesome
I love his movies.
""If the situations are inventive and original, so is the dialogue. A lot of movies these days use flat, functional speech: The characters say only enough to advance the plot. But the people in ""Pulp Fiction"" are in love with words for their own sake. The dialogue by Tarantino and Avary is off the wall sometimes, but that's the fun.""

So true! I really like how Tarantino can make even mundane conversation gripping, eg the famous ""royale with cheese"" conversation between Samuel Jackson and Travolta.

He's definitely a case study in dialogue writing that I'll need to study up on when I write my own stuff!
I can‚Äôt imagine ChatGPT or any other AI writing anything so verbally adept and soul-connecting.
Man he spoiled the hell out of that movie though didn‚Äôt he.
Roger Ebert is the critic that every critic wishes they were
Pulp fiction is a cult classic so I don‚Äôt think Ebert was right on this, but who am I just another critic
Caste Matters by Suraj Yengede
My life feels emptier now that I realize I've never heard an ozone generator crackle.
Loved the fun and excess of Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson when I was in my 20's and 30's.  Can't say I feel the same now.
This tracks with Fiona Apple‚Äôs account of spending time with him (the flipside of him being in love with his own work):

‚ÄúApple looked back on the years of her life characterized by drug and alcohol abuse, including one wild night at the home of Quentin Tarantino. Apple was then dating filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson, whom she began seeing in 1997, and with whom she shared a tumultuous, drug-fueled three years. Apple recalled the ‚Äúone excruciating night‚Äù at Tarantino‚Äôs home that caused her to swear off cocaine forever, wherein she spent the night listening to Anderson and Tarantino brag.

‚ÄúEvery addict should just get locked in a private movie theatre with Q.T. and P.T.A. on coke, and they‚Äôll never want to do it again,‚Äù Apple joked.
I remember Kid Rock saying that one time. Something to the effect of 'why would I waste my time making something that I don't want to hear?'
That was Howard Stern
I LOVE this. I can't stand it how actors / directors don't even watch their own work.
Omg he‚Äôs Kanye
I am glad Tarantino has good taste in movies.
>I‚Äôm making what I wanna watch‚Äù

Hence the foot shots.
Artist mentality
That‚Äôs refreshing to hear
Yeah same. One of my favorite things when watching an older movie is looking up Roger's archived review afterward
My favourite thing about Ebert was that he judged a movie on its own terms.  He recognized that not every movie was trying to be Citizen Kane, some movies were just trying to entertain you for 90 minutes - he looked at how well the movie accomplished what it set out to do.

Some people never got how a throwaway crime comedy could get three and a half stars if it was well done for what it set out to do.    

""It's not what a movie is about, it's how it is about it"" is my favourite quote about movies.
His review of *Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo* was **brutal** (and well deserved). A line from it even ended up being the title of one of Ebert's books: *Your Movie Sucks*.
He was the everyman‚Äôs critic.  He had the pedigree and the knowledge and all that but deep down, he enjoyed movies purely as a window to dream for the viewer.  He understood that sometimes you don‚Äôt need movies to teach you something or to elicit something but just to entertain the fuck outta you. 

I appreciated his picks because he got past the upper crust allegories and really got down to the heart as well.  He really got the feelings you feel with a beautiful shot or a flick of the eye or the lingering touch and expressed them masterfully.  You could read a Roger Ebert review of something like *The Big Lebowski* when he says the entire supporting cast are like something out of a Raymond Chandler novel, watch the movie, and then go ‚ÄúWow he is right!  They really do belong interacting with Phillip Marlowe.‚Äù

I get why they paired him with Siskel who was the more ‚Äòstuffed shirt critic‚Äô you would expect .  Gene always seemed to be getting high off huffing his own farts while Ebert just enjoyed.

And the most wonderful thing about him?  He made you go and see a movie you wouldn‚Äôt normally see by his words.  When he espoused about *Vengence is Mine* or *Out of the Past* or *In Cold Blood*, he made you want to see the film.  I have discovered more true hidden gems through him than any other critic.

It‚Äôs that relation that shows you why Roger is long remembered today.  He was a treasure.

Edit:  ok in thinking it over, Gene Siskel had his strengths.  Maybe I am biased because I always agreed with Roger.  But he did find good in films as well.  And I would take 100 Gene Siskels over someone like Rex Reed anyway (the utter definition of a person who liked to trash flicks because he enjoyed thinking he was better than people who liked them)

Oh and I would give my front teeth to have Roger review *Everything Everywhere All at Once*  I seriously think he would have fallen in love with it.
I take great satisfaction that Roger Ebert perfectly summed up my feelings about one of my favourite movies, The Fall.

Edit: ah, I can't resist: ""*Tarsem's ""The Fall"" is a mad folly, an extravagant visual orgy, a free-fall from reality into uncharted realms. Surely it is one of the wildest indulgences a director has ever granted himself. Tarsem, for two decades a leading director of music videos and TV commercials, spent millions of his own money to finance ""The Fall,"" filmed it for four years in 28 countries and has made a movie that you might want to see for no other reason than because it exists. There will never be another like it.*""
[deleted]
There was a little slice of life pie in every review, no matter what stupid movie. He was like listening to a super articulate grandfather.
People [should check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USW1T3nN_vc) where Letterman, Siskel and Ebert go to a random neighborhood and just hang out with whoever they meet (challenging people to basketball games, doing random chores they need, etc.).
Even when I disagreed with him, I found him so fun to read.
I like Roger Ebert from the start because Siskell was always going on about the ""quality of the film"" like he was earning points in an art critic class and Ebert was focused on ""but did you enjoy watching it?""
I stopped reading reviews when he died. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, the concept of movie reviewing ended with him.
Same. I still read his reviews from time to time. His negative reviews still make me laugh.
I still love re-watching Siskel & Ebert clips, amazing show
And Bruce Willis. Already. _fuck_
If you want to miss him less, read his Saturday Night Fever review
Same but as a fan of b cinema I obviously heavily disagree with some of his opinions
Every day. Any time people ask me who my favorite writer is it's always The Rog. People expect a Novelist or something but nobody has impacted my writing more than Roger Ebert.
I miss 1994 Tarentino.
Same. I remember when I was little, watching Siskel & Ebert on SNEAK PREVIEWS on PBS. Their banter was so good.
Siskel and Ebert brought out the best in each other.  If either didn't exist, the other wouldn't have been as good.
I really need to go to Ebertfest. Plus I miss Champaign.
I remember he had this petty (but I think tongue-in-cheek) disagreement with Gene Siskel over the order of their names for *Siskel & Ebert*. 

The only thing I recall is him having this snide remark like, ""Sure. Let's put his name first. Oh, but, remind me again which one of us has a Pulitzer‚ÄΩ""
Delightful read. Ebert saw this movie later in life but his boyish excitement and wonder jumps off the page.

Compare this to say‚Ä¶ my Father, who immediately dismisses anything animated for being childish.
I just binged Arcane for the first time today. I keep thinking about Titan A.E. throughout the whole thing. Both are great.
Damn that sounds amazing I wish it was recorded. I mentioned it in another comment above, but I highly recommend the DVD commentaries he did for *Dark City* and *Citizen Kane.* He dives really deep into the movies and you learn a lot. I don't know if he did any besides those two but I would love to hear more
This sounds incredible
I'm so unbelievably jealous. That sounds amazing
Was that the shot by shot of PF and If someone wanted to touch on something they would yell stop.
Living in the past bro
Yeah exactly haha. Ebert had such clear insight into the art of film and the intentions of filmmakers. Quentin was still relatively new at this point, having only done Reservoir Dogs. And Ebert just nailed his personality through watching the films he made. 

Maybe there was more to it, I don't know if he had possibly met QT or seen interviews at this point but still he just puts it so succinctly.
Let's not act like he didn't have his blind spots. Just look at his reviews for horror movies.
I always love Sam Jackson's story on Inside the Actor's Studio of how Tarantino behind the camera acts like a kid who is just about to burst with laughter during takes.
Ebert's review of Saturday Night Fever has not aged well. Nor has the movie tbf. So much rape
Concise and insightful while never being condescending or snobbish. He really seemed to try to meet the movies where they were at and give each film the benefit of the doubt. His bad reviews are hilarious, but reading a positive review of his fills me with so much appreciation for what he got out of it, even if I disagree. 

He was such a champion of film and I miss him a lot.
Yup, he's a great of the great. 

The mark of an expert on his life is also how accessible his writing is.  Sure, you have to be a film-fan to get his many references, but he cites those references without snobbery, and always does it to reinforce his point about the key elements: character, plot, style; so plainly that anyone can appreciate what he is saying. 

Most average movie writers today just rehash the plot and base the score on what the other popular critics are giving it.
Roger ebert is the Jerry Lee Lewis of writing. He doesn't care if he tears up the piano as long as everyone is rocking. He's in love with every word- intoxicated with the idea of making a sentence. Here's a writer who's been let loose inside the toy store and wants to play all night.
A little heavy on the metaphors here though. There are like 4 of them in the span of a few sentences.
Not at screenplays tho
It might sound strange, but he's probably the celebrity death that affected me the most. Back in the day, he had a forum on Compuserve that I spent a lot of in. We talked a lot about movies, but other things too. I had a long conversation with him about Brussels sprouts. 

He was an exceptionally kind man, and he gave a lot more of his time than anyone could expect. There were lots and lots of stories from regular folks like me who hung out in the forum and who would go up and say hi if they saw him at a festival or out and about. They always ended with things like ""Roger asked me to sit down with him at his table, and we talked about the movies we had seen recently for a long time."" 

I made it into a couple of his ""Questions for the movie answer man"" articles by talking about stuff in the forum. Was a fun time.
I miss him too! I have a difficult time deciding on what movie to see ever since he passed away. I often wonder what he would have thought of today‚Äôs films. What movies he would have given 4 stars out of 4 stars.
I can't recommend an Ebert alternative. 

But Film Crit Hulk Smash does (or did, haven't caught up recently) essay-style reviews of films that I always found entertaining (though I often disagreed with at least a few opinions). They have a patreon but last I checked all of the essays were free.

Check them out, might entertain, and you're guaranteed to learn some film history along the way.
I never even thought about that before wow. His last 4 films have been historically set. Other than Deathproof, he hasn't done a contemporaneous film since Kill Bill in 2004
I wonder if he's avoiding having to deal with smartphones, they can complicate things plot-wise.
> I miss the contemporaneously set Tarantino films.

He's 59. He wrote Pulp Fiction at age 30-31, at the peak of understanding the world that he currently lived in. I wonder if Tarantino is wise enough to know that the world of today is not the world he understands anymore.

If so, that's far more wise than the vast majority of people. Most older people don't want to face that the world they grew up in doesn't exist. [I unfortunately feel this personally.]
I think if he tried to make a contemporary film, it'd be his worst one. Tarantino needs a setting he would love to live in, and I suspect he can't really make heads or tails out of today's reality.
Oh definitely this. Not even 100% contemporary but even within the last 20 years would be great. 
In my opinion his last great movie was Inglorious, the more recent ones have been good, but overly long and more concerned with creating a historical setting rather than the actual story.
Not sure if you're aware or not, but Siskel and Ebert's review show At the Movies is where the phrase ""two thumbs up"" comes from. They would each give a movie a thumbs up or thumbs down and the best movies that they both agreed on would get two thumbs up.
_‚ÄúIt's not what a movie is about, it's how it is about it.‚Äù_
I love their appearances on Stern!
I kind of know what you mean, although I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing just different from his earlier stuff. To me Inglorious Basterds was his peak. It struck an amazing balance between that frenetic Quentin energy and the more meticulous self-indulgent aspects of his later films you're talking about
Yeah his last bonafide classic was Inglorious Basterds. I think his long time editor passed away at some point and he doesn't seem to have anyone else to tell him no.
Trying to make Tarantino join reddit?
We're in the minority with this opinion. I honestly have never read a ton of Kael (whereas I read almost all of Ebert's 10,000 reviews). I just don't get Kael.
A foot fetish is pretty innocuous compared to marrying your underaged cousin
Riveting stuff
His foot fetish wasn't established yet in 1994. He had only done Reservoir Dogs so far and there aren't any woman in that film so no feet. Uma Thurman's barefoot scenes in Pulp Fiction were iconic at the time, but no one knew yet that he was actually playing on his fetish lol
not always. he has gone back and admitted he was wrong about certain movies. I think he wrote a bad review of the godfather 2 as I remembered?
I wouldn't call it an ""authority"" over my enjoyment of film. I just find his insights very interesting. He is so fluent in the language of filmmaking and such a great writer. He adds to my enjoyment of a film that I liked more than actually dictating what I do or don't like. I don't always agree with him
Agree!

For fun, asked GPT-3:

You are a film critic. Write a positive review of the movie ""Pulp Fiction"" in the style of Roger Ebert. Use big words, a lot of metaphors, and comparisons to obscure works and artists in other art forms. Go off on philosophical tangents as often as possible.

It came back with:


""Pulp Fiction"" is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the usual boundaries of conventional cinema. Quentin Tarantino has created a work of art that is part epic poem, part absurdist theatre, and wholly unique. It is a film that uses the language of cinema flawlessly, weaving together disparate elements of culture and narrative in ways that align it with some of the great works of literature like Homer's Iliad or Keats' ""Ode on a Grecian Urn.""

Tarantino crafted a story in which an array of characters, each one more vivid than the last, have to confront their most primitive selves. From Vincent Vega's calm and collected pursuit for redemption to Jules Winnfield's determined faithfulness to his code of honor, these characters are compelled by forces beyond their control. They enventually come to understand the mysterious machinations of fate while also realizing they do not have complete mastery over their own destinies.

The cinematography also stands as a testament to Tarantino's skill as an artist. From the wide angle shots to panning in on particular moments, every scene has been carefully crafted with aesthetics in mind and it displays his immense technical prowess. The soundtrack features some classic hits mixed with lesser known numbers from various musical genres, creating an eclectic ambience that underscores the action happening on screen.

Pulp Fiction is an enthralling exploration into how our decisions can define us and how fear can make us delay taking action even when we know we must act quickly. It is a movie that speaks to our innermost fears about life and death with humor and wit. As much as it shows us what it means be human, ""Pulp Fiction"" also reminds us that life sometimes requires us to do things we would rather not do but must do nonetheless - be it signing off on contracts or facing our own dark secrets - in order for us to truly live up again.
Tfw I will never be locked in a private movie theatre doing coke with Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson talking about their movies
Everyone commenting that they'd have enjoyed this experience has never been around a narcissist on cocaine before.

Imagine two dogs barking at each other through a fence for hours, but and one of them looks like this:

Wager any film student would kill to be Fiona Apple on that night
I mean, I don't know, I feel like this says more about Fiona Apple not really being a film dork.

Put me in a room with Tarantino, PTA and a pile of cocaine, and I'm gonna be having one of the best nights of my damn life.
So directors aren't supposed to love their own movies? If that were the case all we'd have are hacks. Did you know the guy who directed First Blood also directed Weekend At Bernies? Do you think he loved his own movies? I don't think so. Those guys look at their films like they are their own children. They give a shit, and watching them will only help make their future films better. 

As far as cocaine goes I'm sorry, but in the '70s there were these directors named Scorsese, Coppola, De Palma, etc. who did tons of coke and made great movies. I'm sure they sat around for weeks high as kites jabbering to each other about their flicks. 

Fiona acts as if musicians haven't done the exact same thing x1000000 since cocaine was discovered. For fuck's sake, she has the most coke-fueled album title EVER: 

When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks Like a King What He Knows Throws the Blows When He Goes to the Fight and He'll Win the Whole Thing 'Fore He Enters the Ring There's No Body to Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might So When You Go Solo, You Hold Your Own Hand and Remember That Depth Is the Greatest of Heights and If You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know Where to Land and If You Fall It Won't Matter, Cuz You'll Know That You're Right. Or for short: WTPHTCHTLAKWHKTTBWHGTTFAHWTWTFHETRTNBTBWYMIYMSWYGSYHYOHARTDITGOHAIYKWYSTYKWTLAIYFIWMCYKTYR.

That's the NAME of the album. That she dedicated to PTA inside. Pot kettle black, Fiones.
Getting a bit off-topic I know, but I think is like the only 'shady' or negative thing I've read about PTA (my favourite director on most days). Maybe I've just not read widely enough. He's always seemed like a jarringly regular guy & I'd expect him to be a bit more eccentric considering the movies he makes
It‚Äôs kinda ironic because it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs describing the coke fueled tense scene in Boogie Nights of the dealer talking about music with firecrackers going off.
TIL Kid Rock has horrible music taste
$$$
Didn't he also say that the rap rock he made was ""kind of gay""
This comment is odd not everybody likes to watch or listen themselves when filmed
Always has been
Without the nazism and perpetual yeezy in the mouth.
If you have Letterboxd there‚Äôs accounts that post Roger Ebert reviews too!
I do this all the time. We miss you Roger
I worked at a locally owned video store years ago. His reviews were unofficially required reading for my coworkers and me.
The best thing about Ebert is he genuinely loved movies and never turned his nose up to anything.
Same. I used to buy his year end in reviews book and read all his reviews.
Same.  Especially if the dog bites.
Oh, you should definitely watch the movie North, then.
Whoa, cool idea. I'm going to start doing this.
I do this often. It makes me feel like he‚Äôs still with us.
What about Ace Ventura, he panned it.
His review of Aliens is about my favorite ever. Look it up
Back in the day a two thumbs up from Siskel & Ebert was a guaranteed good pic.
>‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not what a movie is about, it‚Äôs how it is about it‚Äù is my favourite quote about movies.

Oh man that is such a perfect reply to the old and infuriating ‚Äúa movie that‚Äôs bad is okay because I just want a popcorn movie‚Äù argument.

Making a great, pure, brain-soothing popcorn movie is hard and takes talent.
I like how Ebert didn't care that Hackers wasn't realistic to actual hacking. He enjoyed the movie, and commented that Indiana Jones isn't real archaeology. Ebert gave fair reviews to movies that did what they were trying to do, for the audience they were trying to reach.
It shows the flaw in the rating system (in general).

John Wick is a 5/5 action film but not anywhere close to a 5/5 film. But with only one metric it becomes really hard to differentiate that.
To be fair, we're talking about a man who wrote a Russ Meyer movie.

Anything less than ""judging a movie on its own terms"" and Ebert would have been a hypocrite.
Rob Schneider blew a fucking gasket over that one, to the point where he was calling talk shows during Ebert appearances just to heckle him. 

Later on, during Ebert's illness, he [wrote](https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/a-bouquet-arrives) about receiving a beautiful arrangement of flowers from *Your least favorite movie star, Rob Schneider*. He was genuinely touched by the gesture and said he hoped that he would love a movie of Schneider's in the future. 

Sadly, that never happened, and Schneider went back to being a dickhole.
Deuce Bigelow represents a generational break IMHO.  Among other great moments, it has one of the best slow reveal jokes.  Deuce gets dressed up to meet his dad at a fancy restaurant, >!but only gradually you learn his dad isn't a diner, but the bathroom attendant.!<
I had never heard of this movie until reading your comment, and from its title only, it's pretty obvious that it's a terrible movie.
While I do agree with what you say about Ebert, I don't know if I'd characterize Siskel that way. 

Gene felt cut from the same cloth such as looking for something that entertained you, like when he came to defense of Mortal Kombat in their review. 

It seemed they'd play up the differences just for the entertainment value of their show, but I feel Ebert and Siskel were more alike than that.
I highly recommend Ebert's DVD commentaries. I only know of two, *Dark City* and *Citizen Kane.* They are like sitting through a film class lecture. Very interesting and fun
I love his review of a 80‚Äôs movie called Class of 1984. Most critics trashed but he liked it a lot.


‚ÄúClass of 1984"" has received some really savage criticism. Newsweek called it ""The Class of 1982 with herpes."" What does that mean? I dunno. I guess it means the critic found the movie so hateful that it wasn't worth anything more than cheap wisecracks.

But unless we can accept talent wherever we find it in the movies, and especially in smaller genre movies without big stars, we're going to be left with nothing but overpriced lead balloons and delicate little exercises in sensibility. ""Class of 1984"" is raw, offensive, vulgar, and violent, but it contains the sparks of talent and wit, and it is acted and directed by people who cared to make it special.‚Äù
I also loved how he was willing to change his mind about a film sometimes years after first seeing (almost always turning out to like a film he once misunderstood). That kind of intellectual honesty is a rare thing to show to the public, especially when you're as famous as he was. I'm having trouble remembering a specific example, but there was a movie called The Brown Bunny that he hated and got into it with the filmmaker Vincent Gallo. Gallo eventually cooled down, re-edited it, showed it to Ebert again who ended up liking the new cut. It really shows that he went into practically every movie willing to give it a chance no matter how bad it was.
I even enjoyed the argument for games. I don‚Äôt agree but I thought it was interesting to have debate
I always preferred Siskel as a young person, because he was more consistent. Roger always seemed more likely to play to the mainstream crowd because he wanted to be liked. If a popular movie was drek, Gene wouldn‚Äôt let it off the hook because it was intended to be for mainstream audiences. He was also more jaded because he saw so many movies and that would sometimes influence his reviews. 

As I grew older, I came to appreciate Ebert more. He was less jaded and was able to appreciate movies based on what they were trying to achieve, rather than viewing everything through an ‚ÄòAcademy Award potential‚Äô prism.


My favorite example of this is Ebert‚Äôs ‚ÄòHome Alone 3‚Äô review. It would‚Äôve been real easy to write it off as a cheap cash-in with inferior actors, say some snarky lines and ship it, but he recognized it as a respectable installment in a family-friendly comedy. Gave it a thumbs up based on that.
U should watch ‚Äúbeyond the valley of the dolls,‚Äù which he wrote the screenplay for. Quite a fun watch.
I will forever be sad that he passed before Fury Road came out.  I believe his review would have been something to print and frame on my office wall.
Which is the most important thing to keep in mind when reviewing movies. Are you reviewing the critical aspects of the movie or how much you enjoyed it? The fast and furious movies are not great, but they're fun movies to turn your brain off and watch.
He reviewed Freddy got Fingered lol
[deleted]
I watched this a few years ago with no foreknowledge of it.  I loved it.  I thought it was beautiful, well acted, strange and at times confusing.  I don't recall it perfectly now, but I remember loving Lee Pace and the little girl, and feeling very moved by it. I saw that some people didn't love it, and that's fine, but I think you can argue it's one of the most visually striking films there is.
i‚Äôd say ebert knows a thing or two about b cinema. after all he wrote the script for beyond the valley of the dolls
I think you and me might be the only two people that miss Champoo-Banana.
This is what I admired and loved about Ebert. He never lost his love of pulp sci-fi and adventure. He was a champion for earnest pulp shlock to the very end.
My brothers and I managed to put Spirited Away on while we were having lunch. After a fair bit of protest we finally got my mother and father to watch it after they agreed to ""15 minutes and if you don't like it we'll turn it off"". My dad sat and watched the whole thing even though it was my mom who wanted to watch it more.
It would have been long. It was three three hour sessions, if I recall correctly.

They used a video projector and Hong Kong grey area import laserdisc because it hadn't been released on video yet. In fact, it had been rereleased after the Oscars and was playing at the Cinema Four behind the Kmart on 29n at the time.
Definitely watching the Dark City one. Such a fun movie to dive into.
I recently listened to his Casablanca commentary track and loved it, would definitely recommend.
It was audience interactive as well. He encouraged people to give their impressions and interpretations.

In the Gold Watch segment a guy in the audience brought up all the Vietnam allusions, with Walken, the action movie that wakes Butch up, and Vietnamese Pot Bellied pigs in reference to Fabienne wanting a sexy pot belly and how that implies the relationship Butch has with her is both a stand in, eroticization of the relationship he never had with his dad, and one where he could be a father because Fabienne is innocent childlike.

Ebert politely disagreed.
I believe so.
My personal favorite is his review of Blue Velvet, which he completely trashes. He also assumes Isabella Rosallini had a horrible time making the movie, which couldn't be further from the truth ha ha. He was a remarkable reviewer, but occasionally had very strange takes.
I think you have to give Roger this one, though: 

[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-devils-rejects-2005](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-devils-rejects-2005)

Not at all what you'd expect his review of this movie to be.  Also, one of my favorite reviews from him.
Or his review of Starship Troopers where he thinks the satire was largely an accident, as opposed to openly mocking both the source material and the ideology. He even likens his reaction to the film as similar to his reaction to the book.

Still love the guy and his reviews, but he wasn't 100% like people are acting.
That super famous shot of him dancing behind the camera as he directs John Travolta and Uma Thurman dancing in Pulp Fiction.

I saw a cool interview with him about Resevoir Dogs. He said the first day of filming he showed up in the morning and saw all the film trucks parked down the street, and it just hit him: he was directing a movie! His WILDEST dreams had come true! He used to just work in a video store..
When he loved a film he would champion it. Dark City being one of them.
A writer is quoted on Ebert's obituary page of Ebert's website and it's one of my favorite quotes about the man:

A writer I know once told me he didn‚Äôt read Ebert because he could get a plot summary anywhere. It‚Äôs true that a typical Ebert review contains mostly plot synopsis, but it‚Äôs mostly plot synopsis the way diamonds are mostly coal.‚Äù

‚Äî Wesley Morris, Grantland
Iginlas\_4head\_Crease is the Jerry Lee Lewis of turning Roger Ebert quotes into copypasta. He doesn't care if he tears up the piano as long as everyone is rocking. He's in love with every right click- intoxicated with the idea of making a meme. Here's a redditor who's been let loose inside the toy store and wants to play all night.
If he had done one more it would have been metaphives.
I think he was purposely doing that to match the ""pulp fiction"" writing style. He unleashed several metaphors right after talking about the anything-goes style of the old pulp digests.
I broke down sobbing when he died. I had felt connected, not just by a relatively similar taste in movies or because his early work shaped me so much as a movie goer. What really cemented the bond was the sheer number of times he responded directly to me in his blog. One time, towards the very end, he responded to me at what would have been 3am in Chicago and I fired back, ""What the hell are you doing awake this late."" When I saw how debilitated by chronic pain he was at that time during the doc about him I cried so hard. Rest in peace Rog. I miss you, pal.
Same. I can't tell you how many times I'll watch a film and think (what would Ebert think of this?).
Kill Bill felt so divorced from reality that it had no temporal anchor
It's surprisingly more common than you'd think. Spielberg hasn't done a contemporaneous film since War of the Worlds in 2005. Scorsese hasn't done one since The Departed in 2006. The Coen Brothers haven't done one since Burn After Reading in 2008 (Ethan's upcoming solo film may be though).

I think it's a mix of all these things people are mentioning. Lack of being hip and on top of the current zeitgeist like they once were, but they are also at a time when they don't have to make movies out of what resources they have available to them and have the clout to spend a bit of money completely creating, or recreating, a world.
He should do a sci-fi movie next set in the future
I think he really liked Death Proof and when the audiences overwhelmingly rejected it, it broke his heart a little.

Personally I will always watch Death Proof when asked. It‚Äôs a whacky, uncompromising experiment that is beautifully obsessed with details.
He's just enamored with the settings in the films he had available to him as a youth.
Or his vision has expanded as he's gotten more successful, so he can think in terms of creating epic period pieces, which he wouldn't have been able to do as a young filmmaker.
> I wonder if Tarantino is wise enough to know that the world of today is not the world he understands anymore.

This is *exactly* why we have no current-period films of his. His understanding peaked in a world before smart phones and he's consciously aware and trying to avoid becoming the ""how do you do, fellow kids?"" meme
I think the real reason is that his films are pastiches of the cinema he watched in his formative years.
It is also likely that once a director gets the type of juice where they can pick and choose their movies they pick the passion projects which are largely based on history, things they were obsessed with as kids, or high dollar spectacles. Conversely, the creative contemporary movies are personal projects that are lower dollar and stand out which is why they are done early in the career.
What's your definition of contemporary? Both Jackie Brown and Kill Bill are both set in the time period they were shot in.
IMO the real issue is the loss of his lifelong editor, the brilliant Sally Menke. 

Since her passing, his movies have gotten longer, sloppier and more self indulgent. Not bad, just missing someone equal to his own talent willing to reign in Tarantino's ever ambitious vision to its purest and highest form.

Inglorious Basterds is the last of his films she worked on, and is an absolute masterclass in editing. Not a single wasted scene, not one missing moment.
That was the mark of a good movie. Much like Rotten Tomatoes is today.
Feels like there should've been four thumbs involved.
>his last bonafide classic was Inglorious Basterds. I think his long time editor passed away at some point

Sally Menke passed away in 2010 and the last Tarantino Movie she edited was Inglorious Basterds so you are correct
Same way I feel about this thread
There's also the cab driver's bare foot in PF
The only one he regretted pretty much immediately was Unforgiven. He admitted quickly he was in a bad mood when he gave it 2.5/4, had it in his top 10 of 1992 by the end of the year and later re-wrote his review for a Great Movie essay.
Blade Runner as well. I believe he originally gave Blade Runner 3 out of 4 stars then after Ridley Scott did his re-edits, Ebert updated his review and gave it a 4 out of 4!
[deleted]
Yeah totally. They‚Äôd probably like being lectured by him without being allowed a word in edgewise‚Äîand Tarantino assuming their interest in everything he has to say would likely be correct‚Ä¶ but when Tarantino apparently has no read on Apple‚Äôs face/interest or no sustained curiosity in her‚Äîa contemporary in the arts‚ÄîYIKES. This dynamic can be especially exhausting as a woman‚Äî as we too often experience men talking at length/explaining to us without gauging interest or our own knowledge/experience.

She was dating PTA. She'd probably heard all his BS 20 times over, then watched it skyrocket to 11 under the influence of cocaine and someone to one-up.
You are hugely straw manning what she said lol.
Was that not already obvious?
Yea but at least he isn‚Äôt the epitome of white trash‚Ä¶ohhhhhh nevermind
This guy don't even bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy.
But he's a bull frog, you understand?
Your comment is odd, because I'm not denying that. I just don't like it.
You can also find a bunch of At The Movies episodes on Youtube
What's the advantage of this over reading them from his website directly?
You can ask ChatGPT to write you movie reviews like they were written by roger Ebert.


I'll be in this nuclear bunker over here if you need me...
Can you recommend a good one to follow?
What are they?
He hated ""Full Metal Jacket"".
It was so refreshing having him judge movies based on ""did they do what the set out to do"" rather than the Siskell (and every pretentious critic out there) perspective of ""was it high art?""
He turned his nose up at a lot of movies.
I suspect Rob Schneider was and always remained a dickhole, but his wife or agent or someone with an ounce of decency told him to send flowers.
> Sadly, that never happened, and Schneider went back to being a dickhole.

his daughter's kind of cool, his current wife seems nice
That‚Äôs Rob [‚Äúskyrocketing Raising Cane‚Äôs employee‚Äù](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fHfPuaG7M) Schneider to you!
That's the first one. His review was about the sequel. I had forgotten how great that reveal was though. I watched that movie way more times than I'd like to admit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRN7nh7-eZI
You should really look up that review. It says it so much better that I ever could.
Generally, I think Siskel was just wary of trends in Hollywood. He wanted a focus on the craft and acting and was hesitant about movies shifting toward special effects productions that lost the human element. But yes he definitely liked some films that a true snob wouldn‚Äôt.
Yeah they were both Chicago(-area) guys with no time for bullshit. Miss them both. They introduced young me to taking film seriously.
Dark City is an amazing movie that not nearly enough people have seen
Casablanca too
he did one for Criterion for Ozu's ""Floating Weeds""...that's a double-bill dvd set with Doanld Ritchie doing commentary for the original b&w silent picture.

both are excellent - movies & commentaries...
It‚Äôs interesting seeing the progression of his thoughts on Blade Runner across the years and different cuts build from not being huge on it, to by the end putting it in his ‚Äúgreat movies‚Äù lineup.
Brown Bunny was shit though even after the re-edit.
At the time I remember hating his description of Myst as being like being like ‚Äúwatching Hamlet but you have to stop after every scene to play tic-tac-toe‚Äù.

As I get older though I find myself thinking about that analogy a lot. Especially with games where it feels like the mechanics are just a means to convey a movie/tv show broken up into awkwardly paced segments.
I think he would have changed his mind after watching The Last of Us.
I think his argument is total nonsense, and I don't think I could even debate it. He basically said that it's not art if it gives you choice. He doesn't really explain *why* that matters, and I honestly cannot imagine why it would matter.
>able to appreciate movies based on what they were trying to achieve, rather than viewing everything through an ‚ÄòAcademy Award potential‚Äô prism.

I made the same comment above somewhere and its 100% what I liked about him.

""It's not what a movie is about, it's how it is about it.""
I tend to agree with Siskel's opinions a lot less. I mean the man thumbed down Taxi Driver, The Terminator, Silence of the Lambs and Apocalypse Now.

Ebert may have had a lot of opinions I scratch my head at, but that's just taking the biscuit.

Still like them both though, is very fun picking which side you agreed with on many different debates when re-watching episodes of their show.
No question he would have given that movie 4 out of 4 stars ! I myself wonder what he would have thought of Man of Steel.
Every time I think of him I hear him saying something like ""it had great stunts and action.""  I'm pretty sure I remember him using that line in one of their TV shows. Yes, he would have loved it.
Especially now that it isn‚Äôt available anywhere.
Hahaha very true, that‚Äôs why I think he‚Äôs kind of a hypocrite
Perhaps so! Regardless,it'll always hold a special place in my heart. 

Also Champoo-Banana üòä love it
Wow‚Ä¶ lot of layers to that. Wow‚Ä¶

That‚Äôs a better question for QT than Ebert. Not everything has a meaning
I loved Blue Velvet but I get why he didn‚Äôt like it. He loved Muholland Drive.
He was also unable to look past his personal feelings about Catholicism.
That was a great review because the whole Groucho Marks stuff went over my head.
That was great. His opinions are so nuanced. He never just says something is good or it sucks. Just as OP said, he really does seem to understand filmmaker‚Äôs intentions.
He‚Äôs definitely not perfect, but his average is pretty dang good when you consider he published around 10,000 reviews.  I guess his tastes just tended to line up with my own. Somebody else mentioned his opinions on horror movies, or Marvel movies‚Ä¶.but I can‚Äôt stand those either! 

It was always great when him and Siskel disagreed on a film. Because they could both argue their side well. 

I will say that Roger Ebert made an awful tweet about Ryan Dunn immediately after he passed away. However, he was mature enough to admit that he‚Äôd made a mistake afterwards.
His commentary track for *Dark City* is a classic.
For real haha. I think I feel similarly about Deathproof although I haven't actually watched that in a long time
I‚Äôm seen to recall some theory or wild claim that all Tarantino movies are in the same ‚Äúuniverse,‚Äù but that Kill Bill was a fictional movie in the Tarantinoverse. Which would explain how it is so over-the-top and divorced from reality.
I feel like the only reason my adolescent friend group liked Kill Bill so much was because we were in the exact age range to be weeb-ish enough to get caught up in it.

As an adult I've never really gotten a strong urge to re-watch those films, whereas I've watched Pulp Fiction numerous times.
Depends on your particular reality tbh. I‚Äôm surrounded by killers constantly
I like the fan theory that all QT movies take place in an alternate universe, where hyper violence is the norm.

Usually people point at the violent end of the Nazis as shown in Inglorious as the primary divergent point, though Django might have had more of an alternate historical significance.
Also, it is freaking hard to write compelling stories in a world with cellphones when you grew up without them.
PTA also. Not since Punch Drunk Love.
It's funny even the TV show Fargo, based on the Coen Brothers work has yet to have a hasn't done a contemporaneous season. That's one thing I like about it though. World changed after the iPhone I think.
*Star Trek IV: Uhura Unchained*
He has mentioned wanting to do a Star Trek movie in the past. Tarantino Star Trek would be pretty fuckin great.
I wonder if his upcoming show is set in modern time.  I don't think he'd be actually make a film set in the future.
Something on the edges of the Federation - starting out at DS9 station and following people & ships that operate in the fuzzy borders  between the empires & federations. Probably involving Orions and tramp freighters with a touch of Ronin.
I remember seeing the double feature at the drive in when it came out and it was the perfect way to consume those movies. I had gone to that drive in a few times growing up but nothing compared to Grindhouse.
One of the problems with ""Death Proof"" is that it was tacked on to the whole ""Grindhouse"" movie and that was a really long double-movie (really one movie with two features in it, and some goofy trailers and stuff). Wasn't it 3+ hours or so? I think its length was daunting for audiences.   


I recall they re-released ""Death Proof"" on its own, in a more limited way, but I don't think there was much advance marketing or anything. I also don't think it's a very good stand-alone Tarantino movie. It's so purposely retro, and it purposely has a ""missing reel"" in the middle to replicate an old low-budget cinema experience, that it doesn't work well as its own theatrical feature.
Or maybe he just doesn't find current times worthy.
If you saw an added ‚Äú‚Ä¶way up!!‚Äù it was probably going to be epic
Eh, as someone who works in the entertainment business... listening to anyone's ego bragging about their accomplishments, no matter how prolific, gets old.
Anyone interested in hearing QT gush about films and filmmaking should check out the podcast he does with Pulp Fiction co-writer Roger Avary.  The setup is pretty amazing‚Ä¶ QT bought the entire stock of the video rental store they both worked at as young men and had it moved to his home, lock stock and barrel.  They watch a triple feature on VHS from the shelves of the store as the basis for most episodes. Roger‚Äôs daughter Gala provides a younger person‚Äôs perspective in the recap, plus researches ways for the public to be able to see the films.
My name is kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid
That‚Äôs a weird thing to dislike
I would subscribe to any streaming service that would be put up even just a small portion of these in half decent quality
Convenience, if you're already a letterboxd user.
It‚Äôs just nice to log a film and then see his review right there under the film
Are they mixing in ""new"" reviews under the same moniker?
https://boxd.it/1jGt3
So what? It's just a movie like any other, and people have their own tastes.

Just because some movie is considered a classic doesn't mean that everyone has to like it, and it is especially doesn't mean that everyone had to have liked it when it was released.
And The Thing.
Hell he gave Lord of the Rings movies a 3 and 3 and 3.5. I love him but oh my god can he be wrong. He gave Camerons Avatar a fucking 4. A 4, ranking it as a great movie. Ranking it better than a trilogy of the greatest fantasy movies ever (and i personally feel, will ever be) made.
I think he hated Step Brothers as well.
He didn't hate it. He thought the first part was great and the second part not so much (I disagree). He didn't think it was up there with Strangelove or 2001 (I agree).
Critic's are just like us. Their approval of a movie is based on opinion. They're just able to express their opinion in a way that attracts views, while also dedicating their time to become knowledgeable about movies. But at the end of the day, it is only \*their\* opinion. It might not align with your view, it might not align with the majority of views. So don't be surprised if he has a few questionable reviews.
He did not like some movies of course. But It was never because he turned his nose up to them. It was always on the movie's own terms. I'm sure someone might find one or two exceptions because he was a human being. But they would only be minor exceptions.
I saw his daughter supporting Modest Mouse years back and my buddy asked me who it was and I just said ""it's Rob Schneider's daughter"" and carried on enjoying the show. He thought I was drunk and just gave a random answer until afterwards when I had to convince him otherwise.
I liked the first one. It was dumb, but had some funny stuff in it.
I never bothered with the sequel.
I went and saw Dark City in the theater by myself because of Ebert and a lack of friends wanting to see it.

An amazing movie!
I think of it every time I shut down my computer. ""Shut it dowwwwn!!!""
Oh that's awesome thanks! I've actually never seen Casablanca so I think its time. I'll get the disc just so I can get his commentary too
Never saw it, but I kind of figured . . .
Why are people downvoting this man? Lol
Agreed. I didn‚Äôt even like the controversial scene.
Imagine you took his favorite movie, and you made it so that unfortunately, you can only ever watch it 5 minutes on 5 minutes off, or something like that. It would be very annoying, and make the movie much worse, but would he then say it's no longer art?
Trying to convince someone of games-as-art by showing them a game that does *what movies do* is not a good idea. Something like *Journey* would be, to a person like Ebert, completely approachable but also totally different.
Dude stubborn but knows

he defined it for himself very specificly
Ya, Siskel had a problem with movies that seemed exploitive unless they had some payoff that was redemptive or uplifting. Just wallowing in human  misery or violence wasn‚Äôt his bag.

Even though he he disliked Taxi Driver, he still had it in his top ten for the year. Which is a choice.
>I tend to agree with Siskel's opinions a lot less. I mean the man thumbed down Taxi Driver, The Terminator, Silence of the Lambs and Apocalypse Now.

That should be a career ender for a film critic.
He usually tended to hate/be disappointed in movies that devolved into mindless action scenes. He also hated Superman Returns for its ""depressing"" depiction of Superman

So I suspect he might not have liked it.
He‚Äôd definitely get a kick out of that analysis though.
Yeah, that movie is not everyone's cup of tea for sure, it's always his condemnation of Lynch for his use of Rossellini that I find hilarious. I'm sure he didn't feel that way his whole life though. Reviewing is reacting and he was amazing at that.
On Cinema is pretty good at showing both sides as well in a similar vein. It's all about the movies.
Deathproof feels like its 2006 but also the 70s never ended.
I think QT said that himself lol
The vipers were Fox Force Five.
Great example!
They did a season based on 2013, which was pretty much as modern as it gets without the Minnesotans taking a break from their small town crime mysteries to make Tiktoks
Oh, my-y-y-y-y!
The sheer amount of alien feet this would have
*Pulp Sci-Fi* set in the far off future of 2022, retro stylized to appear to have been made in the 1993.
That‚Äôs what is coming. He already wrote and is going to direct at least one season of a Star Trek show
Tarantino's said before if he did his original science fiction idea, it'd be modern day. Even his Trek project was going to be based on a TOS episode where Kirk and Spock go to a planet inspired by 1930s gangsters. It was basically Tarantino scratching his also stated itch to do a pinstripes and tommy guns gangster movie while also making a Star Trek film.
That sounds fantastic.
I have a sinking feeling that most of the masters have likely been lost. And what we see now on YouTube are people‚Äôs home VHS recordings of broadcasts. I hope I‚Äôm wrong, but if that‚Äôs the case that‚Äôs the best quality we‚Äôll ever have.
Some of them on YouTube, whoever posted them has the video zoomed back into a small screen for the whole episode. I want to scream at them.
There used to be an official website where you could watch their reviews, I'm pretty sure Disney owned at least some of their shows
> and never turned his nose up to anything.
He ripped The Raid apart as being a gamer's idea of a fun movie.

Then again, he absolutely loved Cloud Atlas as the ineffable emotional ride it is, so he basically covers the whole gamut of opinions as far as I am concerned. Pretty entertaining still, and his view of Cloud Atlas, seeing as I really love it a whole lot, garnered him a bunch of points.
He also hated Joe Dirt.
damn that lotr review pisses me off
Lord of the Rings is not for everyone. I think fans of it assume that everybody agrees that it's an incredible, epic film series. I personally saw them all at the movies because I was dragged along by friends that love the books. I fell asleep in all three at certain points, and genuinely have no desire to watch them, and I pretty much exclusively read fantasy and sci-fi.

LOTR maybe has the biggest echo chamber of fans of all time.
Good call. I rented it because I rented everything in those days. It was rough. A woman had a penis on her face.
I sort of feel like the trailer really didn't do the film justice. If you watched the trailer I'd almost understand that it looks sort of like a boring ""dark physically not thematically"" scifi film. I do envy you seeing it in a theatre. I wish it had enough of a cult following to do midnight screenings somewhere. I think the film still holds up well even today.
Casablanca is magnificent on its own as well, it's an old favorite.
‚Ä¶ no? He would just say the person playing the movie doesn‚Äôt know how to work a projector.

The analogy doesn‚Äôt really work because the movie becomes annoying due to being played in a way the creator didn‚Äôt intend and with interruptions that actively harm the viewing experience. In the ‚ÄúHamet-tac-toe‚Äù analogy you are playing the game exactly as the creator intended, but the mechanics don‚Äôt add anything to the narrative. This isn‚Äôt a critique of all games, just a certain kind of game where it feels like the creator had a movie playing out in their head and just used gameplay to break it up rather than as an active component in storytelling.
Ebert once shared that the maker's of Journey went to his house and set up the game for him for free. He still concluded it ain't art, pissing off a lot of people. But I have no doubt he would eventually come around with something like The Last of Us, RDR2, or Horizon Zero Dawn. Ebert was open minded and willing to admit when he was wrong.
Journey is great but it‚Äôs a bit too artsy to make the case for video games as art, if that makes sense. It‚Äôs clearly trying super hard to be artistic, so the fact that it‚Äôs a work of art doesn‚Äôt sell the genre, just this one game. 

God of War is a better example than Last of Us. The beauty of that game is mostly from the minor interactions that are unique to video games than from the overall narrative. Last of Us is a great story told in game form but we‚Äôre seeing now that it‚Äôs just as great as a show.
>. Just wallowing in human misery or violence wasn‚Äôt his bag.

That's my jam.
When was the last time it was all about the movies? That maniac Tim can't gonna season without his pointless music or some other scam. Gregg needs to spinoff, he has that Antman money now anyway
Aha that‚Äôs actually quite an accurate way to put it.
I think it was 2010 wasn't it? >!and the finale goes to 2016, which still wasn't contemporary at the time as Season 3 came out in 2017!<. Season5 I believe is rumored to be set in 2019 tho lmao, they just hate current year I guess.
Sorry, I changed it to Uhura from Sulu for the alliteration, unfortunately after your comment.
That was just one of many film ideas he mentions in podcasts and interviews but will never make them his 10th film.
I‚Äôm a big fan.  Avary is also a director, so I‚Äôve learned so much about how scenes are composed and crafted. Plus QTs combo of encyclopediac knowledge of film history AND personal anecdotes provide all kinds of deeper perspective.
In the 2000's, pretty much every video was archived on Ebert's website.  Since his passing, the website has turned to shit.  But the recordings are available...at least up to 20 years ago.
You're tripping hard. Definitely gettable.
They might've done that to avoid getting the video automatically taken down for copyright issues.
The point of that phrase is that Ebert wasn't a snob. If a movie was just trying to be fun entertainment, Ebert reviewed it with that in mind rather than just (for example) disliking it because it isn't trying to say something important. He disliked bad movies because they failed to live up to themselves, not because he viewed certain kinds of movies as inferior to Film.
I guess i didn't read ""never turned his nose"" as ""liked every movie he watched"". Or what, did he say that movies about war are below his fine tastes?
And Avatar is not that good of a movie period. 

LotR suffers for the genre of fantasy which i can understand people not liking. But thats its root issue. It has nothing to do with the quality if the product. Just because you might not like a steak at a world class restaurant doesn't mean its horrible. Its your own tastes. Nothing wrong with that.

But having a greasy Big Mac rank higher than it is stupid.

While i am biased towards that grade LotR received because i was raised on Tolkiens (and a massive collection if Sci-fi and fantasy) works, what is really grinding my gears is the fact he put Avatar above it. That movie (as a sci-fi fan) was laughable and painfully generic. The only thing noteworthy was the special effects and even then its just... ehh. It spectacle for spectacles sake. It doesn't deserve 4 stars and to stand with movies like Casablanca, 2001: A Space Odyssey or Citizen Kane. 

Im happy with LotR's score. Avatar though, doesn't deserve its score and thats why I'm annoyed. No echo chamber. They are well made and good movies, regardless of you liking the genre.
I luckily never had to spend money on it. Back in the good ol' days of satellite TV and a cracked decoder card giving me unlimited PPV for free.
It's the same thing. The 5 minutes of dead air and the 5 minutes of gameplay both break up the narrative and add nothing. In both cases, that could be bad for the experience, but why that means it is not art is completely indefensible.
Even God of War, which I like quite a lot would embody the tic tac toe critique. Most of the minor interactions occur when going from place to place. It breaks up the downtime and is what makes the switch to semi open world gameplay work, but most of the meaningful dialogue happens when you're not really playing.

It's a cliche pick but Dark Souls is what convinced me. I care little about the plot and even the lore doesn't interest me much but the experience of playing the game is analogous to what the player character is doing. The artistic vision is conveyed through playing the game

But games have always been art, and that's clear to anyone who has played them enough
[deleted]
True, but unlike a lot of those, there is an actual script in the Paramount vaults for that, written by the same guy who wrote the Revenant, from Tarantino's story. I still don't think it will happen, but it was more real than his Killer Crow or Kill Bill Vol. 3 ramblings.
Case in point: he gave [Anaconda](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/anaconda-1997) starring Jlo and Ice Cube 3.5/4.
Good is subjective. A good movie doesn't bore me for three hours, which the LoTR movies did. So, for me personally, they aren't as 'good' as the fans suggest.

Avatar was trash, but LoTR isn't this universally agreed upon perfect movie. Like I said, I absolutely love fantasy, but watching 9+ hours of grey just doesn't really do it for me.

I'm not saying fans are wrong to love and adore it, my point was that it's an echo chamber in the sense that fans usually can't wrap their head around people not liking it or praising it the way they do. 

Also, food is absolutely even more subjective. I would 1000% take a greasy big mac over an 8 course degustation menu at a michelin restaurant.
Ah, sorry I misunderstood. I do not agree with Ebert that games are not art, nor that his analogy is an indicator that games are not art at a fundamental level. It‚Äôs just an analogy that I think works well for explaining why certain games don‚Äôt work well from a storytelling point of view.
Which interview?
I think at the end of the day, if the gameplay feels like it's damaging a narrative, it's either bad design or it's a form of gameplay that people find boring or frustrating. I understand that completely. It's happened to me with a lot of good games. It's probably a bit of a plague in video games at the moment. IMO, open-world games have a place, but too many ruin their best narrative by breaking things up with the requirement to do random side events to progress enough for the rest of the story.

Any link to one of those articles? I already listened to that podcast

So you made it up about the articles. Many outlets would've quoted this if he actually backtracked.

He still stuck to the 10 movies thing in other podcasts that he did after this but he'll be doing some Tv shows and books.

"TIL that the U.S.A. leases the land for Guantanamo Bay naval base from Cuba for $4,085 a year thanks to a lease agreement from 1903 that has no expiration date. Since 1959, to protest the U.S. presence on the island, Cuba has not accepted a single payment",,https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_Naval_Base,"I wish some of the landlords I had previously protested my presence and not accepted any payments.
Is there any other country that has an active military base located *inside* the borders of an enemy or hostile country?
I had no idea that this concentration camp doubled as a naval base
Cool to be a prick and keep a 100+years old clerly outdated contract.
But hey, we talk about a base that do not fulfil any international law, shere people is toetured and kidnaped without any justification. Make america great again.
I wonder if there's a clause that states that if the US doesn't pay their lease, it is terminated or something. I know governments aren't run like it'd be in a Sit-Com (hopefully), so it shouldn't happen, but all it'd take is one forgetful intern to forget to sign that cheque, and Cuba's adding a couple 0s to that number.
Well Spain would argue that Gibraltar would be such a case
Also used for humanitarian reasons as well for Haitian and Cuban migrants. I was there in 92 for safeguarding the Haitians. In 94 they had Cubans there but they full out rioted and were roaming the base so they sent half to Panama where I was part of the group that safeguarded them there. The living situation for both groups was abysmal. Living on concrete slabs with tents and cots and just dealing with whatever weather came their way.

American Whiskey review #280

******************

**Heaven Hill Bourbon 2009 10 year TWCC Single Cask, 58.2%**

**Nose:** Butterscotch, corn, creme brulee, vanilla, light toasted wood, root beer char, spice. Creamy and desserty but still very much a Bourbon

**Taste:** Zingy corn, blast of hot cherry and spice, cinnamon, creamy caramel, funky buttered popcorn, soft sweet wood. It's spirity, a bit hot, with just a light creamy wood touch. Makes for an odd mix of flavors. Feels hot and a somewhat hollow

**Finish:** More spirity corn and creamy-sweet notes come back with fading spice. Herbal spice, cherry, musty wood, creamy caramel, funky buttered popcorn. 

*****************

It's fitting that this selection comes from Europe because it is a unique experience for a Bourbon. It has an almost Scotch-like light wood and creaminess to it, especially on the nose(which is the best part). But then there's a lot of spirity corn and spice heat on the palate, and along with the delicate wood notes it just doesn't add up well. It's good but it makes for an odd cacaphony of flavors. I might have even guessed this was a refill barrel Bourbon based on all the light wood and funky corn

Score: **5** 

1 | Disgusting | So bad I poured it out.

2 | Poor | I wouldn't consume by choice.

3 | Bad | Multiple flaws.

4 | Sub-par | Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.

5 | Good | Good, just fine.

6 | Very Good | A cut above.

7 | Great | Well above average

8 | Excellent | Really quite exceptional.

9 | Incredible | An all time favorite

10 | Perfect | Perfect .
I got burned on one of these before, I think it was around 9 years old and claimed to be HH bourbon. In reality, I‚Äôm pretty sure this may be overaged, over-proof HH corn whiskey (yep, Mellow Corn) that got labeled as bourbon due to lax labeling rules outside the US. Mellow Corn Supreme, if you will.
That makes sense. As I drank this, I found myself wondering how much they follow the proper ""Bourbon"" labeling rules over there. Because it just tasted very spirity and young despite the 10 year age statement
They 100 percent do not follow US labeling rules. Mine was from an indie bottler in Scotland, and the second I saw the color, I said, no way this spent a decade in new American oak. Like I said, most likely corn whiskey/second fill, your instincts were correct! Buyer beware.
100% corn mb can still be bourbon
Not when it‚Äôs aged in second-fill barrels.
sure, im just stating that just because it's 100% corn doesn't make it not bourbon"

**Taste:** Bold sweet corn front and center, brown sugar, hot cherry, musty wood, sweet toasted oak, herbal funk, vibrant spice. Big flavor without being overly hot. Has this thick syrupy mouthfeel where all the big flavors meld and balance together, but just enough heat to feel action-packed. This is really nice Bourbon. So much corn and sweet wood 

**Finish:** Caramel and bright citrus, corn, big toasted wood, sweet char, spice. It's fiercely classic-Bourbon-goodness all the way to the end

**************

I was never a big fan of Bookers. But now I'm not sure if my palate has grown or if maybe I just missed their heyday of stuff like this. Because this is really nice. It's a celebration of corn. The corn is front and center and it performs beautifully, bold but not even remotely hot or spirity or unpleasant. Just enough big sweet toasted wood to balance it all out with a thick syrupy mouthfeel.

It‚Äôs CORN!
Glad you enjoyed this. And thanks for the review, as always. I couldn't have come close to describing the tasting notes as splendidly as you did. Hard to imagine these were $49 back then.
Old Booker‚Äôs is the sh*t! My favorite.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a celebration of corn.‚Äù -Haven‚Äôt had any old batches like this, but this sums up why I‚Äôm still willing to occasionally pony up $100 for Booker‚Äôs. Sometimes I just want those big, bright, punchy, grain-forward flavors. I get similar vibes from younger craft stuff when it‚Äôs done well.
I guess at some point along the way the flavor profile of Booker‚Äôs turned from carmel corn to peanut butter?
I was not a huge fan. It wasn‚Äôt terrible, but for its price, I expected a bit more.
It‚Äôs got the juice!
Miss those days as well. Used to be something I always had on hand now now it's not just expensive but hard to find.
Well gee thanks! I remember trying bookers and just not caring for it, so I've never bought a bottle. But that was probably a few years after this one. Glad I got to try a good one

American Whiskey review #278

*******************

**Dancing Goat ""Limousin Rye"" 6 year r/Bourbon single barrel, brandy cask finish, 55.9%**

**Nose:** Butterscotch, green apple, caramel, Rye grain, clean rye spice, evergreen, strawberry. Fruity and sweet with bold rye

**Taste:** Beautiful clean rye grain, toffee, bright candy cherry, green apple, butterscotch, evergreen, big zingy rye spice that isn't overly hot at all. It's so bold and fruity and fun and the clean rye really cuts through in a delicious way. It drinks pleasant and balanced for all the lively flavor. Wow what a Rye

**Finish:** Evergreen, butterscotch, tart berry, long herbal rye spice carrying through all of it 

********************

There's too many r/Bourbon picks for me to keep track of these days, but this is one of the ones that I came closer to buying. Now I'm really kicking myself for not getting it because this is freaking delicious. I'm a big rye fan and this really hits the spot. I can't say that the brandy cask adds anything that I can specifically pin down, but the whole thing is so fruity and bright and sweet but still a very bold rye. I could definitely have gone for a full bottle of this

Cheers for the review!

I have a r/bourbon pick of a NULU bourbon finished in grape brandy. Similarly to you, I initially felt like the grape brandy really wasn‚Äôt doing much to add to the bourbon, but part of that was the fruitiness of the MGP base, as well as my unfamiliarity with brandy itself. Over time I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve gotten better at picking out the finish, and I think the NULU team and u/t8ke really nailed the balance there.
One of my locals did a honey barrel finish on this. I picked it up, but am waiting to open for the advent calendar a few of my friends and I are doing. This makes me pretty pumped to get into that bottle.
Finally someone reviewed this besides me! I found the 4 year of this in NC probably 2 years ago and grabbed it only because I liked the bottle. And was blown away how good it was. And just last month snagged the 6y that had a glencairn in the box. Such a fantastic rye. Perfect review of the profile. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever not have one on hand. Such a sleeper. Most people have never heard of it. I wish the distillery was closer because they have so many other products not available to me."

Scotch review #297

****************************

**Laphroaig Cairdeas 2022 ""Warehouse 1,"" 52.2%**

**Nose:** Heavy medicinal peat, vanilla, buttery wood, lemon, spice, creamy sweetness, frosting, brine, tropical fruit, peaty char.

**Taste:** Big medicinal peat, hits thick and clean, brine, buttery wood, vanilla custard, bright lemon, tropical fruit, spice. It's creamy and sweet and bright, feels like a happy Laphroaig but still a big medicinal peat monster. 

**Finish:** Vanilla, thick Frog peat, gritty brine and spice, buttery wood, sugary frosting and tropical fruits. Peaty creamy-sweet finish, medicinal peat lingers

**************************

As a huge Laphroaig fan, and someone who feels that the distillate really shines in a Bourbon barrel, I was super excited for this year's Cairdeas. And it has not disappointed. Easily my favorite Cairdeas since the 2015 for their 200th anniversary(also Bourbon barrel, and also aged in Warehouse 1). Actually I have a bottle of the 2015 open so I poured some to compare: 2015 is a meaner Laphroaig, which is funny because I never thought of it that way compared to something like the 10 Cask Strength. 2015 is more vanilla and char and spice. And more brine. 2022 feels softer, more creamy and sweet and friendly. Both are great, god I love Laphroaig

Loved this when I had it in Scotland. Been waiting and looking for it ever since I got back. I‚Äôve never had the 2015 version, so this one is my all-time favorite.
Nice review! I found this to be lacking mediciniality but suuuper salty. Nice to see you‚Äôre take on it!
I have been wondering how different this one is compared to the 10cs, especially batch 14, 13.  Been trying to limit my spending lately, would this one be that different?
Bourbon cask aged Laprhoaig, I wondered when we would be hearing from you on this one. I had some last weekend, so good. Great review. ""Vanilla, thick Frog peat..."" yup, you nailed it.
Good to read your review and your sbs with the 2015. Thanks for doing God's work:) Missed out on the 2015 and look forward to cracking this soon as a substitute. I'm always surprised how good the 2019 Triple is anytime I pour a dram. It may be my favorite Cairdeas so far. I have to be careful though, as I find that I gravitate towards Laphroaig or other peaty/smoky scotches lately. Once hooked, it takes hold of ya:) Makes me think the fondness for this will likely be off the charts 5 years from now.
[deleted]
My TW is raping people out here. $120. I don‚Äôt get it.
For me, Laphroaig is phenomenal. I got this one recently from duty free
I almost finish mine, it‚Äòs quite good, but not a Scotch that I will specifically search for again.
I opened mine in early August. And now about half way through bottle. Had a dram two days ago and the furniture polish notes I picked up initially are even more pronounced now. As unappealing as that may sound to some, I like it a lot. A really good bottle.
Dang. Picked up a bottle of this in Seattle (*!#* liquor tax!) for a friend yesterday. It's meant to be a Xmas present, but now I'm not so sure it will make it to him!
Have always liked Laphroaig, especially the Quarter Cask and the PX.... Looking forward to trying this-whether it's my bottle or his!
Usually in my Cairdeas reviews I like to rank them all as best I can, although it looks like I forgot last year. Keep in mind these are spanning almost 10 years and I'm going off memory for a lot of these. So maybe take it with a grain of salt

**2015 200th:** Simply the best

**2013 Portwood:** Special, nothing like it even if I do tend towards Bourbon barrel more

**2022:** Love me bourbon barrel Frog

**2021 PX:** Great dark sherried Laphroaig

**2019 Triplewood:** A fierce Laphroaig that balances the 3 casks great

**2018 Fino:** A nice delicate and sweet Frog

**2014 Amontillado:** Honestly don't remember it real well just remember liking it

**2017 Quarter Cask CS:** Didn't love it at first but it grew on me a bit

**2020 Port/Red Wine:** It was a mess

**2016 Madeira:** Sickly sweet, unbalanced, the worst by far
In the past I've seen cairdeas keep popping up all year, so hopefully you get one. At my store it never went out of stock, first time I've ever seen a cairdeas do that. I can't tell if they got more than usual or if demand is just lower this year
Yes this one is different. I haven't had those particular batches but generally I still think 10CS is the best Laphroaig, and one of the best scotches money can buy. 

I think of 10CS as more intense, bigger medicinal peat and vanilla/charred barrel influence. It can be more spirity with the tropical notes on less woody batches. They are bigger and hotter

This cairdeas is softer, still plenty of peat but more custardy and bright and sweet. Its softer and friendlier. So really personal preference
Ha you know me too well
2019 is up there with the best. It was my favorite since 2015, and its different enough from 2022 that they are hard to compare. It still holds it's own I think
Same here! Whoever is responsible for sourcing Islay Scotch at my local Costco or Costco in general deserves a raise.
My Costco in NorCal only has the Laphroaig Select.  Total bummer. That would be a great price.
Total wine does that. They open a bunch of stores in a region, establish a reputation for having the best prices and then once they‚Äôve dominated the market, they raise the prices. Total wine had the best prices in my state around 2016. Now they‚Äôre middling.
I don‚Äôt know how to add photos or links to my posts, I‚Äôm a newbie in this regard
Good summer whisky?
The tube of my 2015 says that it is made from 100% their own floor maltings.  Not certain if that is the claim also about the 2022.  



My 2015 will be gone soon.  I feel fortunate that I happened to taste it in a restaurant at its first release and bought a small supply.  Classic taste.

Nice to see a review come round again.  Thx.
Opened up a triple wood the other day.

It's got a helluva kick but the flavours are incredible.
Thank you for reviewing all these Cairdeas vintages. Also, thanks for the current Warehouse 1 review. 

I've been drinking Cairdeas since the 2013 vintage. Before I say this, I'd like to emphasize that everyone has their own reaction to a particular scotch, and that's what makes this hobby so interesting.

For me, however, the order of my most enjoyed Cairdeas would be as follows:

2020 Port and Wine - wish I'd bought two boxes.

2019 TW - A savory CS dram

2022 Bourbon cask WH 1 - tasty, and masculine - nailed the Laphroaig profile

2016 - Madeira - loved this finish, but was a bit on the thin side.

2015 200th anniversary - A solid Laphroaig, but not my favorite.

2013 - Yes it's legendary, but I like other Cairdeas more than this.

2021 PX - very nice, but the travel retail PX version is much better.

2014 - Amontillado - not memorable, can't remember if there actually was a noticeable wine finish

2018 Fino - would have rather skipped this one, it wasn't good

2017 - QC - forget about it. tasted like a mouth full of sawdust.

As I've written before, that's why they make chocolate and vanilla. Your results obviously vary.
This is a particularly useful review - I like the comparative nature of your descriptions it gives me a baseline for your observations. Thanks for posting - I have a bottle waiting for me to open at Christmas squirrelled away from my visit earlier this year :)
100% agree. I did a 10 CS (batch 11) SBS with the 2022 Cairdeas tonight. Both are excellent but the 10 CS is better suiting my palate tonight. More of the caramel sweetness and medicinal bandages combo. That said, I love the 2022 Cairdeas. It‚Äôs definitely softer, more briny, and more modern. Get both for your collection. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. Grab a 16 while you‚Äôre at it too.
Thanks for the thoughtful reply! Sound like a good one.
I mean they still do good in a lot of other bottles but sometimes I just scratch my head. Like y‚Äôall have WT101 rye for $18 but then pull this shit. Haha
But you‚Äôll have a play
No, the 2015 was special like that. 100% own cold-smoked floor maltings, distilled on their smallest still, aged in warehouse 1, and said to be just shy of 12 years old. The idea was to make a Laphroaig as it would have tasted 200 years ago for their anniversary
Ha we have very different tastes, but as you said that's part of what makes this fun. 2016 Madeira was the only release that I truly hated, and you have it above 2015 which is easily my favorite no contest
Very interesting, how would you rate the warehouse 1 vs  the recent 10 CS (say batches 13-15)?
People hate on the 2020 Cairdeas but I LOVED it.
Thanks, glad you found it interesting. Side-by-side comparisons are always fun and can be very educational
Cairdeas is fun as an annual release that gives you a different take on laphroaig, but there's just no competing with the 10CS the stuff is a beast
I bought 4 bottles of the 2015 Cairdeas. After I read your glowing commendation of it about a year or so ago, I opened my last bottle to see what I was missing. So essentially I drank that bottle with your tasting notes in mind, and, as much as I tried, I just didn't see it. I ended up giving a portion of that bottle to another redditor who never got to taste it. He also liked it better than I did. I would think that after 4 bottles of a particular expression something would have revealed itself to me. Still, I understand your viewpoint, which seems to have occurred in reverse for the 2020 Port and Wine.

&#x200B;

And now I'm going to pour myself some more of Warehouse 1. Good thing I still have another bottle of it, eh?
Wow, your reply came in a few days before this post closed for comments. I had to read over your ratings of the annual Cairdeas, and my ratings again. I would still rate the 2013-2022 the same as I did last year. There is a wide variance between our two experiences. 

I liked the warehouse 1 from 2022, and still have a bottle on the shelf which I'm looking forward to opening in a couple of months. I recently finished off a bottle of the 2023 Cairdeas, the madeira and white port finish. It was different, which, I gather, is what Laphroaig was going for. However, it wasn't that enjoyable until I got to the last 1/3rd of the bottle. Then it improved dramatically. Not sure why, but others have had the same result. 

I used to get a bottle of 10 CS every year. The first one I got was batch 005. (I think. Might have had a 004, but, at my age, my memory isn't that good anymore.)  I liked batch 006, 010, and 011. I got a few bottles of 011, and still have one around here somewhere. I bought a bottle of batch 012, but, unbelievably, I haven't opened it yet. I stopped buying Cask Strength Laphroaig for three reasons. First, I haven't gotten around to opening bottle 012 yet. Second, I have way too many unopened bottles of scotch now, thus too many choices when it comes to opening a new bottle. Third, as I now classifying myself as ""elderly,"" I have, accordingly, found that I am consuming less and less whisky. There are a few people in my life to whom I would bequeath my whisky collection, but there doesn't seem to be any purpose for continuing to build it, given that I may never be able to get to the last bottle. 

As a result, I cannot answer your question, because I have not had any ""recent"" CS Laphroaig. Having said that, I will say that the Warehouse 1 was a lot different from any of the Cask Strength Laphroaig I have had in the past. My recollection of Warehouse 1 was that it was distinctly ""masculine."" Seems a strange way to describe it, as, not to be sexist or anything like that, most whisky is masculine. But the Warehouse 1 was more so, in my opinion. (There are a number of scotch expressions that I would characterize as ""feminine,"" by the way. Balblair being a good example of them.) If you get a chance, I would  like to hear your answer to the question you posed. 

I saw that batch 016 CS in on the shelves here. Wondering if I should get one. Any ideas?
The people I know liked the 2020 Cairdeas fine. We all wish we had bought more, but didn't realize how much we loved it at the time."

**Taste:** Toffee, smooth toasted wood, honey, vanilla, nuttiness, spice, subtle grape, floral. It's a rich woodiness but it hits soft and sweet. Flavor just glides along on the palate with a silky mouthfeel. Not very tannic at all which is interesting given the age

**Finish:** Brighter red fruits build, then milk chocolate draws out, nutty wood, toffee, vanilla. The silky mouthfeel draws out

*************

Another excellent Cognac from Grosperrin (to no one's surprise). ""Smooth classy oak"" came to mind while drinking this. It's a sweet woodiness, honey and toffee and nuttiness not very tannic for how old it is. It's soft and silky smooth but not in a boring way. The flavor just lands perfectly. It's what I've come to expect from their Cognacs and so far they never disappoint.

**Nose:** Caramel, red wine, tart red apple, herbal notes, brine, toned down pomace, chalky sweetness, anise and hot spice, estery, perfume, soft wood and even chocolate. Complex and so damn interesting

**Taste:** Caramel, smooth wood, big fruity plum and grape, herbal, only a very slight pomace funkiness that hits strong enough to give it a little character without being the main attraction, caramel, smooth spice, mint. Smooth rich wood influence here, warm sweet fruits, this almost drinks like a proper brandy and not a big crazy marc. Almost

**Finish:** Sweet wood, toffee, bright tart fruits and floral notes, delicious spice, smooth pomace, lingering rancio and chalky candy. Long and flowing, beautiful finish 

************************

Well this is the least Marc-like Marc that I've had. It's delicious. It could almost pass for a slightly funky regular brandy I think, but there is still enough pomace character to let you know it's a Marc. Amazing complexity that is all very well balanced, with nice smooth wood notes and bold warm fruits. Really digging this one more than the other Marcs but it feels like it's cheating because it's so brandy-like."

**Taste:** Caramel, toasted wood, tart zingy pomace, brine, sweet tart berries, green apple, red licorice, chalky candy, herbal. The pomace character is balanced out by soft caramel wood notes. Super drinkable, strong Marc character but not in a challenging way. 

**Finish:** Green apple, tart pomace, caramel, soft toasted wood, sweet berries, brine

*******************

I tend to be a bigger fan of wood-aged Pomace brandy and this is a perfect example of why. The funky Marc character is prominent but at the same time softened beautifully by warm toffee wood notes.

**Mette Marc d'Alsace Gewurtztraminer, 45%**

**Taste:** Sweet fruity grape, tart pomace, chalky candy, bright fruits of apple and pear, citrus, smooth herbal notes that are well-integrated. Definitely has that pomace funk but it's more balanced than other Marc I've had, gives it a nice clean mouthfeel. Drinks sweet and pleasant and funky

**Finish:** Tart fruits, bright sweet berry, grape, light sweet chalky candy, fruity and sweet candy finish

***********************

I tend to prefer wood-aged marc but this might be my favorite clear one I've had. It feels especially fruity and sweet, less crazy and more approachable. But still enough of that funky pomace character to celebrate the zany uniqueness of the style. I don't think I will be scoring these, they are just too unique and hard to pin down in that way
In case you or anyone else is unfamiliar with wine and grape varietals, gewurztraminer is one of the loudest personality white grapes out there. But it's also low in acid which can make for flabby still wines. This makes gewurztraminer sort of a difficult choice for distilling, but working with the pomace helps.

So I'm not surprised this is absolutely weird in very pleasant ways. As the world embraces white agave spirits and white rums, I have high hopes for marc and those from Alsace
Ever tried the Guillemot Michel Marc de Bourgogne  Sophie?
No I have not. Honestly, my experience with Marc/Grappa is very limited. I've tried a few and didn't care for it much. I think these are my first reviews of any except for Humbrecht Gewurztraminer 1976"

**Taste:** Big arrival of dry tannic oak, dark sweetly toasted wood, cherry wood, heavy vanilla, tobacco, bold fruity grape, smooth wood spice. This is big tannic oak, favors the darker side but there's also sweeter notes and bold fruit. Thick luscious mouthfeel, very cohesive. Tastes old but not over-oaked or boring at all. Woody tannic grape juice

**Finish:** Tobacco, smooth darkly toasted wood, cherry wood, vanilla, dank oak, lingers into drying tannins, wood spice, grape

********************

Overall it's more dark and tannic, but it has a little bit of everything. Lots of vanilla and sweeter toasted oak to smooth it out, just enough bold grape shining through. It's all very cohesive with a thick mouthfeel. Great dark woody showcase of the super-old age without being overly tannic and dry.

**Taste:** Big warming fruits with a thick smooth mouthfeel, strawberry, raisin, fig, sweet jammy fruits, light tartness, rich toffee, strong wood, slightly tannic, barrel char, big malty thickness, wood spice. It's all woven together into this thick elegant wave of flavor. It feels so soft, yet huge and flavorful at the same time. Effortlessly well balanced. Flirts with the darker side of things but still lots of fruity sweetness. The flavor just hits perfectly it feels so right

**Finish:** The fruits lift up brighter and sweeter, strawberry, cherry, plum, some darker fruits, rich sweet caramel, toasted wood, stays elegantly thick and well-balanced all the way through without an off note to be found. Lingering warm dark fruits and holiday spice

***********************

Put simply, this is about as good as a heavily sherried Scotch gets. I have a complicated relationship with sherried Scotch. I used to hate it, and while I have learned to love it I can still be kind of picky and have to be in the right mood for it. Too many sherry bombs just feel like they are wine-saturated. They are either sickly-sweet, sulfury, or maybe just kind of unbalanced and wine-soaked. This Benrinnes, as much of a sherry-bomb as it is, still feels very much like a Scotch. It has that thick malty backbone, no heat or harshness. The fruits hit the spot and land perfect. It's huge and complex but all wrapped up into this elegant, silky-smooth package.

Fun review! Sometimes I wonder if this bottling would have generated the same kind of buzz and 100/100 scores around here if it came out in 2022 instead of a decade ago.  But it's not even a realistic hypothetical, since something like this wouldn't even be released today at the price that it was back then.  This is sherried whisky from a bygone era that's for sure.
Oh man, this is *that* Benrinnes.
Love the deep ruby hue
Nice! This bottling is a white whale now.
That‚Äôs a healthy ABV for the age! Amazing
Awesome review! I was able to taste a sample of this from a super generous friend and had a very similar experience and opinion as you. What a stellar bottle
Thanks for the review. My thoughts of this aligns with yours from the sample I tried. I can see myself killing a bottle of this in one week, despite how rich it is. This and the famous State of NH Glendronach 19yr Cask #3292 from around 2017/18 rank amongst the best sherried scotches I've ever had. I hope we get to experience bottles like this again in future.
This sound amazing....

Man I need to actually get around to finding a bottle of this somewhere....
Damn, lucky you
Yep it is that one!
It's a stock photo but I used this one because it's the one that best matched the color of the whisky in my glass"

**Nose:** Bold dark fruits, black cherry, tart berries, chocolatey grape, toffee, thick vanilla, wood spice, mint, deep rich wood, toasted oak, chocolate, dark and slightly tannic, graham cracker. Cohesive bold and rich

**Taste:** Rich toasted oak, chocolatey and smooth with just the right amount of tannic bight, thick vanilla, toffee, dark fruits emerge from the woody richness, black cherry, chocolatey grape, graham cracker, minty spice. Rich chocolatey wood with an undercurrent of dark tart fruits, slightly tannic, all well balanced. Thick mouthfeel and big bold flavor

Has everything I love about Le Freche, smoothed out with chocolatey and tannic richness. Not as punchy as some of the Encantada stuff I've had but it's still plenty big.

**Hontambere (Pouchegu) 1983 39 year, barrel G3, 55.7%**

**Nose:** Dark, dense, and powerful. Hot black cherry, tobacco, rancio, burnt grape, dark toasted wood, vanilla, hot spice, tannic wood

**Taste:** Tons of dark dense heat like the nose, but more toffee and caramel sweetness come through with it. Tobacco, burnt grape, syrupy black cherry, toffee, hot spice, dark tart fruits, strong darkly toasted wood, vanilla. It's big, hits strong and a little hot like a Bourbon but with tons of syrupy sweetness and thick mouth-coating flavor

**Finish:** Toffee, tobacco, dark sweet toasted wood, rancio, burnt grape and black cherry, barrel char, lingering sweet hot cherry and spice

**************

These Pouchegus are such powerful Armagnacs. Lots of heat, dense with dark sweet flavor and rancio. This reminds me more of the latest round of K&L picks, which were more hot and brash than the earlier Rare Armagnac Collection releases. Great stuff if you like a thick Armagnac with some heat behind it.

Great review. Damn, not gonna stumble across this one, it seems. The Pouchegus that I have (84, 87) really stand out with their spice. I like the 84 by itself better but the 87 pairs with cigars better; probably the best cigar drink I have had aside from black coffee. Would love an 83 vintage for my birth year, seems to never be around."

**L'Encantada Domaine Le Freche #130, 1989 29 year 50.2%**

**Nose:** Dark brooding fruit, burnt grape, berries, dark toasted wood, fudgy chocolate, toffee, thick vanilla, minty spice. Dark, brooding, chocolatey, fruity and thick

**Taste:** Sweet toasted wood, caramel, vanilla, dark chocolatey grape, black cherry, blackened oak, mint, with a lot of air time some sweeter candied grape/cherry and bigger sweet wood notes emerge. It's almost muted at first, and it takes a LOT of air time to start opening up. Even then, it still has a quiet mellow character. Not hugely bold or complex, it's just this smooth wave of dark brooding sweetness with chocolate and fruits and sweet wood

**Finish:** Fruity grape, vanilla, dark sweetly toasted wood, brighter minty spice. Comes alive jut a bit more on the finish

*********************

I'm a big fan of Le Freche and I've had quite a few, some I liked better than others. But I haven't had one quite like this. It's a quiet Le Freche. I'm used to these being very bold. It feels muted at first, but with significant air time it does open up a little bit more. A hard one to score because what *is* there is delicious, it's just so quiet almost to the point of being muted. It's not a bottle I regret buying. I enjoy it for what it is and I'm looking forward to it hopefully opening up more since it has already come a long way

**Taste:** Bold fruits of grape and black cherry, caramel, orange, floral notes, sweet toasted wood, charred oak, vanilla, light tannins and rancio. Delicious and it has a little bit of everything. Great heavy toasted wood notes and caramel, bold fruits, and just a touch of char and rancio to keep it interesting. Very well-balanced, and does great at about 45%. Feels super drinkable but not overly light

**Finish:** Big sweet toasted wood, caramel, sweet fruity grape, vanilla, smooth tannins. Tasty and drinkable to the end

********************

I've only had the first edition XO before this, I really liked it but this one is even better. Does a great job of capturing everything I love about Armagnac: The punchy flavor, big heavily toasted wood and vanilla, rich caramel, bold fruits, the sweetness and body, and puts it all into an extremely well-balanced and super drinkable little package. XO 1 felt like it was geared towards beginners not just to Armagnac, but neat spirits in general. It was just so light. This one still makes for a great introduction to Armagnac, but it packs a little bit more of a punch. It's something anyone can enjoy sipping on.

**Nose:** Fruity grape, mahogany, smooth toasted wood, caramel, light soy sauce rancio, vanilla, tart berries, floral, smooth wood spice. Smooth and sweet

**Taste:** Sweet syrupy caramel, soy sauce, toasted wood, vanilla, floral, grape. Was expecting some age and heavy oak, and this isn't like that at all. It's sweet and easygoing, more caramel and sweet lightly toasted wood and fruit with that wonderful soy sauce rancio character that seems to be their signature. Like all the others, the rancio seamlessly melds in 

**Finish:** Soy sauce, caramel, sweet toasted wood, tart berry. Fruity and sweet with lingering rancio

************************

Not what I was expecting from something this old. It's light and sweet, the 1990 I tried before this was darker and older feeling. And the 1990 also felt much bigger overall at a similar strength. This is delicious and very pleasant though, and still drinks great at about 41%. Cask variation like this where age doesn't tell the whole story is always fun. I love that the big rancio character comes through on all these different bottlings, it gives Aurensan a very unique and interesting feel. And delicious too. Not just the rancio itself, but the way it effortlessly melds in on all of these and feels so elegantly well-balanced. I can say I'm a fan of this Domaine.

**Nose:** Balsamic, dark sweetly toasted wood, big vanilla, toffee, black licorice, mint, coffee, fruity grape, light wood spice. Delicious and inviting, darkly sweet, super cohesive

**Taste:** Rich toffee, chocolate, light soy sauce and balsamic notes, tart berry, smooth dark toasted wood, tons of vanilla, slightly drying wood on the tail end. Amazingly rich flavor at 40% but still every bit as smooth as you would expect, makes for an extremely drinkable combo. Dark and sweet with a beautiful touch of soy/balsamic rancio

**Finish:** Light soy sauce rancio, sweet toasted wood, vanilla, smooth sweet caramel, grape 

*******************

This cask is a winner. The distinctive rancio notes that are on full display in the 20 and 30 ans bottlings are toned down here. And where the 20/30 ans were distinctly soy sauce-y to me, this one is more balsamic, the whole thing just feels darker and sweeter overall. Tons of vanilla and sweet barrel notes, not especially fruity but there's enough grape and tart berry coming through so you know it's an Armagnac. Cohesive and elegant. Very impressed with how well this does at 40% too. I easily might have guessed this as 46% blind

**Nose:** Charred wood, soy sauce rancio, tart berry, burnt grape, smoothing vanilla, toffee, mint, toasted marshmallow, cacao, wood spice

**Taste:** That same smooth soy sauce rancio that the 20 ans had, but some darker wood notes here. Rancio melds beautifully with toffee, tart berry, dark toasted wood, heavy vanilla, slightly drying oak, caramel, grape, sweet char. Elegant and richly balanced even with the heavy rancio, a nice oily mouthfeel like the 20 ans had

**Finish:** Sweet toasted oak and vanilla, toffee, smooth wood spice, just a hint of soy sauce, sweet char

******************

This is very similar in character to the 20 ans, rancio and fruit and sweet wood notes all elegantly balanced together. It shows it's older age with darker wood notes and a little more spice but it's not dramatically different. It's very cool to know that they have this consistent profile to their stuff because it is delicious and very unique. I'm a fan.

I'm having trouble picking a favorite between the 20 and 30, they each have their strengths. 30 might edge ahead just a touch, because I tend to prefer darker wood notes but it's more personal preference. Both are great

Nice - I really love the younger Aurensan bottlings I've had so far. If you don't mind sharing, did you pick this up domestically or internationally?
Awesome review! I love the 30 ans and 20 ans, and the profile they go for. The previous bottling of 20 ans I liked even more than the newer one (although those were bar pour impressions).
I didn't pick them up, I tried these from a friend. Not sure where they got them from sorry
I got the 30 ans while I was working in the UK, and sent bucky this sample. Picked it up from Hedonism wine co and flew it back in a checked bag.
No worries!

Bold and invigorating rye but thickly well-balanced with maple and brown sugar wood notes, fiercely rye

**Taste:** Toffee, invigoratingly bold dill & freshly cut herbs, big clean rye grain, chocolate mint, brown sugar, smooth sweetly toasted wood, maple, mellow peppery rye spice. Has a thick oily mouthfeel. Creamy wood notes with tons of clean herbal rye coming through, tons of dill, all extremely well-balanced and melded.

**Finish:** Dill builds big and bold with smooth peppery rye spice, clean rye grain, toasted brown sugar oakiness, maple, cherry, mint. Sweet and dilly with tons of clean rye 

******************

I'm a huge fan of MGP rye, and his is some of the best I've had in a long time. I used to love the 7-10 year Smooth Ambler Old Scout and Willett single barrels, and have been lamenting the loss of quality single barrels ever since those disappeared. Nashville Barrel Company has been doing great stuff with their 8 year barrels but can be a little inconsistent, and never seem to bring this dill-heavy herbal profile very well. Actually, no MGP rye seems to bring the dill anymore which used to be their signature profile. Well this one makes up for lost time, it is possibly the most dill-heavy MGP rye I've ever had and it makes me happy. With the age it is not super oaky but it is extremely well-balanced with creamy sweet wood notes and big clean rye flavor, and has a nice thick oily mouthfeel. These are the kinds of barrels that remind me why I love Rye so much

Not too light and not too hot, it's just the right abv for wonderful flavor and mouthfeel with a smooth easy presentation. Very crushable

**Finish:** Sweet sugary corn, big toasted oak, toffee, touch of tobacco and smooth tannins, cinnamon spice, cherry, vanilla. Sweet and woody finish

*****************

All hype aside, this is such a solid Bourbon. Exactly the kind of archetypal profile that comes to mind when I think ""Bourbon."" Really nice wood notes, clean corn, lots of creamy and toasted sweetness. I've only had one other batch before and I felt very much the same way. It's just so satisfying. I think the abv is so perfect, it kicks things up a notch from 101, nice thick mouthfeel, but still stays in that smooth territory. Best of both worlds.

Absolutely. As we get into the higher end wheated BT Mashbill, it‚Äôs hard not to just benchmark them as the quintessential well done bourbon 

I love ORVW10, personally I like it much better than Lot B, those extra proof points really help
Good one. I rated it an 8 too, even though it was from a bar pour. WLW was a 9, but that was more expected. People love crapping on Old Rip but few wheaters hit the spot the way this one does.
I had a pour of this a few years ago in Vegas. Was my first experience with a Van Winkle, and it was absolutely worth the $40. It‚Äôs a wonderful bourbon.
Paging u/RealRandallJohnson
Super dumb question, when in the year does old rip release?
So is this just Weller 107 with a couple extra years on it
Oh, no big deal. Just another unicorn bottle I'll never even see in person that lucky OP got for $90 and [lists for sale on secondary market around $2,200.](https://caskcartel.com/products/old-rip-van-winkle-2021-handmade-bourbon-whiskey)

Damn right I'm jealous.
Just let me have a half ounce. üòÇ
[removed]
Seen some people say Buffalo Trace fits the bourbon profile their mind conjures.
To me, BT is fruity. I like it a lot, let me say.
But being raised on so many bottom shelfers, the quintessential bourbon profile to me is probably ECBP, Jim Beam or old forester. Something earthier.
Will definitely seek out a sample or a bar with this. I like your reviews and I normally pass on ORVW at a bar because of price and other allocated items worth trying.
My mom won a bottle of this last fall and gifted it to me. Absolutely fantastic!

I've never had anything ""better"", so for me personally it's setting the bar at 10.
Yeah‚Äîsaw it for $1,149, would love to pull the trigger for my son!
Definitely like this more than Lot B
It‚Äôs a great pour. I only crap on the notion that it‚Äôs worth $800 or whatever silly prices get kicked around. Unless you really don‚Äôt care about the money, fuggetaboutit.
Mmmm gotta love a good WHEATER
All the big annual bourbon releases like van winkle and btac come out in the fall. Happy cake day!
Like the other comment said, there are differences even if the mashbill is the same(news to me that there's debate). Same way that Stagg and EH Taylor are different despite being the same mashbill. They look for certain flavor profiles in different brands and have different ways of aging and selecting to achieve that
There is debate about if it‚Äôs the exact same mash bill as weller. What we know is there are differences in barrel management and selection & that Rip is coming from a smaller number of barrels. Plus, as you mention, 2-4 extra years in barrel.

All that said, there‚Äôs only a $20ish difference in MSRP between the bottles.
My local guy got me a bottle of this at Christmas for $90.  Good whisky, and worth $90, but not as good as the CEHT BP that I got earlier in the year for $80.  CEHT BP is the best bourbon I've ever had, hands down.  I happened to be in a place in Sykesville, Md earlier this year. They had a very nice high-end bourbon selection, but the prices were nuts. 2oz pours:

ORVW 10 - $35
PVW 12 - $50
PVW 15 - $85


I did see that CEHT BP that I paid $80 for, in a case at a different store for $500
Sorry you feel this way, although it does make things easier for you. I quite liked it
There is no such thing as Pappy 10
I‚Äôd agree for the price there are much better options. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôd drink it all day everyday but not a real good value.
I also did not care for the harshness at first, but wasn‚Äôt bad after letting an ice cube melt in it a little.  Still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth what it‚Äôs going for on the secondary market.  Really didn‚Äôt care for Lot B.  I do look forward to trying Pappy 15 at some point in my life, even if it‚Äôs an overpriced ounce at a fancy restaurant or whiskey bar.
Fair enough but I try not to weigh secondary pricing into how I feel about a whiskey, too much variance out there and everyone has their comfort level, obviously.
You hit the nail on the head. People who pay that don‚Äôt care about the money. They have lots of it and they‚Äôd rather have the 50 most famous whiskies than a boat or whatever. Or maybe the just have both!
Thanks on both fronts!
Or as someone just told me, Weller 107 in a Cognac bottle /s
There should be no debate. I don‚Äôt have the link but some discussion with Julian on Straightbourbon confirmed that BT only has one wheated bourbon mashbill for Weller and Van Winkle products
Are we talking secondary prices, or holy shit I just hit a lottery and got it at MSRP price?
To be fair, this one IS personal for me. Old Rip was my daily after college in the early 00‚Äôs, always on the shelf, no big deal.  

Def great stuff and I wish it was still around for normal prices, but at the same time no one ever wet themselves or lost their mind when I poured drinks back in the day, lol.
And if you're still in NC, each county decides how they do special releases, if they get special releases.  Most that do organize a lottery either in person or often on facebook.  Yes, seriously, facebook SMH.  You can check the county ABC's website, but not all are very updated so if it's not there just ask in a store.  It'll probably be November or early December.  There is zero reason to not participate, it's free to sign up and prices are retail.  The odds of getting a Winkle are super low, but there is zero risk.
I definitely feel it's a nice step up from any Weller offering (absent WLW). Barrel management IMO is more significant than age or mashbill. Nice review by the way!
That‚Äôs cool. I‚Äôve seen several mainstream articles that have said there are slight variations in mashbill but if BT had said it explicitly then that answers that.
I‚Äôm wondering the same thing. The idea that ORVW isn‚Äôt worth 70-90 at MSRP is MORE ludicrous than thinking it‚Äôs worth 900 on secondary. 

I‚Äôve had maybe 400 whiskies and Old Rip would be in top 25 easily.
Did you actually read what I said? There may be thousands who get it at 90 but MANY of those individuals turn around and resell it at a much higher price. Even if they kept it for themselves that‚Äôs maybe at best 5-10% of the demand.
I was fortunate to get one 7 years ago at 100 and more recently a bottle of the 15 yr at 230 but I was in the right place at the right time on both occasions.
The vast majority of people are getting secondary market bottles. I‚Äôm not even sure what retail is at this point as a majority of good bottles have jumped significantly this past year (Michters 10year is around 175 retail). Where are you getting this bottle for 70 bucks?
Hey, as much as I love it, it‚Äôs still just whiskey in the end, no need to wet anything! At least you still caught it when it was available, which you can‚Äôt say about most folks getting into the hobby today. And while there is a lot more selection now, there is just no substitute for age and quality, and it is less common than it used to be. Hope you come across your favorite at a decent price again, cheers!
Sweet, thanks a million. I wonder if there are any counties that say fuck it and just put the stuff on the shelf lol.
Get your panties out of a bunch my dude. I'm fully aware of how shit works. Maybe you could've specified whether you meant MSRP or secondary and you wouldn't have had to get all butthurt over nothing.
There are thousands of people who get it for that price every year. Look at OP who got it for 90.

I‚Äôve never been so lucky myself, but if it‚Äôs a discussion of value, the cost needs to be articulated. I‚Äôve not met anyone who thinks it‚Äôs a good value at secondary pricing. People may buy it anyways if they don‚Äôt care about getting a good value.

Brandy review #131

*******************

**Michel Forgeron Cognac Hors d'Age, 50%**

**Nose:** Caramel, orange citrus, honey, musty wood, black cherry, floral, wood spice, mint. Very even-keeled, nothing hits too hard. Orange citrus and caramel flirting with darker wood notes

**Taste:** Musty antique wood, caramel, drying tannins, vanilla, orange, lightly floral, building wood spice. Elements of darker wood but there's sweetness and citrus all balanced well together. It's a rich yet very smooth and drinkable mouthfeel, feels much much lower than 50%.

**Finish:** Smooth spice layer, calms down into toasted wood, vanilla, orange citrus, floral notes, orange caramel, lingering drying wood and vanilla

*********************

Really nice combination of just slightly darker tannic wood notes and floral citrusy caramel. It drinks so smoothly for 50%, I might have guessed it as a sippable 45-47%. It could maybe use just a little more oomph but all the flavor lands beautifully. I'm especially loving all the orange citrus, it's such a delicious interplay of flavors with the darker wood. Like the 2005 I tried before this, it's very enjoyable but I wouldn't buy a bottle

**Michel Forgeron Cognac 2005 16 year, 47%**

**Nose:** Creamy and buttery, butterscotch, custard, buttery wood, sweet floral notes and honey, orange blossom, gentle wood spice. Elegant, complex, what a delight

**Taste:** Caramel, buttery wood, muted tart grape, orange, gentle floral notes, honey, slightly drying wood. It feels gentle. Missing the thickness that the nose had, but everything here is tasty. 

**Finish:** Light butterscotch, gentle wood spice, honey, gentle floral notes. It's good but the finish kind of fizzles out unfortunately  

************************

This stuff is showcasing what a delight a young, lightly wooded profile can be. It's all creamy and floral with light buttery wood, and surprisingly light on the fruits. Main complaint is the finish is lacking. Not something I would buy but it's nice to sip on

EDIT: Just realized this might be Folle Blanche, maybe that explains some of it's unique character. It's such a delicate almost muted fruitiness. I don't know enough about the varietals to say if this is a Folle Blanche thing or just how this bottle is

American Whiskey review #275

******************

**Redemption Rye (MGP) 18 year, 54.95%**

**Nose:** Thick maple, mint, toffee, smooth herbal rye spice, musty wood, dill, cinnamon, butterscotch. Thickly smooth with bold rye. Surprisingly it's not super woody at all it's more maple-y 

**Taste:** A surprising amount of sharp rye notes hit: pine, cinnamon, sharp rye grain, herbal rye spice, settles into green apple, cherry, butterscoth, maple, dill smooth layer of rye spice permeating. Like the nose it's really not very woody at all, these were some mellow casks. Tons of rye comes through with maple and butterscotch wood. If the age does anything here it just feels balanced and smooth but still with a nice thick mouthfeel

**Finish:** Sweet toasted wood, cherry, smooth bold rye grain, dill, light cinnamon and herbal spice

**************************

A great MGP rye. Big clean rye notes coming through, including that dill that I used to really love in MGP stuff but seems to be lacking in most bottlings these days. And it's so well-balanced with age. It's actually surprisingly light on the wood, which is maybe why it was able to age for 18 long years. Must have been some mellow conditions. I know I wouldn't have paid $400 for this 3 or 4 years ago, and even now with my spending habits being quite a bit higher I don't think it's epic enough that I would spend that kind of money ttoday. It would be tempting though, I only did a sample and I could see it really growing on me if I was able to explore it more.

Thanks for the review, as usual. If the 10yr Barrel Proof is as good as it is, I can only imagine how matured this would taste. I'd be happy to shell out the bucks for this than several other bottlings that go for similar amounts on secondary. Bravo!
What a treat to try
Dang, that sounds good. I just picked up a 14 year MGP rye for about half the cost of that sucker. Had a brief taste but am looking forward to really digging into it.
What bottle/brand? Didn't know MGP was still releasing 14 year ryes to the public
They aren't. 2 liquor store owners near me were able to procure about 30 barrels privately and bottled them. Here's a  link to a video about it https://youtu.be/5nS-E9WXiJw
That's insane and that's a LOT of barrels, those liquor stores must have been very good to MGP because I can't think of MGP doing this for many people
I don't think they got them direct from MGP.  I believe they bought them from someone else who had bought them from MGP awhile back"

**************************

**Cardinat 1981 34 year, 49%**

**Taste:** Dark fruits, plum, black cherry, chocolate grape, fudgy chocolate, dark heavily toasted wood, tons of vanilla, toasted marshmallow. Thick dark fruits, chocolatey toasted wood and vanilla

**Finish:** Dark drying wood, light soy sauce, toasted wood, vanilla, grape, burnt black cherry. Less fruity and more dry than the nose, tons of thick toasted wood and vanilla with light rancio. And scrumptious fruity grape that somehow doesn't get buried in all the darkness. Dark but not in a bitter tannic way.

**Taste:** Vanilla, burnt charred wood, lingering chocolatey grape

********************

Another great Cardinat. They do really well playing with dark flavors but not feeling over-oaked or tannic. I love the delicious candy fruitiness and bubblegum type notes that always come through. This one is like chocolate-covered grapes. I think I liked the 84 just a little bit more, but it's really close. I wish I had done them together to really see for sure

**Longmorn 2010 10 year ""Hart Brothers"" K&L pick, sherry butt 56%**

**Nose:** Butterscotch, honey, nuttiness, toffee, waxy malt, gentle tart fruits, subtle dark cherry. Butterscotchy and malty with light sweet fruits. It's all very gentle but pleasantly sweet

**Taste:** Honey, sweet fruits, caramel, waxy malt, subtle tart berry and dark cherry that melds, smooth wood, light spice. Subtle sweet fruitiness, honey, and malt with just a touch of darker caramel and toffee. Has a smooth cohesive mouthfeel. Very pleasant easy-sipper

**Finish:** Woody caramel, butterscotch, waxy malt, subtle sweet red fruits, some toffee and light char on the tail end

*********************

One of the writeups on K&L says this is first fill sherry but I would not have guessed. This doesn't smack you in the face with sherry at all, the fruits are more of a sweet undercurrent with all the caramel and honeyed malt.

Nice review!  This one sounds quite nice.
Oh wow, I have a bottle of this exact cask! It's really good stuff. Has everything you would want in a youngish sherried malt. I even got like a strawberry candy note out of it. I'll have to write up a review on it soon.
Sounds fantastic. That‚Äôs my kind of malt. You‚Äôre lucky to have access to K&L. They seem to have a nice selection.
They do a LOT of Scotch picks and many don't land, so it's tricky to navigate them. The prices are usually pretty good so when you do find a good one it's great.
my guess when i tried it was this isn't PX or oloroso like usual. might be fino or manzanilla."

**Nashville Barrel Company Rye (MGP) 9 year Bourbon Finds ""Magnum,"" 60.46%**

**Nose:** Herbal Rye, pine, maple, toffee, smooth minty spice, green apple, vanilla, sharp and herbal and a little metallic

**Taste:** Herbal and spicy, hot cinnamon cherry, big vibrant rye spice, toffee, tobacco, minty rye, sweet toasted oak, mouth-numbing menthol and minty rye spice. A great spicy rye. It's hot but there is no youthful harshness here at all so you can really enjoy it in all it's spicy glory

**Finish:** Mint, evergreen, clean rye grain, toffee, cinnamon cherry, lingering mouth-numbing menthol and minty rye-spice

**********************

I have to be honest, with this being the first 9 year I've had I was hoping for it to show it's age a little better with some richer oak notes. I do still love a brash and spicy rye and this one does do it well. And it's old enough to be an enjoyable hot and spicy with a great mouthfeel, no harshness or youthful astringency. But I wanted more depth and oak that I know age can bring to these. I'm nitpicking a little but considering the drastic price jump for this extra year of age I feel entitled. It's a great Rye but not any better than the many 8 year NBC ryes I've had that are way less money

That maple pine note on MGP rye always wins my heart
Nashville gets their barrels from Willet and MGP for their rye barrels
Great review. I totally agree with your sentiment regarding the price increase. I‚Äôve enjoyed every nbc bottle I‚Äôve tried (I have way too many at this point). But going from 90-110 for an 8 year to 170-180 for a 9 year is insane. The 2 9‚Äôs I‚Äôve tried have both been middle of the pack compared to the 8‚Äôs.
How's the mouth feel? While I like MGP Ryes for the green herbal notes I always find them a bit thin.
A 7 for 170? Woof
I hate it when this happens. High expectations for an expensive bottle and then average results.   I‚Äôm also a fan of NBC (MGP) products but it‚Äôs a craps shoot sometimes.  Maybe it‚Äôll change for the better. Thanks for the review.
Have you had the Sagamore offerings that are still MGP sourced?  I find that they have the best MGP offerings around however as they released an 8 year I actually found it to become a little boring and I prefer the younger cask strength and double oak offerings but am interested in trying the NBC stuff
Just found a store with about 30 bottles of NBC 8yr for $99.  These are from 2020.  Rock candy.  Fantastic bottle but not at the top of the echelon but great for the price.  I'll be back for more
MGP rye can have such different profiles, I have two 6 years, one tastes 4 years old and the other tastes 9 in terms of oak influence.
Decent mouthfeel, it's pretty hot so I wouldn't call it thick or anything. But very robust flavor
Nice! What store is it?"

Scotch review #294

**Benriach 2006 15 year ""Hart Brothers"" K&L pick, 1st fill port pipe 56.5%**

**Nose:** Dark rich and fruity, dark cherry, berries, plum, chocolate, toasted wood, root beer, toffee, vanilla. 

**Taste:** Dense dark flavor, burnt wood, toffee, spice, root beer, dark tart berries, mint, cacao. A wall of dark flavor, it's good but a bit closed. Fruits are hiding in the woody darkness. Water softens it but doesn't do much to open it up

**Finish:** Building spice, settles into toffee, charred wood, spiced tart fruits

*******************

Nose is a zinger of classic ported Scotch, but then it just ends up a little too closed on the palate I think. It hits as a wall of dark flavor with some background tart fruits. Nothing bad or offensive going on here though, it's a fine Scotch. Especially if you want something darker in a woody and toffee kind of way that flirts with fruitiness.

I felt the same way with the Hart Brothers Glen Ord 8 yr. It had a solid core of sherry notes but didn‚Äôt developed anything too complex.
Thanks for the review.  Have you tried either of the other Hart Benriachs they have? If so, how do they compare?  I'm looking to grab a few more bottles of something from K&L soon and had been eying these. Little bummed the 15yr didn't score higher.
have you tried this since? wondering if it just needed time to open up
No I havent tried the other benriachs sorry. This one was pretty good but just not quite there, especially for the price
No, I tried it from a 2oz sample so this was it sorry
Gotcha. Anything currently at K&L, scotch or otherwise,  that you've really liked?
I've heard the glen ord 8 is a decent sherry bomb, havnt had it yet myself. I thought the longmorn 10 was decent, nothing amazing but probably worth the price. Not much help scotch-wise haha sorry. If you wanted to try some armaganc they have cobrafire evil force for a great price on sale
Thanks. Never heard of cobra fire evil force but I do enjoy armagnac (and cognac) so I'll take a look.

Scotch review #293

****************

**Talisker 2009 11 year ""Old Particular"" K&L pick, refill hogshead 59.6%**

**Nose:** Lemon citrus, custard, clean smoke, heavy brine, spirity, sugary grain, buttered popcorn, spice. Noses like a tired cask, it's very spirity. But in a pleasant way. Water softens the edges, brings out more warmth and barley sweetness

**Taste:** Sugary grain, new make, lemon citrus, clean smoke, brine, light sweet custard, sharp spice. Bright and spirity, definitely a tired refill. But it isn't astringent or gross like that experience can often be. Spirity but pleasant. It warms up with some water, takes off the harsher edge and brings out more barley sugar and custardy sweetness. The smoke is surprisingly light, it's there but very clean and gentle

**Finish:** That clean streamlined smoke, brine, lemon, trails off with smoke and some darker char

**************

The extremely light color doesn't lie here, this tastes like a very tired refill cask. But it's not harsh or unpleasant. It's a really interesting glimpse into Talisker's base spirit which is pretty darn good. Sugary and citrusy, lots of brine, and a very clean smokiness. DavidOG from K&L always wants me to add water so I tried it out here, and actually it helps a lot on this one. Softens the edges and rounds it out really well without watering down the character. It's not a bottle I want but very fun and interesting to try

Nice review. I think I liked this one a bit more than you, and I really appreciate its purity of style every time I revisit it
I enjoyed this bottle more than most from the recent wave of youthful, single cask Taliskers.  While 11 years is considered ancient by some these days, the truth remains that this barrel is almost assuredly among the many that left Diageo‚Äôs hands just a few years after fill and have been slowly trickling out over the last 5-8 years.  

The first releases were as young as 5 and 7 years old.  It was quite apparent they needed more time in the wood (in fact, I used a few cases to fill a small cask of my own ).  Now that we‚Äôre in the double digits, we‚Äôre really seeing some splendid whisky in my opinion.  This eleven year is the first I‚Äôve tasted where I did not immediately detect that classic ‚Äúbaby vomit‚Äù  new make note.

It is clearly ‚Äúhot‚Äù with an ABV approaching 60, but it is exceedingly drinkable. More-ish even. That telltale Talisker note of freshly cut green apple / green pepper is front and center on full display, framed with a welcomed sweetness that really fills out this dram quite nicely. With every sip I found myself whispering ‚Äúah yes, Talisker‚Äù under my breath, as my mind confirmed what my taste buds were reporting.

The color, of course, is pale straw, reflecting Diageo‚Äôs overarching philosophy favoring ‚Äúspirit driven‚Äù whisky vs heavy cask influence.  That said, I‚Äôm sure if a bit of E150 found its way into this bottle (and people‚Äôs subconsciousness), few would complain about any lack of flavor.  This bottle, in my opinion, highlights what Talisker‚Äôs house style is about (albeit with a few exaggerations that serve the same purpose).  

All in all, I‚Äôm thankful I bought more than one bottle.
Great review.  As a huge Talisker fan I was kinda thankful that this bottle was CA only.  Then one of my friends was traveling there and... I ended up with a bottle.  IB Talisker isn't terribly common, and can often be quite divergent from the expected profile.  I decided to take a roll of the dice.

I'd describe it pretty similarly too.  Talisker out for a stroll in it's birthday suit.  The one bit of the distillery character I love that goes missing here is the black pepper.  Otherwise it's a slightly simple version of a classic.
Worm tub-condensed Scotch shine with less oak. Their distillery DNA tend to be really tasting. But aren't for people new to whisky.

Haha I love this, yes exactly. Very well put"

**Domaine du Cardinat 1984 35 year, 55%**

**Nose:** Dark and dank, tart berries, grape bubblegum, chocolate, dark sweet wood, vanilla, tobacco, minty spice, some balsamic but it doesn't overcome the big candy sweetness

**Taste:** Dark tannic wood, dark and burnt, lots of vanilla, sweetly toasted, drying rancio, brighter tart berry sweetness and spice builds, cocoa, burnt grape, toffee, mint, wood spice. Dark with burnt elements of dry tannic wood and rancio but it doesn't overcome the sweet candy fruits. This is so much fun it straddles both ends of darkness and fruitiness really well 

**Finish:** Drying dark toasted wood, vanilla, tannins, chocolate, rancio, grape bubblegum, smooth wood spice. Smooth and chocolatey with more of that yummy candy grape sweetness

*********************

I love Cardinat and this is a great one. It tastes as dark as it looks; there's burnt tannic wood and rancio but tons of sweetness too, sweet toasted wood, vanilla, tons of bubblegum and tart berry.

Thanks for the review! Did you see the recent Cardinat drop at kl? I really want to try Cardinat now thanks to your reviews but having a hard time deciding which to get‚Ä¶
The fact that you liked this so much after you liked the 2005 better than 1988 makes me more hopeful that I‚Äôll fall for the 1988 haha
Is it incredible you can get a 35 year old, 55% ABV brandy for $90?
Yep! I have the full lineup of all 5 bottles that K&L just got, I'll be reviewing them as soon as I get a chance
In the previous drop, 2005 was my favorite of the three vintages currently available. 1988 was really good too just drank very light even at 47%. Don't know how similar these new releases are to those though
Yeah I cant believe you didnt like this one more. It's so good. I still need to try the sample of 1981 I have and see how it compares
Is that still doable now?
Nice! On the last 'day drinking', David said his favorites are the '03,'90, and '84
Good to know thanks for the info!
I also ultimately wasn‚Äôt a fan of 1984. I enjoyed the intensity at first then struggled to get through the bottle. Comparing SBS with 81 didn‚Äôt help.
I don't think so.
Glances sideways at the Cardinat drop at K&L...
get all three. they‚Äôre the most affordable buy in Brandy‚Ä¶ for now"
"Review #728: Blackadder ""Chimera Cask Strength"" blended malt, 59%",,https://i.redd.it/7bgym3x8uua91.jpg,"A blend from the independent bottler Blackadder. There are a few releases of this at 46% and this cask strength one. According to u/unbreakablesausage ""made up of an Islay malt from a refill cask, a malt from a first-fill bourbon cask, a Highland malt from a sherry cask, and a Speyside from a sherry cask. What sizes are not specified. These are vatted together for additional aging, then bottled at cask strength with no age statement. 

Scotch review #292

********************************

**Blackadder ""Chimera"" blended malt, 59%**

**Nose:** Heavy peat, vanilla, charred and toasted wood, spice, Sweet jammy fruits, strawberry, black cherry, heavy vanilla, flinty and charred with lots of peat and sherry fruits. Love it so far

**Taste:** Toffee, heavy peat, tons of vanilla, strawberry jam, black cherry, charred and toasted wood, meaty and sulfury, spice. Lots of different stuff going on between the peat and sherry fruits but the flavors don't feel like they are competing at all. Feels right, flavor all lands perfectly. You taste the different elements really well

**Finish:** Vanilla, peat, sweet red fruits build brighter, soft spice, peaty vanilla, a very smooth fruity and peaty finish

*********************************

Tastes like a big sherried peat bomb and it's done really well. Even with all the big dramatic flavors it feels very well-balanced, has that even keeled character of a blended Scotch. Drinks amazingly smooth at 59% too. And you taste the different elements very clearly which is a lot of fun, the sherry and peat both come through cleanly and distinct. Appropriate since it is named after a monster from greek mythology that is made up of several different animals. I'd say this is a successful blend and makes me want to try more stuff like this from Blackadder

Sounds like it‚Äôs truly better than the sum of its parts. Exactly what a good blend can be!
Bet this isn't easy to find.
I mostly go for the Raw Cask line(which has featured some of the best well aged scotch I've ever had).  Maybe I should try their other products like this

"Review #727: Baraillon 1974, 45%",,https://i.redd.it/dqa257bv7ta91.jpg,"One of the bottles released in a big Baraillon drop from K&L, I believe it was in 2021. Went for something like $150-$200

Brandy review #127

***********************************

**Baraillon 1974 47 year, 45%**

**Nose:** Toffee, sweet fruits, bubblegum, grape, dark cherry, butterscotch, big smooth caramel, dank wet wood, vanilla, mint. Sweet and inviting with a hint of darker elements, smoothly balanced

**Taste:** Black cherry, black tea, Toffee, dark sweetly toasted wood, vanilla, char, mint, woody cherry, dry tannins and rich antique wood builds. Very complex on the palate but at the same time Baraillon has a way of coming together into this very cohesive mouthfeel. Complex wood, lots of caramel and sweetness with darker tannic notes creeping in

**Finish:** Sweet candy cherry, caramel, toasted wood, vanilla, fades into black tea, black cherry, dank tannic wood. Pleasantly sweet and woody finish

*****************

I have had quite a few Baraillons and I always find myself using phrases like ""smoothly balanced,"" ""rich,"" and ""cohesive."" Totally applies to this one as well. They feel expertly crafted and finished like a really good old OB Scotch might. This one is like candy on the nose, flavor has just the right amount of tannic wood creeping in. Lots of complex flavor under a smooth blanket of caramel and dank wood that all comes together effortlessly.

"Review #726: Ardbeg ""Fermutation"" committee release, 49.4%",,https://i.redd.it/lndva76dan991.jpg,"Interesting, I just tried a sample of this tonight as well and came to the opposite conclusion - yet another boring CR that's probably worse than the oogie/corry. I'd agree with the crisp clean take, but it's almost *too* clean, I found on the palate, the middle of the delivery almost disappeared. I also thought there was a bit of an off note marring the end of the palate into the finish. I had it at a 6/10 and would happily drink it if offered freely but wouldn't seek it out myself.
Back in 2007, there was an accident at the distillery involving a broken boiler. This resulted in a much longer fermenting time than usual, 3 weeks. It was aged for 13 years and bottled as a committee release. I think these go for about $200 msrp but are pretty hyped so can be found for much more

Scotch review #291

******************

**Ardbeg ""Fermutation"" committee release, 49.4%**

**Nose:** Intensely peaty, briny and boggy yet crisp and clean at the same time, barrel char, lots of tropical fruits, lemon, creamy and buttery, vanilla, sugary cake frosting, thick brine. It's so peaty and boggy yet so sweet and fruity and creamy even. What a delight

**Taste:** Huge boggy peat, brine, buttery and creamy, vanilla, sugary pastry, floral, happy tropical fruits, briny peat, char, bright lemon. Like the nose it has this really clean and crisp quality to it. Sweet and creamy with bright dessert notes and tropical fruits. Very much a peat monster still but not so down and dirty, it feels bright and happy. 

**Finish:** Crisp boggy peat and tons of brine builds big and stretches out, sweet buttery frosting, vanilla, tropical fruits, slowly descends into lingering briny peat and sweet barrel char 

**********************

Probably the best committee release I've had from Ardbeg. It's amazingly complex and isn't quite like any peat bomb I've had before. Intensely peaty and briny but it has this crisp clean feel, with tons of bright fruits and creamy sweetness. Hasn't detracted from the peat at all, there is just so much more going on. It dances across the palate. I would love to see Ardbeg and others experiment with longer fermentation times like this

Each to their own but I really thought this had all the aromatics of a stale wet towel.
First new Ardbeg I‚Äôve actually wanted to try for years, by the sound of it.
The best recent committee release in my opinion, an actual age statement and the gimmick with the ‚Äúbroken boiler‚Äù leading to longer and maybe even some spontaneous fermentation is actually interesting.
Got mine for MSRP, absolutely delicious
Ha that's usually my exact complaint about Ardbeg CR stuff too. They are overly light and boring, not really any better than oogie/corry. This one just really worked for me. Still not sure if I would have bought it for $200
I‚Äôm with you, I found this to be the most boring of the CRs and was missing a lot of personality in general.
Wow haha are you usually a fan of heavy peat?
Agreed, experimenting with fermentation is actually super interesting. Not just an easy gimmick of ""lets throw it in a weird cask for a few years and charge $200.""

I know other spirits like mezcal and calvados can have super long fermentation times and they get amazing results
I don‚Äôt know what it is either, but this one really worked for me as well. Tastes kind of like smoke that‚Äôs been through a car wash. Clean tasting, and very approachable. I wish so badly this wasn‚Äôt $200 dollars, if it were 60 I would buy it every time I saw it. I understand others thinking this wasn‚Äôt really for them though, especially if you love a smoke bomb or a fatty bacony taste. Cheers
Yes, my go to is Caol Isla, Laphroig, kilchoman. Anything islay to be fair. I enjoy ardbeg too, this was kitchen sink after you‚Äôve washed your dishes. It was interesting to try, i like new things, I will say that"
"Review #725: New Riff Malted Rye 6 year, 50%",,https://i.redd.it/p12pqvsw9m991.jpg,"Made from 100% malted rye which is very unusual for a Rye Whiskey. At 6 years it's the oldest New Riff Rye that I've seen. Not sure about MSRP on this, looking at prices I'm thinking somewhere in the $50-$75 range which isn't too bad.

American Whiskey review #273

*************************************

**New Riff Malted Rye 6 year, 50%**

**Nose:** Toffee, sweet toasted wood, vanilla, honey grahams, smooth clean rye grain, menthol, cherry, cereal malt, mellow rye spice. Elegant and well-rounded rye

**Taste:** Toffee candy, rich velvety caramel, sweet toasted wood, big clean rye grain, cherry, vanilla, cereal malt, soft herbal rye spice. Amazingly elegant and well-balanced. Bold clean rye flavor but it feels very polished, all the flavor flows smoothly. Rich oily mouthfeel. Just wow

**Finish:**Sweet toasted wood, cherry, toffee, brown sugar, smooth rye, lingering soft buzzy rye spice

**********************************

I am seriously impressed with this stuff. Not only is it delicious but I'm also getting a sense of where New Riff is going with their Rye profile. It's very unique. The malted rye gives it a smooth and elegant character while still maintaining that bold rye flavor. From New Riff: ""the typically spicy flavor of rye becomes polished, refined, and subtle."" And I definitely see that here. It's like a thick malty scotch approach to rye. I really didn't enjoy their standard 4 year BIB rye very much. It wasn't even that it was too youthful or hot, I just found it boring. With some age on it and more oak it's coming along beautifully here. I still love a fierce spicy rye slap to the face but this is great for something different.

I‚Äôm really liking what New Riff is doing. I‚Äôve enjoyed everything that I‚Äôve tried, really punching above their weight.
I was looking everywhere for this on some recent travels. Sounds great
New riff is going to win tons of awards in 4 years. Their 4 year offerings show so much potential that Barrel aging will smooth out.
The malted rye and winter whiskey are two of my favorite whiskeys I've ever had. Really good stuff.
I would really like to find this on a work trip some day.
In full agreement with you there, my favorite thing they have released so far.
Really enjoy the malted rye, I get a bunch of cocoa powder on the palate, it's such a different rye than the others out there.  I also enjoy the Balboa rye, two totally different profiles but both are excellent.  I'm not a fan of the New Riff bourbon options but their Rye offerings are on point
I really like their SiB Rye. What does malting the rye do to change the flavor profile?
They're getting more in this week from what I was told.
I really like the Balboa Rye too. That one is good as a more sharp and spicy herbal rye. But yeah objectively speaking this might be the best I've had from them
I talk about it in my review above. From New Riff:

>the typically spicy flavor of rye becomes polished, refined, and subtle

From what I tasted here, I would agree with that
I have both of these and the Balboa wins for me too!
Oh woops. That sounds great I‚Äôd love to come across a bottle."

**Nose:** Tropical fruit, cherry, caramel, brown sugary sweetness, smooth funk, spice, toasted wood, vanilla

**Taste:** Sweet fruits, cherry, sugary-sweet, soft spice, caramel, smooth toasted wood, vanilla

**Finish:** Sweet spice, tropical fruit, caramel, lingering wood and black cherry. Finish is good but a bit light

********************

Nose had me thinking rum, but then it got to tasting like it could be brandy too specifically armagnac. I'm trying to think if it could possibly be Scotch and I don't think it is unless it's an exceptionally fruity Scotch. I'm going with a very drinkable Armagnac. I think it's decent abv but still friendly, drinks like 45-50% but finish feels more like 45%. Decent age but not super old. No real specific guesses
But I do like it. Gonna say **7/10**

**Post-Reveal Thoughts:** It's such a big sweet fun fruitiness. It has some lingering dryness but the fruits hit bold like a softer Armagnac, so I can see why I went that way. I had a sneaking suspicion it was lower abv that just drinks a little bigger than it actually is. You can really tell on the finish where it isn't as big as it should be. Tasty and super drinkable like the 1974 that I love so much, it's fruitier and sweeter but thinner mouthfeel than that one.

Giboin is one of those producers I‚Äôd like to try more from. Astor had a single cask a while back that I really enjoyed, but I haven‚Äôt seen much more available in the States.
So tasty!  Love the fruitiness of their Borderies.  Only complaint is the low ABV, but they're fixing that problem with the upcoming releases and I am super excited.
The 1974 I have is soooo good. I've only had that and this one
I was not aware there were higher abv releases coming up? That sounds intriguing
They‚Äôve done some full strength stuff before, but it seems to be rare.

But I thought it would be fun to revisit it about 1.5 years later and alongside the 18

Brandy reviews #124 & 125

******************************************

**Adrien Camut 12 year Calvados, 41%**

**Nose:** Sweet juicy apple, brown sugar, caramel, an element of earthiness that gives it real weight and melds beautifully

**Taste:** Caramel, bright juicy apple you can almost chew on, brown sugar, earthiness, light brine, fruity and fun and sweet with a thick juicy mouthfeel

**Finish:** Sweet sugary apple, caramel, slightly tart, beautiful thick finish

* Such beautiful flavor and mouthfeel. It feels more bright and sweet next to the 18, but still has this earthy and caramel thickness to it that is amazing

****************************************

**Adrien Camut 18 year Calvados, 41%**

**Nose:** Juicy apple, a little darker, more measured and thick, toffee, brown sugar, boggy earthiness, toasted wood, soft tobacco, gentle spice

**Taste:** Epic flavor, it coats the mouth and flows beautifully. Thick luscious apple, toffee, slightly drying toasted wood, vanilla, juicy apple, a pop of brighter sugary apple sweetness. Oily and complex mouthfeel

**Finish:** Sweet thick apple, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, long lingering juicy apple and drying wood

* Incorporates some darker notes extremely well, apple is still bold but not as bright and sweet. Never feels totally woody or dark. Still lots of juiciness and sweetness that melds into balanced darker wood. Oily and complex mouthfeel

******************************************

No real favorite here, these are both amazing and each have their strengths. 12 year is bright and vibrant, the apple is so juicy you can almost chew on it. 18 year is more dry and woody, but not overly so at all. It has this oily and complex mouthfeel that is superb. Both have this incredibly dense and juicy apple flavor to it, and an earthy caramel quality that gives it some real body. Mouthfeel is amazing on both of these for being only 41% it always blows me away about Calvados. Camut is some of the finest Calvados that I've had. I had scored the 12 year an 8/10 before. And since then, if anything my opinion has only gone up as I try more calvados and see how special this domaine is. So I've got to say **9/10** for both of these

American Whiskey review #272

*********

**Elijah Craig Barrel Proof A122, 60.4%**

**Nose:** Toasted wood, big spice layer, musty, leather, vanilla, some butterscotch and sweet corn, cherry cola, thick HOT spice. Savory graham cracker with nice oak, big spice and sweetness. Mustiness intrudes just a little

**Taste:** Thick syrupy cherry and brash spice heat, funky corn, big toasted oak, stale wood, herbal notes, darker cola, vanilla. It's spicy and brash but has some thickness to back up the heat. It's not as oaky as other releases I've had and not as oaky as I would expect for being 12 years old. But it's a nice thick brash Bourbon assault

**Finish:** Sweet toasted oak, tobacco, cherry cola, thick herbal spice. It's a hot sweet finish with tons of thick spice

**********************

A big spicy and oaky bourbon. It's good, but I was hoping it would be a lot more oaky. My favorite releases like C919 and the older bottle styles were much darker and thicker than this. I've certainly had some great ones that were less oaky (like the fantastic r/Bourbon pick which was more creamy/butterscotchy), but this one falls short of those. There's also some mustiness and stale wood that intrudes a little. And a lot of heat. If you like a big spicy & oaky bourbon this is still great stuff for $70. But not one of my favorite releases. As an interesting sidenote I poured some of my beautiful oaky C919 next to this, and it is noticeably darker in color than the A122.

The A122 is way better than the B522. B520 is my favorite batch, have about quarter bottle left.
Have you tried jack daniels bottled and bonded? Worth a taste!
Great review. What did you rate the C921?
Just cracked this one open tonight, first ECBP I try, great stuff.
This is a limit of 1 per purchase at the Total Wine by me. Next step is the guarded cabinet.
Good juice.  I tend to like the lower proof releases of the ECBP.  I enjoyed that particular bottle.  I've got 3 or 4 other releases of ECBP I'm looking forward to getting into.
Just picked up a C920.   Anyone popped one and give me a heads up?   planning to open all my 12 year and do blind tasting one day...
What‚Äôs the monkey poster?
C919 is the best batch of the last few years by a wide margin in my opinion. I'm sad I drank the two I had in the midst of my almost year long pandemic bender. I could have been drinking swill and got the job done.
Man, we are getting spoiled if 120+ proof is too little.
I wish I had waited like you. There were so many rave reviews of this one and I had a chance to get it so I went for it. It's good but I could have gone without it.
Can i request wild turkey Kentucky spirit single barrel?
I'm skipping B522 because I've heard this from multiple sources. B520 was a true beauty. All the 2020's were great though, IMO FWIW cheers homie.
Just a silly poster that I really love and have had for a long time! I think it's originally an old ad for some liqueur or something
B520 would like a word
C921 is my favorite.
But that C918! C919 was good but 918 especially breathing time (still kept 1 open but killed other lol). It's straight brown sugar. Only recent batch I would put towards original releases but even then it's missing that richness and viscosity the old EC stuff had (all new releases are missing that). Like when we did prefire EC18 side by side current EC18, latter people loose their minds to pay for, they would spontaneously combust if they ever tasted prefire 18 lol, makes current 18 taste like sawdust with an extra side of tannin bitterness lol
Non-rhetorical question: How does someone both rate something as ""great"" and also say they could have gone without it?
I don't have any open right now, sorry! FWIW I love Wild Turkey, and I've enjoyed all the Kentucky Spirit I've tried

EDIT: [Looks like I've only reviewed one](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/c9lu78/review_91_wild_turkey_kentucky_spirit_10908/), and it's somewhat dusty from 2008
Some of the B releases are, mehhh at best. I don't know if it's the time of year with barreling (how the batches work) or what, but I did not like B522 and insure as hell didn't like B519. I kept B519 open this entire time and I sip once in awhile and put right back on the shelf, it's so fricken astringent and bitter  and somehow at that lower proof it's lava vs any of my 130+ proof stuff. Like even my gem C918 I have still is way more mellow on heat, and it's night and day better. 520 was better than 519 and 522, not on the level of C918 though that's like liquid brown sugar.
I've got one [bottle left](https://imgur.com/a/7wcVRoD) left. Definitely my second favorite recent batch.
That's a fair question. First off, scoring is hard. Sometimes there's a difference between the quality of something and my enjoyment level. This is a fine Bourbon, but it's not what I look for in these. I feel it's not as good as these can be, I've rated others an 8 or a 9. Another thing, it might sound jaded but I have a lot of very good bottles. My standard for something I want to own is a lot higher these days. That's just me though, which is why I still scored it high because I don't want to scare other people off by saying it's swill. TL;DR it's not so bad that I regret buying it but it's not up to my standard of something I want an entire bottle of.

But hey maybe it will grow on me it happens
Yeah, B521 is my least favorite of the batches I've tried. And I'm avoiding B522 now. So maybe there is something there.

But I think it could be a spurious correlation (due to random variance). I do love B520 - big fat caramel-stripe brownie notes for me. Can't remember what I thought of B519 though - I might have a little squirreled away in a sample bottle somewhere - should revisit it.
Certainly possible. We had two ECBP and two LBP last night and other than the A122, which was 1/3rd bottle and had been open three months, they changed quite a bit while drinking, even though we let them rest in glass for 25-30m each.

What recent bourbon (aka not C919) in a similar price range would you rather have bought?"

**Chateau du Breuil 15 year Calvados single cask no. 14001, 48.6%**

**Nose:** Bright bold apple, chocolate, caramel, toasted wood, vanilla, crisp pear, minty spice. Smooth understated oak notes with lots of bold apple

**Taste:** Toasted wood, vanilla, caramel, sugary fruits, smooth apple, spice, leather. There's some woody astringency at first but it calms down with air or I got used to it. Smooth oak notes that meld with the soft apple, adds caramel and vanilla and light chocolate with just a hint of tannins and strikes a nice balance. Doesn't feel especially oaky OR spirity

**Finish:** Dry mildly tannic wood, vanilla, caramel, smooth apple, spice, sweet fruits. A delicious finish, feels very measured and under control

*********************

It's tasty, even if it doesn't blow me away. Smooth wood influence that doesn't overpower the fruit, it strikes a nice balance. Breuil has this quality to me like the apple is being stretched a bit thin, feels almost astringent or thin sometimes. It's a minor thing though. The bold apple flavor all lands right where it needs to. And they aren't charging a premium for it, the prices are great on these and I think this is easily worth it. So far in my experience you really can't go wrong with any Calvados

**Taste:** Thick sugary barley, so smooth and malty, sweet pastry, vanilla pudding, white pepper, lemon, robust malt, butterscotch, brine. Sweet and malty, lots of barley, nice oily mouthfeel and a smooth friendly feel. It feels like a bigger version of the 43% 12 year, but not a lot bigger.

There is nothing not to like here if you like a malty bourbon barrel Scotch. It's on the lighter and sweeter side with tons of wonderful barley cereal notes. Not a bruiser of a Scotch at all, almost no heat. For fun I poured some of the (now discontinued) 12 year 43% alongside it. 12 year has richer barrel notes, richer caramel to it. This 13 year is more grain forward, it builds bigger and brighter with lots of barley and sugary dessert notes. All the richness comes from the robust cask strength malt. And it does it so smoothly. As a sidenote, the old 12 year 43% holds up really well. I'm still really sad those fuckers discontinued it.

A 55.2 OP single cask from K&L?  Yes please.
You‚Äôve piqued my interest enough to do some SBS w/ this bottling (which I find fantastic) and the 12/17/21 years I have somewhere on the shelves.
Sounds like a nice malt and not an assault on the palate. Nice review.

I agree that the old 43% version of Old Pulteney 12 as bottled for the American market was a banger of a bottle which holds up well (especially so considering its modest specs) against more prestigious bottles.

Cheers
Wonder how good this one is:

https://www.klwines.com/p/i?i=1610402
I remember a few years ago Pulteney was all the rage, now I rarely see people talking about it. Definitely a ton of wasted potential there. Bottlings like this one show what would be possible.
That old 17 year was so good, that would be an interesting one. Because the 12 holds up surprisingly well.
It used to be a great value, one of the better budget malty scotches out there. I used to be able to get the 12 year for $30-$40 and it was 43%. The price has gone up and they cut the abv to 40% so they kind of left Scotch fans behind.
Hey our product is getting more popular!  I know, lets make it worse!
So puzzling. While many brands have beefed up to 46% and NC/NCF, OP went the other direction and squandered their reputation in the enthusiast market. I wonder if their bottom line is better now, competing with blends and the most banal 40% offerings. To think that not that long ago the 17 and 21 were highly celebrated by the cognoscenti.
You have a future at Whyte & Mackay product strategy"

World Whisky review#26

************

**Alberta Premium Cask Strength Rye, 66%**

**Nose:** Butterscotch, toffee, tons of cinnamon, rye spice, green apple, cherry. It's a blast of big, bright, action-packed rye that cuts right through

**Taste:** Big blast of bright rye zingy spice, candy cherry, rye grain, green apple, butterscotch, muted toffee, tons of hot cinnamon. Grain forward, action-packed, bright. It's a huge blast of Rye that explodes on the palate. I could see it leaning too hot and spirity for some but as a huge Rye fiend I'm really digging it.

**Finish:** Butterscotch, mint, big clean rye, cinnamon spice. Lingering hot cinnamon spice and big clean rye flavor. No real surprises on the finish, just more bright hot Rye assault

*********************

I've heard mixed things about this which is why I never jumped on a bottle. I can see it not appealing to fans of strong 95-100% rye, but as a total rye fiend I'm really digging it. Maybe not great as a contemplative or rich, well-structured sipper. But it's a total celebration of rye excess. If you aren't that into rye it could feel too hot and spirity I think. And it almost is. But in my opinion, there's enough butterscotch and fruits to keep it from being a mess. And as hot as it is, I don't think its bad for being 66%. I've had ryes in the 50-60% that feel much hotter and more messy than this. Hard to score because of personal bias and it feels kind of niche. Something that I would have to be in the mood for but perfect for that rye insanity mood

I loved this. Everyone i‚Äôve recommended it to who‚Äôs had it said it was way too hot. Maybe I just got a really great bottle - I get caramel sticky buns all day, and bought 3 more bottles immediately. If this is a 7 what‚Äôs your 8 and 9?
I was torn with this release... I definitely felt it was pretty hot but overall had a tasty profile... I enjoyed it more in a Boulevardier but not so  much neat.... Personally I'd pay a $25 premium and get a WhistlePig Single Barrel Pick from Alberta Distillery everytime... They are far more complex and have a much denser profile.
Is this the jim Lahey whiskey?!
Is this the newest batch?
I tried this once, don‚Äôt know what batch and it was rough. I‚Äôm no stranger to high proof pours. Stagg jr would be my deserted island bottle.

But a sip of this and my chest seized up and I couldn‚Äôt breathe for several seconds. There‚Äôs Kentucky hugs and then there‚Äôs what I experienced.
Just opened my bottle of this and searched for notes. I agree this is a purist rye. Straightforward nothing super complex. Creamy af. Doesn‚Äôt drink 66pct at all. Although a drop or two of water brings out very nice vanilla notes
I love this stuff, and agree with your notes. Not complex at all, but tasty.
I'm a big fan. I have bottles from the last three years still, albeit just a little left of each right now. Been meaning to compare them. The ABB on each release is slightly different.
I agree with your sentiment. And scoring is hard. I almost gave this an 8 and kind of wish I had, but it was a sample so I can't revisit it to see if I want to change my mind on the score. 

Honestly a 10 is super rare, a 9 is basically a perfect score for me with 10 being reserved for hypothetical earth-shattering stuff. I've only ever given out a few
Close, same distillery. Pretty sure he would have went for three bottles of the 40% version for the same amount of money, though.
No, I think it's a little older
You're right, and I forgot to put that in my review. It looks like there are different batches of this stuff with different abv's. I'm curious how much they vary
I definitely agree with a 7 rating. If the younger components were aged longer and it was a bit less hot, I think this would have done a lot better. But I enjoyed the grain forwardness of it and thought it had a pretty good length finish.
Oh yeah, 66.0 is batch 2 - had to go check my collection, lol.
I tried batch 1 at 65.1% and batch 2 at 66% side by side and they‚Äôre pretty similar. Not sure I could tell them apart blind."

This bottler is called Thompson Brothers, but for legal reasons I don't fully understand they can't use that name in the U.S. so they go by Redacted Brothers here. Secondly, the distillery cannot officially be named but these bottlings are generally considered to be Laphroaig. To me the notes are in line with that. This was one of three K&L exclusives released recently, got it for $300.

Scotch review #289

***********************

**""Thompson/Redacted Brothers Isle Islay"" (Laphroaig) 1989 31 year, refill hogshead 51.6%**

**Nose:** Thick clean medicinal peat, brine, heavy vanilla, lemon, soft pepper, custard, light fruits, bready malt, sweet barrel char. Age has not tamed the peat here at all. Classic briny and medicinal Bourbon barrel Laphroaig, nose hits big yet silky smooth at the same time

**Taste:** Clean bready malt, brine, medicinal peat builds huge yet soft, vanilla, sweet custard, warming lemon, white fruits, barrel char. Still obvious that age has not tamed the peat at all here. Strong medicinal peat and the flavor all flows softly, coats the mouth with peaty and malty goodness without feeling like an assault. Classic Laphroaig peat monster but smoothed out and softened  

**Finish:** Huge medicinal peat, pop of brighter lemon, pepper, custard, bready malt, gritty brine and sweet charred peat on the tail end. Lingering sweet Frog peat with a soft brininess. Stays soft and balanced all the way through, with just enough bold char and peat to keep it interesting and delicious

************************

This is an excellent Laphroaig. It's one of my favorite distilleries, I'm particularly fond of it in a Bourbon barrel and this has everything I love about them. The age hasn't lessened the peat at all, just softened and balanced it all out. The whole thing feels very soft and elegant despite the strong Islay peat. It basically drinks like the smoothest Cask Strength 10 you will ever have. 

But that is kind of the problem too. Considering the age and price, I feel entitled to nitpick a little, and I was hoping for a little bit more of a unique experience. I wish it showed it's age a little better, been maybe a little more delicate and complex overall. This shows some pretty strong barrel notes, and I was hoping for more of the tropical fruits that Laphroaig can show with a lighter wood influence. It's hard to complain too much though, because it's delicious. It does the Bourbon barrel Laphroaig profile very well which I'm a big fan of, and does it very smooth and elegant at it's age. Maybe just a little *too* standard of a Laphroaig experience

Something I just noticed about the label art. It's the hatchway lid of a still, and looking at some pics it seems to be a Laphroaig still. See the pic on this page http://www.laphroaig.it/en/news/news_17.html

Maybe they are giving a little clue to it being Laphroaig?
While I've only had a tiny dram from my bottle I strongly agree with your overall assessment and a lot of your tasting notes. It's dead-on profile for Laphroaig, which is of course the reason I bought the bottle in the first place. But it also doesn't veer into any unexpected directions, it simply tastes like beautifully aged Laphroaig. So like you said, while it's hard to call that a fault, I kind of wish there was that element of surprise that you secretly hope for when you get an expensive bottle.

Either way though I can't wait to savor this one and see what time and air do for the whisky, it's such a great one even if it's fairly straight-laced.

As an aside, also, this is probably the best color matching between the bottle and your background poster yet.
I think they sell under Thompson Bros here, but when a brand asks them to not use their distillery name on their bottles, they label them ‚Äúredacted bros‚Äù as a tongue in cheek call out of the brands who do that. K&L talked about this a little recently.
Thanks for the review. When I talked to David O-G at K&L a while back the 1991 is the one he recommended. Based on a side-by-side of all three on here it sounds like the 1990 is very good as well. 1989 doesn't seem to have the wow factor.
Yes, very well put. And I had not been paying attention to color matches with the poster haha
But K&L has other bottlings with the distillery name on it, like the Teaninich and Caol Ila, that still say Redacted Brothers. I thought I heard it was some legal thing here, they got sued or a cease & desist or something
Maybe I misunderstood what their whisky buyer was saying then. Totally possible that‚Äôs it‚Äôs that. I do know they had these listed under Laphroaig before pulling them down, so someone at Beam-Suntory def. reached out lol.
There is a Bourbon brand in the USA called Old Thompson.
Yep, I remember that too when they were listed as Laphroaig haha. That's when you could get this one for $300, it went up to $350 once they came back in stock with the Laphroaig name removed
Yeah, I‚Äôve had them in my cart like six different times and just never pulled the trigger for some reason. Glad to see reviews starting to come in though."

I seemed to get much more fruitiness this time around. Thought it was funny that I said here it almost noses like a brandy, and in my original I have ""fruity grape"" as a note. Interesting to see the similarities and differences of the same thing on different occasions. I think side-by-sides can also amplify certain notes sometimes when focusing on differences between two whiskies

American Whiskey reviews #270 & 271

**********************************

**Jim Beam ""Ducks Unlimited"" decanter 1987 100 month, 40%**

**Nose:** Quite fruity, candy cherry, caramel, smooth toasted oak, vanilla, toasted marshmallow. It really has an almost tropical fruitiness to it that is delicious

**Taste:** Sweet zingy corn, candy cherry, caramel, silky smooth with a nice oily mouthfeel, some musty toasted wood, light spice. At 40% it is very simplistic, not terribly complex or bold but maintains really nice flavor with a nice oily mouthfeel. Maybe just a bit washed out

**Finish:** A sweet and easy finish, caramel, corn, sweet toasted wood with light zingy spice

********************

**Jim Beam Black 1982 101 months, 44%**

**Nose:** Darker toasted oak, light smooth tobacco, minty spice, vanilla, caramel, corn, barrel char. Light and agreeable in it's dark way

**Taste:** Toffee, brown sugar, anise, zingy corn, cherry, toasted wood, wood spice, light vanilla and char. Has a smooth and flowing mouthfeel, very nice flavor with an interesting complexity to it.

**Finish:** Wood spice and caramel, light tannins, toasted wood, anise, vanilla

**************************************

First off I have to say these both drink great for the low abv compared to modern stuff. They aren't blowing me away or drinking way higher than their proof necessarily, but they have this really smooth and inviting flavor with a nice mouthfeel. Way better than any modern 45% stuff. These were meant to be sipped and enjoyed smoooothly and it does that very well. 

They are a lot of fun to do sbs because they are so very different. 1987 was very fruity, sweet, and vibrant. 1982 had more darker oak notes and spice, was just a tad punchier at the higher abv. In the end, the 1987 wins for me. Despite being significantly lower abv, it actually had the thicker and more oily mouthfeel of the two. And the vibrant fruity flavor just really comes alive. I swear the nose could almost be a brandy. 1982 was still really good stuff, it had a light punchiness and complexity that was impressive for a 44% Bourbon. Both are quality dusties.

If you can spare 10-15 mL of each I‚Äôd be really curious what they‚Äôd be like blended together. From your description it sounds like the fruit and oak might balance each other nicely.
1987 with a tax strip or a faux strip?
Oooh that's a good idea. unfortunately the 1982 was just a sample and I don't have any left
It did have a tax strip that I broke when opening it, not sure how to tell if it's faux or not
It should say ""Bureau of ATF""  on the right hand side if it is from 1987. If its legit.
The strip is gone from the cap, and the bit that is still stuck on the decanter doesn't have anything written on it. It might have only served as a tamper seal since you can't get shrinkwrap on it due to the decanter shape
Then that's a faux strip which makes perfect sense for 1987 asby then most werent using them."

**Nose:** Sharp clean Rye, dill, toffee, mint, spice, coffee, toasted oak, vanilla, green dark cherry, vanilla. Beautiful nose of clean Rye and sweet dark oak notes

**Taste:** Green minty rye that is sharp and clean, sweet toasted oak, toffee, cherry cola, vanilla, hefty spice kick but doesn't overpower the flavor. Lots of big clean rye flavor, fruitiness and sweet oak, all very well-balanced. Has a streamlined minty and oaky feel that I love

**Finish:** Gets hotter on the finish with big bright rye spice, cinnamon, sharp clean mint, hot cherry, caramel and sweet toasted oak. Lingering sweet minty rye

************************

Full disclosure I am a huge fan of MGP 95/5 Rye so I am very biased. But even with my ridiculously high standards for these I think this is a great one. I was a huge fan of the Willett MGP single barrel picks back in the day, and this comes close to that profile even if it isn't quite up to the quality of those. Big clean rye notes, nice fruitiness and dark sweet oak, all very cohesive. I love the big bold rye flavor of MGP 95/5 and this is a classic example of what makes them great

**Bulleit Single Barrel Lincoln Road IV, 52%**

**Taste:** Bold sweet corn, smooth toasted oak, just a hint of smooth cigar tannins, caramel, orange, mint, maple, cinnamon spice, vanilla. Nice smooth oak notes, light tannins, some sweetness and spice but nothing takes over too much. Straightforward and very well-balanced, and super drinkable at 52%

*************************

A really nice Bourbon and super drinkable at 52%. I believe this is around the 10 year mark, and it has a little bit of an older edge to it with big vanilla and light tannins, but all with a very smooth presentation. This is my first time trying one of these Bulleit Single Barrels. Totally worth the low price they go for and thoroughly enjoyable. A nice middle ground between barrel proof flavor and lower-abv smoothness. I know people get excited about Bottled in Bond stuff but this blows away most young hot 50% BIB I've had

Lincoln Road means the package store? I‚Äôd trust Jaime Farris to be an automatic 7+ score on a pick.
I‚Äôve never been a huge fan of most Bulleit release I‚Äôve tried, but the single barrel I got about a year ago was really, really good.
I love this bottle so much. Always buy more when I run out!
This isn't the same Lincoln Road in Hattiesburg, is it?..

Edit: Another comment below seems to indicate it is.  Just went for the first time last weekend during Game 1 of USM-Ole Miss (Go Rebs!).  Snagged their Barrel Pick 1792 Full Proof and Bib & Tucker 12yr. while I was there.  Really good selection and something I can see myself frequenting in the future (coast resident here).
Yeah, that's the only Lincoln Road I know of. They do a lot of picks and have a reputation for quality
They had some Ardbegs I had never seen before.  And more Nulu's than I even knew existed (not a huge fan of Nulu in spite of all the hype currently).  I'll definitely be back!"

Scotch review #288

******************

**Ledaig 2008 11 year Archives, hogshead 53.8%**

**Nose:**Intense yet super-clean peat, tons of sharp brine, honey, biscuity and bready, mean barrel char, petrol, vanilla, menthol. This is peat heaven so far

**Taste:** Intense charred peat, tons of brine, it pummels you but somehow feels very sleek and clean at the same time, sugary icing, bready malt, honey, clean smoke, vanilla, barrel char. Peat and brine and clean sugary malt coats the mouth, it's huge but with a perfect clean mouthfeel. It's like a streamlined peat delivery system

**Finish:**  Sweet sugary icing, huge clean peat, vanilla, brine, it goes on forever and starts to descent into a more gritty charred vanilla, menthol and dirty peat. Incredible finish 

***************

What a Scotch. That finish is amazing. It's all pretty amazing, but obviously the finish is what really sticks with you(by definition). Almost like the finish never really ends. There's this sweet vanilla peatiness that lingers long after you've taken your last sip. This might be the most intense and briny peat you can get outside of Islay. 

And honestly, unlike stuff such as Talisker or Ardmore this could pass for Islay blind. Got me wondering about the differences so I poured a similar Caol Ila next to it. A G&M Caol Ila 11 year Bourbon barrel 54.1%. Caol Ila is pretty briny too, but it's more integrated and soft. The brine on the Ledaig just pops. Caol Ila is softer overall, it's more of a lumbering sludgy peat. Ledaig feels clean and nimble even though the peat is every bit as intense. I really love Caol Ila, but it's more like an ""old reliable"" peat bomb. This Ledaig is much sexier.

Thanks for the review. I‚Äôve been wondering should I pick up a bottle of this? Freck yes!
I wish I could find this bottle in US
Got a bottle, $80 on close out - it is amazing. Opened it camping and it was hard to separate this from the wood smoke. Great stuff!
Ledaig is always so good. And damn I thought this was gone but looks like there are some left at some stores right on
Its exclusive to Binny's, a store in Chicago
Yup, 5 just 2 miles away. I have a meeting tomorrow and will be going right by that Binnys. I‚Äôll pickup a bottle. Thanks for the review and looking forward to trying this one.

Brandy review #122

*******************

**Darroze ""Chateau de Lahitte"" 1981 40 year, 46%**

**Nose:** Toffee, smooth wood, cinnamon, floral perfume, twangy grape, light root beer, menthol spice. Very complex with some odd perfumy and twangy notes but it works

**Taste:** Cherry cough syrup, caramel, perfumy floral notes that build and takes over a little too much, sandalwood, bitter oak, cinnamon spice. That big perfumy/floral thing is not working for me, it takes over and feels hot with the spice. Not as woody or as balanced as I would hope for the age

**Finish:** Numbing spice and big floral perfume, harsh sweet cherry, leaves sweet and spicy

*****************

This is not very pleasant. The big perfume is just way too intrusive and the wood is unpleasant and there's not enough fruits or wood richness to balance any of it out. For being 40 years old it's not very woody at all actually. Luckily, even at 46% it feels weak which is probably doing it a favor. If the abv was any higher it would probably be a lot worse. Glad I split this one with a friend and didn't buy a whole bottle. But at least the nose is nice!

**Darroze ""Domaine de Salie"" 1996 25 year, 49%**

**Nose:** Light sweetly toasted wood, honey, sticky-sweet caramel, floral, sweet fruity grape, candy cherry, buzzing spice. 

**Taste:** Honey, caramel, lightly toasted wood, slightly drying oak, building peppery spice but not too hot, floral notes, candy cherry. It's on the lighter side but it does it very well. Stays pleasant and balanced, but maybe just a tad too thin 

**Finish:** Builds to a bit more challenging finish of floral notes, wood spice, drying oak, sweetens with light caramel and cherry, lingering smooth tannic oak. A light yet complex finish

***************

A lighter style of Armagnac which can sometimes feel young but this one does it well. You aren't being pummeled with oak and fruits, more honey and floral notes come out with a just hint of tannins and dry oak to give it some of that well-aged feel. It comes across just a little thin sometimes but it's a minor complaint. Darroze seems to like this style of Armagnac with lighter oak and more floral notes, and this one is nice even if it isn't my preferred style.

Brandy reviews #119 & 120

********************

**Yvan Auban Bas-Armagnac 1985 29 year, 43%**

**Nose:** Dark blackened wood, grape, balsamic, cherry, caramel, mint, spice. Dark and sweet, really enjoy this kind of nose

**Taste:** Dark sweetly charred wood, vanilla, grape, drying rancio, mint, spice, cherry. Darkly sweet, the dry rancio stays balanced and adds layers of complexity. Big flavor at 43%

**Finish:** Vanilla, sweet cherry, dark dry tannins, caramel, smooth darkly toasted wood, grape. More sweet fruits on the finish very nice

* Just the right balance of dark charred tannic notes and sweetness from both the wood and the fruits, really great stuff. Great mouthfeel and big flavor at what I assume is natural 43% strength

**8/10**


***************************************

**Yvan Auban Bas-Armagnac 1979 35 year, 43%**

**Nose:** Rich caramel, grape, chocolate cherry, dark toasted wood, vanilla, toasted marshmallow, cutting minty spice. Not as dark as 1985, less rancio, more fruits and caramel and vanilla

**Taste:** Thick caramel, dark toasted wood, big vanilla, warm fruity grape, soft mint, chocolate, balanced gritty tannic oak. Similar darkly sweet profile to the 1985 but less rancio, more caramel and vanilla. Just as delicious in it's own way

**Finish:** Caramel, grape, vanilla, smooth dark toasted wood, light drying tannins

* You can feel that similar darkly sweet profile like the 1985, but it's less rancio, more caramel and vanilla. More accessible overall. Mostly a good mouthfeel like the 1985 too but it starts to thin out just a little on the finish.

**7/10**

************************************

These are both great. An excellent example of a dark sweet profile which I love, and it's done very well. They both have their own unique personalities but they stay well-balanced without any one note taking over too much. And also an excellent example of Armagnac doing great at a naturally low abv, great mouthfeel with flowing flavor. 1985 is the winner of the two. Bigger flavor, more complex, and slightly better mouthfeel. 1979 is still a great one though. I will take notice if I ever see this domaine somewhere.

Thanks for the review
Yvan is a distiller / negociant. You may have seen his name on some L‚ÄôEncantada offering.
I dont think I have seen encantada like that, but that's interesting. So would this stuff be their own armagnac or could it possibly be something they bottled from someone else?
Beastmasters 1992 Lassalle was distilled by Yvan for example. This would most likely be Armagnac they distilled themselves - but not their own grapes."

Scotch review #287

*************************

**Dailuaine 1997 21 year Signatory Unchillfiltered #7251, 46%**

**Nose:** Classic malty Dailuaine. Thick waxy malt, barley, warm buttery biscuit, pepper, soft green apple, vanilla, sweet tropical fruits. So malty and thick and inviting

**Taste:** Everything falls into place exactly where you hoped it would based on the nose. Smooth and malty, robust barley cereal, velvety mouthfeel, pepper, light sweet tropical fruits, a brighter touch of sugary icing and barley, vanilla. Goes down so easy at 46%, a nice mouthfeel with smoothly balanced flavor. It just feels so right

**Finish:** Clean sweet barley, some gritty toffee char, sugary sweetness, vanilla, lingering sweet barley

************************

I fall in love with Dailuaine every time I drink it, and this one is no exception. I don't think I've had a bad one yet. It's so incredibly consistent and it always makes for a great waxy malt bomb. This one is so easy-drinking at 46%. It has just the right balance of sugary-sweetness, robust malt, and fruits and it all just glides across the tongue effortlessly. It's complex but makes it look easy. Actually, it's kind of hard to believe it's a single cask, it just feels so well-crafted. A great malt-bomb and a delight to drink

Where does everyone get these little bottles of rare scotch?
Oh hey! I recognize that cask number, I reviewed the same one a few years back. It's delicious. I agree with your notes, also remember a lot of melon and complex floral things going on, and also that the palate somehow delivered *more* than the nose promised. 

This bottle was... wait for it... $65 when released in 2019. What a steal.
Succinct and well-written review, as usual. Makes me wonder whether I should have grabbed the 11yr Battlehill Dailuaine I saw at our Total Wine today. I stood in front of it deliberating whether I should grab it. I eventually came home with the Redemption 10yr BP Rye I went for. A return trip may be warranted after reading this review.
Hey, glad you liked it and really nice review. It's a stellar Speyside.  As u/dustbunna mentioned, $65 back in 2019. I think it's the best Dailuaine I've had to date. 

Here's a plug for the guy who selected the cask. His name is Dennis and he used to work for Vine and Table in Indianapolis. He has his own shop ""Storied Company"", every bottle has a story, in downtown Indianapolis. A wonderful and quirky shop. It's technically a bar that sells bottles. You can sample just about anything they have. He travels to Scotland and Ireland to hand select casks and he has selected some really nice ones.

Anyway, glad you liked it.
Some of us just share stuff among friends, and these 2oz boston rounds are the preferred method.
Daaaamn that's crazy. That was a pretty killer price for something like this even back then. Dailuaine gets that no-name distillery discount which is fine by me
Thanks for reading! That's a tough call. Battle Hill aren't always a safe bet, but I haven't had a bad Dailuiane so might be worth the risk if the price is right. Anyway that Redemption BP Rye 10 year is fantastic so you did ok
It really is a special one. And damn that's quite an interesting story behind it too, love to see what else he's picked after trying this
That‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôm a year into this scotch/whiskey thing so I‚Äôm still figuring things out.
Agreed, a magical bottle. I‚Äôve had a handful of Dailuaine‚Äôs, all good but this one was special. Another amazing signatory bottling he picked was a 20 yo Imperial bottling, 50.2%. I ended up buying 4, 2 for gifts, 2 for me."

Rum review #9

*****************

**Le Galion Grand Ar√¥me, Martinique Rhum 58.32%**

**Nose:** Big zingy tropical fruit, sugary-sweet, pineapple, spice, chalky sweetness, black licorice, burnt rubber, cutting menthol, green apple. Insanely complex. Bold and sharp and cutting 

**Taste:** Bright pop of tropical fruit, a burnt rubber and chalky-sweet funk that is a little weird at first but does give it some character, black licorice, big spice blast, gritty menthol, chalky sweetness, so much bold zingy fruits. The flavor and mouthfeel is just huge. Insanely complex in a loud way. Clear rum like this is so damn fun, such a crazy symphony of raw flavor

**Finish:** Biiiiig finish, explodes with bold zany tropical fruits, green apple, pineapple, strong black licorice, metallic, the complexity and action slowly mellows into this warm tropical fruit embrace with a trace of the burnt black licorice funk

*************

God I love clear rum. Huge wild flavor, feels so raw but without being a hot mess at all. It's some of the best fun you can have with spirits. This stuff has a weird kind of burnt rubber or black licorice funk to it, it always puts me off a little but tonight I've acclimated and I think it gives it some nice funky character. Not quite DOK levels of greatness but it's tons of fun

Score: **7/10**
Great review! Currently have my bottle in route from FineDrams. Like you, I love a wild clear rum. Pumped for this one
Nice review. Still need to open mine. This is good motivation.
Finally got my Fine Drams order yesterday and dived right into this one last night. 

Holy funky town! This one was fun. The nose felt familiar to Jamaican rums I‚Äôve had. But the taste went from overripe fruit to tangy yogurt to straight licorice. I think I still taste the tangy yogurt this morning. Can‚Äôt wait to try this one more.
How does this compare to the Savanna HERR in terms of flavor?
I've only tried HERR once and it was quite a while ago, can't remember specifics but I did like HERR more. This one has that odd burnt black licorice funk to it that isn't quite like any other clear rum I've had."

American Whiskey review #267

****************

**Bone Snapper Rye (Dickel) 7.5 year r/Bourbon pick, 60.5%**

**Nose:** Graham cracker, brown sugar, numbing menthol and anise, friendly herbal spice, woody cherry, green minty rye, toasted wood, vanilla. Nice tasty rye nose, balanced and inviting

**Taste:** Sweet charred wood, anise, hot cinnamon, charred minty rye, syrupy cherry, brown sugar, toffee, herbal rye spice. Really nice hot sweet rye, but even at 60% it's not an assault. Water makes it even better. Calms down the spice and brings out tons of sweetness, candy cherry, brown sugar, clean herbal rye, doesn't feel too watered down or boring

**Finish:** Cinnamon spice, herbal rye, dark woody cherry, lingering cherry and hot spice. Lots of strong rye character, nice but just a little short and lacking

******************

I'm not usually big on adding water but it makes a big difference with this one. On it's own it is very good but just a bit hot and closed. A touch of water calms down the heat and brings out a lot of sweetness, and without dulling it. It's a nice balance of wood notes, sweetness and big rye flavor. Really good stuff. I'm a big fan of strong 95-100% mashbill rye and I often find Kentucky rye lacking. But this stuff makes the cut I like it.

EDIT: I just found out that Dickel might actually use a 95% mashbill themselves, just like MGP. That would explain why I like this stuff so much compared to kentucky Rye

I don't think Dickel distills rye. On there own website they say they get it from MGP in Lawrenceburg, IN. Bone Snapper is pretty well know as an MGP sourced brand as well. Do you think they may have bought MGP barrels from Dickel?
Nice run down, I've enjoyed the Bone Snapper pours that I have tried.
A lot of the Tennessee distilled rye these days is coming from cleverly-named ‚ÄúTennessee distilling Ltd‚Äù including Riverset I believe
You are correct that the standard cheap Dickel Rye bottle is sourced from MGP. But from what I understand this is distilled in Tennessee at Cascade Hollow, same place as Dickel. Just like [this single barrel Tennessee Rye](https://www.klwines.com/p/i?i=1585154) at K&L. I don't think Dickel has an official release of their own for this rye, just these odd single barrels.
This was Dickel.
Riverset ryes are actually dickel rye. Dickel x Leopold brothers 3 chamber rye also uses the dickel rye in the blend.
Thanks for the reference to the K&L pick. I really dig the r/bourbon Bone Snapper rye pick and I figured I'd take a chance on the K&L bottle.  Only bummer is that K&L will only ship to CA.  Once I crack it, I may have to post a review.
Is that who they sourced it from? That always threw me for a loop because Riverset is a 95/5 which is MGP's darn near signature haha, but Riverset says distilled in TN."

Brandy reviews #116-118

***********************

**Chateau de la Grangerie ""La hauresse"" 1975 45 year, 43%**

**Nose:** Grape, toasted cherry wood, rich vanilla, red fruits, mint, mild tannins

**Taste:** Quite tannic and dry. There's some really nice flavor, sweet toasted wood, caramel, cherry soda, vanilla, grape. Then big dry woody tannins take over, leather, wood spice. The dry tannic oak is nice if you're into that kind of thing but I think it takes over just a bit too much

**Finish:** The dry tannins build, very dry, wood spice, tobacco, some cherry and vanilla

* Nose is wonderful but then the flavor is too dry. On my first tasting it was an overload of dry tannins, but between tastings either I acclimated or the air helped because it was nicer the second time around. Still very dry and woody but it felt a little more balanced.

**6/10**

***************************

**Chateau de la Grangerie ""La hauresse"" 1970 50 year, 43%**

**Nose:** Toasted cherry wood, caramel, chocolate grape, thick vanilla, smooth tannins, graham cracker, gentle wood spice

**Taste:** Caramel, rich warm grape, vanilla, toasted cherry wood, smooth drying tannins, some gritty wood spice. Delicious, great mouthfeel and flavor flows beautifully at 43%

**Finish:** Smooth tannins, cherried wood spice, caramel, vanilla grape, light soy sauce. It's a nice complexity of dry oak and warmer toasted/fruit notes

* Oh yeah this is really nice after the 75. Has some dry oak quality but it's extremely well-balanced, adds complexity to the delicious vanillas, caramel and chocolate grape instead of just taking over. Great mouthfeel at 43%

**7/10**

*****************************

**Chateau de la Grangerie ""La hauresse"" 1964 57 year, 43%**

**Nose:** Sweet toasted wood, tons of vanilla, caramel, wood spice, sweet candy cherry, minty char, some smooth mild tannins. Sweet and inviting nose

**Taste:** Cherry cola, soy sauce, caramel, big sweet toasted wood, vanilla, graham cracker, smooth drying tannins, wood spice. Very complex range of flavors that all meld together 

**Finish:** Big sweet candy cherry and grape, vanilla, caramel, sweet toasted wood, trails off with some smooth tannins and light soy sauce. Sweet with dark wood it's delicious

* The sweetest of the three. The oak has almost gone backwards from what you would expect: The 75 being overly tannic, 70 being more well-balanced, and 64 being the most fruity and sweet. But there's still tons of rich toasted Armagnac wood and vanilla here. The 75 had me worried these would be duds, but luckily it's the outlier. 1970 and 1964 are killer and this one is my favorite

Nice reviews!  Those are some old brandies.
I am trying to find cask strength brandy to no avail? Where, may I ask, were you able to purchase this and others like it?
Wow I am really surprised to see scores for such old bottles only at 6-7.5/10. I see in your scale those are still good scores though.
A lot of these brandies I review are from K&L in California. They get tons of great stuff but don't ship out of state. You might have to do some hunting, there's stuff here and there. Finedrams has tons of good stuff and they ship pretty much anywhere. Cognac-Expert is another good one. Astor wine in New York gets good stuff and will ship to certain states."

Scotch review #286

*****************

**Mortlach 2008 10 year Signatory Binny's pick, Bourbon barrel 56.3% (done blind)**

**Nose:** Honey, green apple, bright fruits, sweet pastry, barely, floral and sweet. Think it's Scotch, very speyside-y sweet and fruity

**Taste:** Pop of bright sugary barley and green apple, cake frosting, honey, sweet fruitiness, cask strength kick of spice. No surprises after the nose. I still think it's sweet barley-forward Scotch, leans on the bright and fruity side with a light cask influence

**Finish:** Sweet tropical fruits, lots of sugary-sweet barley, decent amount of spice heat, lingering honey spice and barley

*******************

This tastes very much like a speyside Scotch, the kind of profile that could be a hundred different things. But done very well. It has a nice bright fruitiness and sweetness to it that is well-executed, so I want to say it's one of the big boys like Glenfiddich or Balvenie. Tastes like a respectable 55% although it has a healthy spice kick that might put it a bit higher. Well-balanced, doesn't taste super young or exceptionally old so maybe 12-15 years? These feel like such vague guesses haha. Also in case it wasn't evident I'm guessing this is Bourbon barrel, possibly refill. Doesn't taste very sherried to me

Score: **8**

**Post-reveal thoughts:** It's mortlach! This is the best Bourbon barrel mortlach I've had. It doesn't have that ""meaty"" and ""beefy"" quality you always here about Mortlach having at all to me. I don't have a ton of experience with the distillery honestly. As I sip on my last bit, I can maybe pick up some of that meatiness but it mostly just feels bright and sweet and fruity. Anyways I really enjoy it. All the Binny's Scotch picks I've had have been great

American Whiskey review #266

*********************

**Wild Turkey ""Donut,"" Kentucky Legend Single Barrel 57.3%**

**Nose:** Dank wood, tons of vanilla, smoothly tannic, sweetly toasted and charred, tobacco, black cherry, chocolate, woody caramel, warm inviting minty spice. Such a smooth chocolatey toasted oakiness with tons of vanilla

**Taste:** Chocolatey toasted oak, caramel, big sweet vanilla, sweet corn, warm spice, black cherry, mint, builds bigger with tobacco, smooth tannic oak and woody corn. This is like the essence of smooth heavy oak and vanilla but still has lots bold sweet corn coming through. We have this expectation of barrel proof these days to be an explosion of flavor. But this is big flavor that glides effortlessly across the tongue, and lands exactly where it needs to. It feels effortlessly confident in itself, not just a cacophony of flavor

**Finish:** Warm spice and black cherry, corn, toasted cherry wood with tons of vanilla, lingering sweet smooth toasted wood and corn

***************

Delicious, you almost can't even compare it by today's standards. It's that different. It's so oaky yet incredibly smooth even at 57%. It has an effortless quality to it, like the flavor just glides across the tongue and lands exactly where it needs to but still with that barrel proof kick. I have gotten this same ""effortless"" quality from some of the better Russell's Reserves, but never this good or quite this oaky. It reminds me of a bigger version of the dusty Wild Turkey 12 year, similar smooth heavy oak and vanilla kind of character. This truly is a legend. I've never had Bourbon that can satisfy oak-lust the way dusty Turkey can and this one is special.

Still I wouldn't say it's the best thing ever, or the end-all of Bourbon. It's fantastic but the big modern bruisers still have their place. The value of this stuff is in how unique it is compared to today's standards. I can't think of anything modern that is quite like this. Some of the better Russell's Reserves hit close but not this good.

I feel like everyone on this sub is afraid to give a bourbon a score of ""10"". Idk, just a hunch.
[deleted]
Not just one of the best Turkey's ever, but one of the greatest bourbons of all time.  Thanks for the great review!
I bet that tastes awesome!
Awesome review.  Legendary bottle.
Excellent write up. We‚Äôll try it.
One of the absolute best, no question.
How difficult is this to find secondary and what would be the expected cost?
I had this once at the end of a tasting of some great whiskey. They guy casually broke it out and gave us a pour. It absolutely floored us how good it was. Top 3 bottle for me.
700!!!! Congratulations and well done my man!
Very cool bottle and nice review.
It's something I have wrestled with actually. I can't speak for everyone else, but here's the way I see it: There should be no doubt in my mind about a 10. If I'm considering whether or not it's a 10, then it's not a 10. So really, a 9 is basically a top score with 10 being a rare level of perfection. If you handed out 10's all the time it it wouldn't mean as much. With all the hype this Bourbon gets, I was hoping it would be a 10. But I don't think it was quite there, exceptional as it was. 

I think I've only ever given out two 10's that I can think of, and neither was American Whiskey. One was a Brora 35 year Scotch and the other was DOK Trelawney rum. Maybe I am too stingy with 10's but that's just how I've done it
Its rare, but I have scored a bourbon perfectly before. It was a mini bottle of 1960`s Stitzel Weller.
If you give it a 10, then what it the next bourbon you have is better?
Elijah Craig Toasted Barrel is pretty close to 10.
A large factor is just the age. During the 80's and 90's there was a large surplus of well-aged Bourbon. Even a regular bottling like Wild Turkey 101 had an 8 year age statement on it, and very well could have had older stuff in the blend. They had enough old casks sitting around to do regularly available special bottlings like this that was 12-15 years old. But since then, demand for Bourbon has skyrocketed depleting those older stocks. So Bourbon has just gotten younger in general. There's other factors and theories too about what was different back then, it's a whole rabbit hole
It can be recreated, but its more expensive to do so. Since everyone is ok buying the bourbon produced by cheaper modern techniques, I dont think we will get ""old style"" bourbon anytime soon.
It was a pleasure to drink and review
A very quick search showed me $850ish or more.
Have you tried the bourbons that often get 10s? E.g. Michters 20, William Larue Weller
I would say Russell's Reserve 2003 was a 10 very similar notes to this
Hunt my flair.
Depends on how you define ""10"". If a ""10"" is defined as ""best ever"" (subjectively speaking of course) and one bourbon is given the rating of ""10"" and one subsequently comes across another bourbon that is also given a 10 then obviously one bourbon has to be downgraded in order for the other maintain ""best ever"" status. If that happens, then to me, it's no big deal. Again, a ""10"" just means it's the best whiskey **you** have ever tasted therefore the rankings are inherently dynamic and changing in nature as opposed to static. 

But for me, a ""10"" is simply a bourbon or whiskey that checks all the boxes of things I enjoy and/or look for in a bourbon/whiskey. For me, there are a few bourbons that do that for me so they are ""10's"". I may prefer one to another, but that would depend on the mood I'm in when I want to drink at any given time--not on differences in quality. 

Cheers mate!
Crank it up to 11.

What Cairdeas did you get? A lot are very cask driven, usually using some type of wine casks. But this one is 100% Bourbon barrel, it's a very clean and briny version of Laphroaig's medicinal peat.

The PX casked Cairdeas.  I also have a sherried version I plan to compare to when I get the chance.  The sherry cask is just a huge mouthful of flavors so I can't imagine what the Cairdeas is like.
The PX Cairdeas is a beast, it's really great. One of the better Cairdeas' I think. I'm just partial to Bourbon barrel Laphroaig"

Scotch review #285

************************************

**Bunnahabhain 2007 12 year ""Signatory Cask Strength,"" 1st fill sherry butt 58.1%**

**Nose:** Toffee, cereal malt, graham cracker, black licorice char, hot cinnamon cherry spice. Nice nose but simple and hot. Water smooths it out nicely, toffee, black cherry and brine 

**Taste:** Toffee, spice, funky toasted wood, gritty caramel, big blast of zingy cherry and spice heat. There's some sweetness here, but it's mostly Scotchy toffee and spice heat. Doesn't strike me as very sherried at all much less 1st fill. Water helps lighten it up and brings out more caramel and sugary cherry sweetness along with more measured spice. Gives it a lighter mouthfeel but worth the trouble

**Finish:** More sweetness emerges on the finish with sweet caramel and cherry, lots of spice, toasted wood, sweet char. Adding water helps calm down the spice and draw out the sweet finish, very nice

One of those rare cases where water actually helps it a lot. I usually find that once I'm adding water it's an attempt to improve something that I'm not enjoying and it does not work. The character here is a little toned down and simple, with too much spice heat. The water lightens it up and calms down the heat, lets some nice sweet flavor emerge. Nothing amazing but enjoyable once the heat has been tamed.

I got a similar bottle from cask 585, distilled on the same day but bottled two months later than yours. I'll try to report my own experience when i open it. Thanks for the review !
I had this same one! I had a similar experience I think. I found that it really needed some water as it was pretty hot, but as I added water it just kind of toned down the flavors for me and I couldn't identify many more flavors. For the price point, it wasn't as tasty as I'd hoped. I'd actually say I prefer Bunnahabhain 12 year to this.
Thanks for the review. Ngl I'm kinda disappointed reading the review. I'd expect a 12 year, first fill sherry at cask strength from bunnahabhain to be a knock out of the park. I've been eyeing a similar bottle from online and debating if it's worth it not. Guess I've got my answer. Cheers
Yeah that sounds about right for this bottle. For how outstanding bunnahabhain's OB bottlings are, the IB's can be very hit or miss. I've had better luck with peated ones
Yeah, it was decent but nothing special. These are hit and miss, I've had much better luck with peated bunnahabhain IB's sometimes called Staoisha. Those are usually great"

Brandy reviews #113-115

**********************************

**Lemorton Calvados 1999, 40%**

**Nose:** Decadent stewed apple/pear, rich caramel, brown sugar, twang of cinnamon and mint, chocolatey toasted wood, vanilla

**Taste:** Dry oak with a smooth kind of tannic astringency, muted tart apple, brown sugar, cinnamon, toasted oak and mild woody bitterness

**Finish:** Caramel, brown sugar, warm quiet apple, lingering dry tannic oak

* Very oaky, there's some tannins and bitterness but it stays pleasant at 40%. The palate doesn't quite live up to the exceptional toasted and caramel-y nose but it's still very good. Even in the older Calvados I've had the oak tends to be more reserved so it's fun to have one that walks that bitter line. Gives it a nice oaky complexity

**7/10**

**************************************

**Lemorton Calvados 1989, 40%**

**Nose:** Bold warm apple, mint, caramel, vanilla, toasted wood, tropical fruits, spice

**Taste:** Clean rich apple/pear, delightfully bold yet nicely balanced with sweet barrel notes, caramel, sweet toasted wood, vanilla, sugary fruits, spice

**Finish:** Apple/pear builds big and bright and sweet, caramel, sweet toasted wood, vanilla, lingering fruit

* This is a serious step up from the 99. Wood notes are on point with lots of smooth toasted sweetness and vanilla but the apple is still delicious and bold. Strikes a perfect balance

**8/10**

*********************************************

**Lemorton 1980, 40%**

**Nose:** Deep toasted wood, black cherry, vanilla, sweet char, tart fruits, mint. Very armagnac-y

**Taste:** Black cherry, spice, dark toasted wood, vanilla, subdued tart apple/pear, smooth tannic oak. A lot of Armagnac-like woodiness. Delicious and complex flavor, lighter mouthfeel

**Finish:** Apple/pear finally emerges bolder on the finish, cherry wood, dark sweet toasted oak, vanilla

* Wow I've never had a Calvados quite like this. It could almost pass for an Armagnac until the bright apple/pear emerges stronger on the finish. Lots of deeply toasted and heavy Armagnac style wood. It's delicious, bit of a light mouthfeel but that doesn't hurt it too much

*********************

**Glen Ord 2005 12 year ""Cadenhead's 175th,"" ex-bourbon 55.6%**

**Nose:** Crisp green apple, sugary barley, clean sweet malt, cake frosting, clean spice. Bright, happy, sweet and malty

**Taste:** Bright sweet barley, sugary tropical fruits, green apple, cereal and smooth clean malt, cake frosting, some zingy spice but not hot. Everything about this is bright and sweet and malty. It has some grittiness and spice to it from the abv, doesn't drink overly smooth at all. Excellent sugary malt bomb

**Finish:** Gets beautifully richer on the finish but stays sweet and malty. Gritty caramel, thick malt, a touch of toasted char, sweet barley, green apple, mellowing spice

**********

Glen Ord delivers again. I'm a big fan of malt bomb Scotches like this and Ord does it so well. They are really good at making a sweet and fruity barley-forward Scotch. Give it a light barrel influence, stand back and let the barley shine. I've yet to be disappointed by one.

Oh man, this sounds really good. *cake frosting and gritty caramel* can‚Äôt go wrong.
Thanks for the review! I have been eyeing one for a while now. It's the 11yr for $95. Have you had it buy chance?
I'm pretty sure u/Muskox has a review of that one alongside this.  You can get an idea how they compare.  They're very similar and it's definitely a safe buy if you like this style.

Re-reading my notes I think my score is a bit low on this bottle because I was looking for a waxier style of Glen Ord.  I got alot of bright fruit notes one this on a very malty base.
Don't think I have. What bottling is it, what are the specs?
I do! I didn't like this I've quite as much as Bucky, but it was definitely tasty and interesting.
Cadenhead Bottling. Distilled in 2006. 54.8% ABV. Based on color I am pretty sure it's Bourbon matured. Super light so guessing its a refill.
I would totally buy that. Based on my experience with Glen Ord I think it's a pretty safe bet if you like a malty Scotch
Awesome. I will take the leap then! Thanks for the recommendation."

Scotch review #283

**Glen Moray 18, 47.2%**

**Nose:** Malt, honey, toasted woodiness, sugary frosting, vanilla, hint of green apple, caramel, toasted marshmallow, light mint

**Taste:** Toasted wood, oaky char, sweet vanilla cream, tropical fruits, honeyed malt, caramel, friendly spice. Big flavorful and dynamic mouthfeel. Decent wood presence and sweetness, balanced and drinkable and very Scotchy still. Delivers on being a smooth 1st fill malty Scotch

**Finish:** Smooth vanilla toasted wood, sweet icing, honey, rich barley, light lingering wood spice. A delicious and decently long finish

*************

Great example of a sweet woody Scotch with the approachability and balance of a well-aged OB bottling. Wood can be a delicate thing, many single cask IB's can over-oak you with a 1st fill. This has been blended to deliver it just right. A bit of char and oak and plenty of sweet barrel notes to compliment the rich fruity malt. One of the better OB 18 year bottlings I've had and a great malty Scotch without having to take the chance on an IB

Thanks for the review.  I haven‚Äôt tried anything from this distillery, but I see it everywhere.  I see this one priced at $105 which seems like a great bargain.
Very good bottling. Used to be 85 bucks near me ahah. Their 25 is personal fav of mine
This is prob the only one of the OB lineup I‚Äôd think about getting if I had to. That said, I found it resinous (think Pine-Sol) and over oaked for my tastes - but I‚Äôm very glad you like it!
Thanks for the review, I was just thinking about the scant number of opinions on this one here. I found a bottle recently for $80 and am looking forward to cracking it after moving next month, especially since like you I seem to really fall for these rich malt-forward whiskies.
I thought this might be right up your alley.  It's extremely bourbony.  I think the only OB I've had that carries more bourbon notes forward is Glen Grant 15, which isn't exactly getting alot of love these days.  I don't disagree with u/othromas about the resinous notes.  I found they faded after the neck pour and some rest.  When I came back to the bottle I found those rich vanilla and icing bourbon notes and less the pine and mint I find frequently enough in first fill ex-bourbon.
I sampled an open bottle of this recently and believe the bottle had been open for some time.  The flavors were weak and the presentation was a bit watery, but this review gives me hope that maybe I just had a bad experience.  I want high quality whisky to be available at the $100 range so I'm gonna seek out a different sample.  Thanks!
Nice review, good to hear they didn't overdo it on the oak. Glen Moray for awhile there was something always at the table, as SMWS had a bunch of releases for a bit there.

> This is Glen Moray's standard 8 year bottling.

Think you missed a 1 at the start.
The 12 was the first bottle I ever bought and still one of my favorites to this day
Yeah, that's fair. A little bit of astringent oak does come through but I think it stays well-balanced. Definitely on the oaky side for a Scotch though which is kind of brave of them to do since most 18's are more sherried.

Happy cake day!
I almost put tannins and astringency in my notes, I think that's the resin/pine thing you guys are talking about. But that sounded like a negative, it was so well-integrated I just called it a strong oak presence overall
Interesting. Patience bears a lot of fruit‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôll keep an eye out. Perhaps the second pour I had of this was off the neck as well - and I know I didn‚Äôt give it any time in the glass.
Thanks, edited

I haven't delved into Glen Moray IB's very much, but I've always liked what I've had from them for what it is
Thanks!

Yeah, I had a flight of their OBs and it was the standout. I tried it again on a subsequent visit (it‚Äôs a friend‚Äôs favorite distillery) and just couldn‚Äôt quite pull the trigger on buying it. I wanted to see what else that trip was going to bring‚Ä¶"

American Whiskey review #265

**************

**""WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel"" Shared Pour #3165, 52.7%**

**Nose:** Butterscotch, cinnamon, fresh green rye grain, mustiness, light sweet caramel, menthol and peppery spice, hot cinnamon cherry

**Taste:** Cinnamon, butterscotch, cream pastry, green rye, bright citrus, peppery spice heat. Clean rye flavor, sweet and butterscotchy with cinnamon and spice

**Finish:** Cinnamon strudel, green apple, butterscotch, cherry, mouth-tingling rye spice and cinnamon

********************

As someone who has been obsessed with WhistlePig single barrels for quite some time and gone through many bottles & tastings, I really think the Rye they are sourcing these days changed around the time they switched labels. They used to be much more oaky and noticeably darker in color. I suspect that this stuff nowadays comes from tired refill casks, which is why you see 15-18 year old barrels that are still very spirit driven. Even this one is supposedly about 15.5 years old, and not nearly as oaky as you would expect at that age. It's not necessarily a bad thing though, just different. I miss those old richer single barrels but these are fun in their own way. You get an almost Scotch-like Rye experience, where you have the depth and maturity of age but the grain can still shine. Tasty Rye even if it's not quite as good as the full American style oak presence we used to get in these.

For a company that admitted to over pricing by 50% ‚Äúbecause they‚Äôll pay‚Äù;  good on ya
I just cracked a 10yr Whistle Pig that was MGP distillate. In my mind that is where their downfall began. 

The Boss Hog is a banger bottle, but who wants to drop the kind of dough?
Never heard of shared pour. Checked their site. Left. Boy, those pricings are beyond crazy. Way too expensive.
I'm a big fan of rye and there isn't much out there in the way of well-aged 100% rye mashbills. It's basically this and MGP(95% I know). And honestly, I don't think the price is all that bad considering it's cask strength with a 10 year age statement. I used to pay $80-$90 for these 5 years ago and the price hasn't risen much.

However, with the quality going down I might agree that these aren't worth the price as much as they used to be. I've had better ones that are, but these aren't a sure bet anymore
It's a retailer that some of the r/Bourbon picks are sold through
As long as you know their pricing model, go for it. 
For me there are drinkable ryes in the $40-$50 range all day."

A standard 12 and 16 year, an exclusive 30 year single cask, and 8 year ""high proof 49%."" An interesting fact about these is that they apparently use a lot of pear in the recipes, as much as 60-70%. I decided it would be fun to do them all together. I drank them over several sittings, alternating between single pours and side-by-sides.

Brandy reviews #109-112

*********************************

**Pacory 12 year Calvados, 42%**

**Nose:** Big bold apple/pear, viscous caramel, smooth wood, sugary sweetness

**Taste:** Creamy caramel, bold apple/pear, cinnamon, sugary caramel apple, smooth wood

**Finish:** Tart apple/pear, creamy caramel, mild spice, soft sweet wood

* A really nice caramel presence, bold apple/pear that has a warm softness melding with the caramel. Maintains a nice sugary sweetness, it's not super woody or super bright just perfectly balanced in the middle. Great stuff with a great mouthfeel **7/10** 

******************************

**Pacory 16 year Calvados, 41%**

**Nose:** Bright apple, tart ripe pear, creamy-sweet caramel, sweet balanced tartness,  sugary vanilla icing

**Taste:** Bright pop of apple and pear, big sweet caramel, wood, light spice, sugary-sweet icing, light sweet tartness. Sweet, bold and complex. It pops and really comes alive

**Finish:** Wood, a light sweet char, bold sugary apple/pear, vanilla icing, delicious spice

* Fantastic, super drinkable. It's so sweet, the apple notes are bold and perfectly balanced with just enough wood and big sweet caramel. Not super woody or old feeling at all, the extra age seems to have only given it more caramel and bright sweetness with no tannins or heavy oak  **8/10**

******************************

**Pacory 30 year Calvados K&L single cask, 41%**

**Nose:** Caramel apple, toffee, minty spice, smooth toasted wood, vanilla

**Taste:** Smooth tannic oak, woody caramel, muted apple, lightly toasted, anise, feels dry and lightly woody with muted fruitiness

**Finish:** Bolder apple/pear peaks through, caramel, smooth oak, lingering musty wood and light fruit

* More wood on this one but still not an oak bomb at all. Lightly dry and tannic with some caramel and a muted fruitiness. Well-balanced at the low abv but the dryness and light tannins gives this a noticeably lighter mouthfeel than the rest. Tasty light and dry woody Calvados **6/10**

*******************************

**Pacory 8 year ""High Proof"" 49%**

**Nose:** Syrupy apple, gritty caramel, overripe pear, spice heat

**Taste:** Syrupy-sweet apple, hot cinnamon spice, crisp tartness, sticky caramel. Sweet and sugary and a touch hot but not too much at 49%

**Finish:** Spice, sweet sugary apple/pear, sugary caramel, some heat on the tail end

* Very straightforward, it's basically big sugary blast of apple/pear and spice with a dash of caramel. The heat isn't bad but maybe just a little unbalanced, I enjoy sipping on the lower proof ones more. But it's still a tasty Calvados. The big syrupy-sweet flavor and spice is a lot of fun. I bet this would make a great mixer too if you are into that kind of thing **6/10**

**************

**Final Thoughts:** These all have a nice sweet caramel presence, even the younger 8 and 12 year bottles. Makes for a really delicious character along with the big apple/pear notes. I enjoyed them all, but 16 year is the clear winner for me with 12 year being a close second. The 12 year is a beautiful balance of big bold apple/pear and sweet caramel, it hits just right with a nice rich mouthfeel. The 16 year is big and vibrant and complex, the extra age didn't weigh it down with oak at all. It has more complexity and sweetness and really pops. 30 year is nice but feels a little too dry and tannic which I think doesn't work well for me with how light it is. 8 year is good, it's straightforward and fun with the big blast of flavor. My preference is 16>12>8>30

I believe this is my first Blair Athol, and I really like it. I know I've heard of some bad ones too though, so I'm still a little cautious. If anything it speaks well for Single Cask Nation which has a stellar record in my experience. They just bottle some really great stuff. Always happy to enjoy a new distillery too.

Whoah. 

Where did you get this from? Wife and I bought a bottle of Blair Athol directly from the distillery when we went on a tour during our honeymoon trip to Scotland. We had understood that it was the only way to get it, as most of their scotch they produce is used for blended scotches under other labels.

I always thought this was a shame, as it's quite a tasty dram. 

We've been nursing that bottle for years, and it's almost done. If we could get another, it would be fantastic. Any info you can provide would be appreciated!
This might be the first time I‚Äôve ever seen a cask listed as refill PX. But I suppose they must be around. Sounds a bit more subtle than the first fill casks.
Yup, $99.00 @ Binny‚Äôs. Just finished a bottle of this and really enjoyed it. I think Blair Athol is best with either Sherry aged or finished. Another really nice review.
It's a lot more common from independent bottlers who get casks that might have been intended to blends, but get diverted into single cask bottlings. e.g. here's a list of Blair Athol bottled last year.

https://whiskybase.com/search?style=table&q=blair%20athol&bottler=&brandname=&vintage\_year=&bottle\_date\_year=2021&itemsforsale=&rating=
It's true, I don't think Blair Athol has an official bottling of it's own. But there are a lot of independent bottlers out there that buy and bottle casks for themselves. The quality can vary so they can be a risk, but there are some true gems to be found. This one I reviewed is from an independent bottler called Single Cask Nation who is pretty reliably good

As an example here are some on FineDrams, they are a Scotch site that ships all over. They have some from Signatory which can be a pretty good bottler https://www.finedrams.com/search?q=blair+athol
Leave it to Single Cask Nation to get specific with the cask info
I mean pretty much everything that will have had a longer maturation in PX will be second fill or refill.
Have you had Blair Athol that was matured in a Hogshead for 10 years? Reason I ask is I stumbled upon a 10 year old Signatory bottling at CS but it was matured in a Hogshead and not in a Sherry cask. It had a very pale colour.
Wow. TIL... 

Thanks! Now to see how i can get my hands on something...
Perfect, thank you sir! Ive got 11 months to find it and impress the mrs before the next anniversary lol

This is about as close as you‚Äôll get.
No, sadly I haven‚Äôt. It does sound interesting. I‚Äôve found that Blair Athol can be a bit hit and miss but I‚Äôve always found those Signatory bottlings to be pretty good. Let me know what you think of it, if you pick it up.

**Nose:** THICC meaty malt, buttery, big sweet barley, vanilla, smooth cereal, hay, honey, sugary frosting, warm tropical fruits. It's so malty with a thick buttery softness. Ridiculously delicious and inviting

**Taste:** Wow, this is malt heaven. Thick buttery mouthfeel coats the mouth in barley goodness. THICC meaty malt, big sweet barley, buttery and smooth, happy tropical fruits, faint lemon zest, rich honey, hay and cereal notes. This is a total showcase for thick sweet barley. Thick oily mouthfeel and velvety soft at 51%. Goes down so easy it's so freaking good. 

**Finish:** No complex surprises here, the malty perfection just keeps on coming. Sweet barley sugar, pop of light sweet spice, cake frosting, hint of gritty vanilla char. A long, sugary-sweet barley finish

*****************

I've always been a huge fan of malty Bourbon-barrel Scotch, and holy shit this is about as good as it gets. It's a wonderful combination of thick barley and velvety soft smoothness. So smooth at 51% but it doesn't sacrifice any flavor or mouthfeel. An amazing malt bomb. As a side-note, I am loving these Signatory releases that combine several casks together. I think we tend to get a bit romantic over the idea of a ""single cask"" in the Whisky world, but so far I have found these double cask bottlings to be delicious and extremely well-balanced. Meanwhile, not every single cask is a winner on it's own lol. Bottles like this are why I drink Scotch

Anything finished from springbank goes for stupid money now, shame really as trying this would be awesome. 

I love longrow, it's got the peat bang on but even the 10 year red bottles are going for ¬£100+ now and as good as they are, they are not *that* good.
Great notes, I remember falling in love with this bottling!
Does it say Sauternes on the bottle anywhere?
It‚Äôs stated on the label that‚Äôs on the back of the bottle.

"Review #685: Tomatin 1989 26 year Hart Brothers, 45.7%",,https://i.redd.it/1rla4q4vvzv81.jpg,"Another one of the older Hart Brothers bottlings that K&L has been getting in over the last year or so. This one was going for $210 but has been put on clearance and is currently available for $157. No info given on cask type. 

Scotch review #279

**************

**Tomatin 1989 26 year Hart Brothers Finest Collection, 45.7%**

**Nose:** Hay, cereal malt, slight musty funk, honey, light green apple and tropical fruits, hint of fennel spice. It's a nice delicate sweet and malty nose, honey and smooth cereal malt

**Taste:** Honey, vanilla icing, smooth cereal malt, light funk, just a hint of light fruits brighten it up, mild friendly spice. It's very straightforward and well-balanced. Light, sweet, with a friendly maltiness to it. Nice flavor and super drinkable but on the lighter side

**Finish:** Brightens slightly with sugary pastry, vanilla icing and tropical fruits, then richer honey, warm cereal malt, trails off into some lingereing light root beer char that puts a nice little ending to the finish

*****************

Classic well-aged malty Scotch profile. It drinks like the 45.7% it comes in at, smooth and friendly but not overly delicate. Old refill Bourbon barrel Scotch(which I assume this is) can have a more delicate character anyway, and it does that well. With age like this it's more about the nuance and effortless balance of the complex notes. This one is just missing some of the bigger bolder and brighter notes that can really elevate things. It's plenty good, it won't disappoint if you're looking for something old it's just not quite amazing. I think the $200 it was originally going for was too high, but you can't ask for much better than $157 for something this old. Straightforward old well-aged malty Scotch at a drinkable OB strength.

Brandy review #108

****************

**L'Encantada Domaine Lous Pibous #186, 1996 25 year, 55.6%**

**Nose:** Thick cherry, toffee, vanilla, cool spice, deep toasted oak, mildly tannic, tobacco, thick creamy caramel, dark wood char. Lots of cherry, tons of dark wood, has a thickness to it

**Taste:** Sweet charred toasted oak, big sweet cherry, dark tannic oak, toffee, cool spice, creamy caramel, big vanilla. Big flavor, great depth and mouthfeel. It drinks amazingly well at 55%. Bold flavor with no real spice heat to speak of. Darkly sweet and tannic but almost creamy at the same time. 

**Finish:** Complex oak notes, sweetly charred and beautifully toasted, tannic oak, coffee, building spice, creamy caramel, sweet cherry, vanilla. Lingers with cherry and sweet vanilla char

*************

This stuff is a delight to sip on. I've had Pibous that is maybe bigger and bolder, more spice and a bigger cask strength assault. This one just feels so right. It drinks great, no real heat, all the flavor is on point. For how dark and oaky it is, it has a thick almost creamy quality and tons of cherry sweetness. Loving this

Just caught a funny little moment from Garak on DS9,"S3E5 ""Second Skin"" Garak is talking to Bashir about a trip that the Doctor recently took, and has an interesting line that is easy to miss:

**GARAK:** So how was your trip to Klaestron Four?

**BASHIR:** Oh, terrific. The Klaestrons have developed a burn treatment technology which has to be seen to be believed.

**GARAK:** You know, I envy you.

**BASHIR:** How so?

**GARAK:** When I was younger, travelling was a bit of a passion for me. There are few things in life that compare with the thrill of immersing yourself in the culture of an alien world, meeting the inhabitants, earning their trust. But aside from our brief excursion to Bajor, I don't think I've been off this station in nearly three years.

Slipping in that bit about ""earning the trust"" of alien inhabitants makes it sound like these probably aren't simple holidays he's reminiscing about haha. Maybe I'm reading too much into it but to me it sounds like one of his many little allusions to his clandestine history. And the moment is gone as soon as he says it, the conversation just moves on. Bashir doesn't even seem to catch it",https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/ub8kwt/just_caught_a_funny_little_moment_from_garak_on/,"*The first duty of every Starfleet officer is to the truth. Whether it's scientific truth, or historical truth, or personal truth. It is the guiding principle upon which Starfleet is based.

What clandestine history?  He‚Äôs just a plain simple tailor.
Awesome character Garak. The actor Andrew Robinson also wrote a book about Garak called ‚ÄúA stitch in time.‚Äù It‚Äôs about Garak as a cadet in his early days.
Garak's just a simple tailor, and occasionally a Gardner...
Gotta love plain, simple Garak.
I noticed that last time too. Like who would use that phrase except for an anthropologist or a spy
could be a reference to the galaxy being wary of Cardassians in general.
I'm a simple man. I see a Garak-centric post ... I up-vote it.
I mean..I don't think that was intentional. But I can see why you'd think it. He also mentioned in another episode being a Gardener at a romulan embassy when the cover story was more exciting than the actual assignment. That's the intential one.
Robinson kept a diary as Garak to help him build the deep context of the character subtlety in order to convey it better.  The line definitely was intentional.

(Not sure if he ever dreamed we would still be discussing and debating it almost 30 years later)
I caught that when I first saw it on TV many many years ago.

He was definitely alluding to the fact that his visits to other planets were not done with good intentions.  And that is part of the reason why he can't really leave DS9 station.
Seems like a straight up admission of his intentions on ds9. Has e he betrayed them in the end we‚Äôd look at this quote very differently.
>... immersing yourself in the culture of an alien world ... 

Like with Bajorans and Humans on DS9 Garrick? By the way I have a new skirt I need hemmed.
Oh, he caught it. LOL.
""Meeting the people of a new world, discovering their weaknesses, reporting back to Command...""
His travel involves interrogation and assassination.  Garak‚Äôs book, A Stitch in Time, details this.
>There are few things in life that compare with the thrill of immersing yourself in the culture of an alien world, meeting the inhabitants, earning their trust. But aside from our brief excursion to Bajor, I don't think I've been off this station in nearly three years.

Garak is just amusing himself because it's exactly what he has been doing on Deep Space Nine: immersing himself in the culture, meeting the inhabitants, and earning their trust.
And gardener. And if the anecdotes of certain deceased diplomats are to be believed, a courtesan.
Plain, simple, Garak.
[deleted]
I love that he continues to insist on it when nobody even plays along with it and addresses the fact that he's a spy openly. Even after years, he still calls himself a tailor and for no reason, he gains nothing but trying to trick friends who have done incredible dirt with him
Came here for this comment
Haha this is perfect. I can see his smiling face as I read it
He also knows how to plant explosives on people‚Äôs starships that will blow up at just the right time and and awful lot about creating falsified data in order to bring an entire race of beings into an galaxy wide war, all while outsmarting and being one step ahead of Sisko. Tailoring school on Cardasia must be pretty intense, he‚Äôs taken a lot of gen-eds
A very good book about his life. Especially the lies.
[deleted]
Thanks! I‚Äôd love to read this!
Lmao at how they bring him along just to make cryptic remarks about his past to keep Odo distracted from the fact that he was undergoing fatal cellular degeneration.
Why wouldn't a tailor or a humble shopkeeper would want to endear himself to his clients?
Or a reference to being wary of tourists generally. I mean, show me the tourist area where the locals *don't* make the ""if it's tourist season, why can't we shoot them?"" among themselves. 

But this is Elim Garak we're talking about, here, so probably neither of those...
Bashir suspected him as a spy from day one, Garak knows this, and he knows that the young doctor is well versed in subtlety. It was absolutely intentional.
I could definitely be reading too much into it. But Garak is one of my favorite characters on DS9 and he always has such concise and intentional wording, and a very quick wit. So I just think it's too much to be a coincidence coming from him. If it wasn't actually written that way then it's a happy accident because it works well for his character
It was probably intentional. It‚Äôs exactly the way Garak is written.

> QUARK: I should've listened to my cousin Gaila. He said to me, Quark, I've got one word for you. *Weapons*. No one ever went broke selling weapons. But did I take his advice? No. And why not? Because I'm a people person! I like interacting with my customers, like you and I are doing right now. Talking to each other, getting to know one another‚Ä¶
> 
> GARAK: I can see the attraction‚Ä¶for *you*.
> And if the anecdotes of certain deceased diplomats are to be believed, a courtesan.

What's this, now?
Plain, simple, definitely-not-throbbing for Bashir, Garak.... the tailor.
Don't trust that cobbler.
It's like the Cardassian murder mystery novel he recommended to Bashir. Everyone knows the condemned is guilty, but figuring out exactly what he was guilty of and how he did the crime is the whole point of it. Everyone knows Garak was a spy, but since it can't be proven, the mystery is still there.
He likes being a tailor, you see.
>Even after years, he still calls himself a tailor and for no reason

He did work as a tailor and had a business. People went there for tailoring.
What do you mean? It's all true. Especially the lies.
I mean, that gets explained when he tells Worf he wants to join Starfleet. Lying is a skill that requires practice. 

Of course, he contradicts another line about not telling the same lie twice, but, well. He's Garak.
It reads like a diary or a log book. Like when the actors narrate their day on the show, only darker.Obsidian Order are a mean bunch of cut-throats especially to each other.
> well versed in subtlety

Season 1 bashir is about as subtle as a fire truck
Julian ""You want me to buy a suit?"" Bashir well -versed in subtlety? idkkkk
Without referening. Which season was this one from? I know they eluded to his past early but there wasn't ever an obsidion order link til a bit later.  But yeh I agree clues were always there. He was eluded as a spy in a very early s1 episode. I get your point and salute you ;)
The delivery of ""because I'm a *people person*"" is so good, in that moment he's really selling his bullshit, his financial mistake wasn't a missed opportunity, he's just too nice to really chase money, the only fault of his character is that he's too lovable
Why do I get the feeling Columbo would have been a very show over there?
It's crazy how his character starts as a federation bikini inspector
You can hear some of the eye roll in Sisko's voice when he tells Bashir that yes, he should go get fitted for that suit.
Knowing what we do now(Bashir is a mutant), he might just be overplaying the dumb.
""Ah, just one last thing that puzzles me...""
I... don't quite know?"

They are all available on Finedrams, this one goes for about $220

Brandy review #107

***************

**Jean-Luc Pasquet Cognac Grande Champagne ""Lot 75"" afish pick, 54.2%**

**Nose:** Dark sweetly toasted Cognac wood, tobacco, light rancio, chocolate, mellow layer of nose-tingling wood spice, vanilla char, mint, dark grape. Classic heavy oaked Cognac, I love the combination of dark wood notes but with the dry almost delicate feel of a Cognac. 

**Taste:** The heavy wood really comes alive on the palate. Big dark toasted oak, tobacco, vanilla, dark chocolate, caramel, lifting spice, dark cherry and grape, smooth dark oak tannins, light mint. Dark toasted oak that has a refined elegance to it in that way that Cognac does so well. Heavy oak unravels smoothly, doesn't assault the palate

**Finish:** Vanilla, dark sweetly toasted wood, smooth tannins, caramel, dry wood spice, barrel char. Keeps in character all the way through til the end, wonderful with no real surprises

*************

This is easily the oakiest of the three picks, and it's also the darkest so the color doesn't lie. It has the least complexity of the group but I don't mean that in a bad way. It has a simple elegance to it, a dark oaky Cognac smoothness. Heavy oak but not a beast about it if that makes sense. I'm an oak fiend so this was my immediate favorite of the three on my initial tasting. 

But going through all these again for my reviews, I've grown to love the other two by a lot. It's hard to pick a favorite now. They each have their own strengths. I would say this 75 and the 68-72 are more similar to each other, both on the oakier side. 75 being more of the oak bomb and 68-72 being bigger and bolder overall but balanced by a little more sweetness. 70 is it's own thing, bright and creamy and oaky and super complex. I still think these are all winners

*************

**Jean-Luc Pasquet Cognac Grande Champagne ""Lot 70"" afish pick, 52.1%**

**Nose:** Butterscotch, caramel, orange citrus, smooth tannic oak, gritty graham cracker and nuttiness, green apple, delicious spice, barrel char. Thick and warm and butterscotchy with tons of lively complexity 

**Taste:** Butterscotch, charred wood, sweet green apple, caramel, bright citrus, wood spice, smooth tannic oak, toasted nuttiness, understated tart berry, buttery wood, sweet bright spice. It has a creaminess, and it keeps building brighter and sweeter, but is well-balanced by the richer notes of buttery wood and thick butterscotch and charred oak. It's so complex and fun 

**Finish:** Builds big and sweet, caramel, orange citrus, smooth tannic wood, nuttiness, holiday spice, sweet char, butterscotchy goodness, tart berries. Creamy and sweet finish with a nice smooth oakiness, just wow amazing to the end 

****************

As with the 68-72, this stuff is only growing on me the more I drink it. I think it's the most unique of the three. The 68-72 and the 75 are both more oaky, like different shades of oak. This one is brighter and creamier. Butterscotch and nutty caramel, green apple. But it still has this rich buttery and smooth oakiness to it. The complexity is unreal. I might still prefer 75 for personal preference because I'm a bit of an oak fiend, I'll be reviewing that one next to find out for sure. But there's just no denying the quality here

Thanks for stating the price up front.   This stuff sounds delicious. 

Do you cut with water ever?  Or always neat?

Great review.
Agree the lot70 has an infinite number of flavors hiding within and the most intense nose experience of the 3 listed. I also enjoyed how the buttery sweet notes started to poke out with extra time in the glass. Great pour A+
I almost always drink neat. Usually if I'm adding water at all it means that it needs a little help or I'm not totally enjoying it, and I'm attempting to help it. Which isn't usually a good sign. I will occasionally add water to enjoy something differently, or if I'm in the mood for a certain profile but not cask strength, but I don't usually do something like that in a review
I tend to be drawn to heavier oak, so I didn't fully appreciate this one at first compared to the other two. I'm glad to have revisited it because it is just wonderful"

**************

**Jean-Luc Pasquet Cognac Fins Bois ""Lot 68-72"" afish pick, 57.1%**

**Nose:**  Milk chocolate and floral wood, silky-smooth tannic oak, sweet toffee, vanilla, cedar, wood spice, honey, sweet berries and strawberry, even a little tropical fruit comes through. It's quite woody but also feels smoothly sweet, notes are lifting and happy

**Taste:** Big sweet toasted wood and wood spice, mint, gritty toffee, milk chocolate, sweet sugary fruits of green apple, cherry, grape, easygoing honeyed floralness, smooth tannic wood, graham cracker, vanilla char, big dose of floral and peppery spice. Quite woody with a fair amount of spice, but still has a super inviting pleasant sweetness to it. Big, bold, sweet and woody mouthfeel

**Finish:**Wood spice, mint, milk chocolate, smooth toasted wood, toasted marshmallow, sweet berries and cherry, tropical fruits. Finishes big and bright and sweet with that wonderful edge of heavy sweet wood. Long finish the whole thing is deceivingly complex 

***********

So on my initial tasting of these I had picked 75 as my favorite, but taking these out to review I noticed something interesting: The level on this bottle is considerably lower than the 75 already. That's got to count for something haha. I already loved it but I think it has grown on me even more as I've drank it. It's woody and sweet with a big bang of a mouthfeel, and deceivingly complex.

Brandy review #104

******************

**Domaine de Baraillon Bas-Armagnac 1973 46 year, 47%**

**Nose:** Dank wet barnyard wood, rich mahogany, vanilla, barrel char, toffee, some fruity grape and dark cherry comes through, coffee, old slightly bitter woodiness, cool minty spice. It's a rich dank woodiness that stays pleasant and well-balanced, not overly oaked or tannic

**Taste:** Dank wet wood, cutting slightly bitter oak, gritty tannic oak and graham cracker you can almost chew on, some warmer notes of thick vanilla, caramel, strong fruity grape. Some perfumey floral notes pop up, wood spice. the whole thing is complex yet very cohesive, it feels warm and woody and old. There's some bitterness but it's not overwhelming and helps with that nice ""old"" feel it has. Plenty of fruit and sweetness too

**Finish:** Peppery spice builds, slowly settles into rich antique wood and caramel, slightly bitter, fruity grape, tannic oak, mellow wood spice. It's a long finish that lingers, old dank and woody but fruity and sweet too. There's bitterness but I like it

**************

I really love this, it's maybe just a touch rough around the edges but nothing that comes close to unpleasant. The wood gets a little acrid at times but I think it adds to the ancient woody feel. Like you can really taste the age on it. It's well balanced by the sweet fruit, vanilla and caramel and it comes together in that super warm and cohesive way that Baraillon is really good at. A great, oooold-feeling Armagnac that gives you more than just a tannic oak bomb

Scotch review#278

*****************

**Springbank 12 Cask Strength, 56.1%**

**Nose:** Toffee, milk chocolate, earthy charred funk, wood spice, brine, rich caramel malt, big toasted wood, vanilla, chocolate-covered red fruits. Wow 

**Taste:** Smooth earthiness and smoky funk, dark toasted malt, chocolate, toffee, toasted wood, spice, vanilla, down and dirty char, brine, some sugary honeyed red fruits that gives it a nice sweet layer, big spice. Big powerful flavor and so complex. Has smoke and earthy funk and rich toffee malt, but it also has this smooth approachable sweetness to it.    

**Finish:** Big pop of sweet spice, strawberry wine, sugary honeyed fruit, sweet toasted wood, vanilla, toffee, smooth chocolatey smokiness, char. It immediately hits surprisingly bright and sweet before descending into that wonderful Springbank smoky funky richness

********************

I've maybe had some better 12 year Cask Strength, but not by much. It's splitting hairs really this is fantastic. All the trademark Springbank flavor and depth you hope for in one of these. The wine influence is subtle, adds a sweet layer but it really melds into the whole experience. I wish I had a little more familiarity with other batches to say how much the wine influence stands out here compared to more standard bottlings. All I can say is that this is such a fantastic distillery and a fantastic Scotch

Terrific review! Thanks. 
This one's definitely on my radar now. Actually, this and the 10-year old. When I first started in scotch, 3 of my first 5 bottles were Springbank and quickly burnt out on it. lol... I'm trying to ease myself back in.
Ah, another really nice review and, I‚Äôve missed that monkey. So, 2020 bottling. Just sounds great. I have a 56.2% 12 year old that I think I bought in 2017 or 18? It‚Äôs fantastic. These bottles are hard to find now in the Chicago area. Are they available near you?
As far as I know, this batch was the first to use burgundy barrels, and it is among my top three favorite scotches. I bought as many as I could find and will be really sad when I run out.
I had this and had to get a second bottle. Can confirm it‚Äôs fantastic.
Great review - really captures that nature of it.
This stuff is sublime and - for me at least - very much what Springbank is about. What I love is that it‚Äôs not trying to be anything but itself. It‚Äôs pleasingly assertive and wonderfully layered. So much going on. And decidedly grubby.
56.1 is the best batch. Enjoy!
I have about a third of mine left and I wish I had another bottle. It was very hot when I first opened it though. Not sure if you had that experience.
This is a killer batch. Wish I bought a backup
Bit of a Campbeltown enthusiast myself. Introduced about 4 years ago by very kind and generous friends, when I was but a lowly (long-time) bourbon and rye drinker.

I‚Äôve tasted about half a dozen (maybe more) of these 12 Year Cask Strength bottlings since that introduction. I own 4 or 5 at the moment, including some of the older label batches. Aside from this one, I‚Äôve tasted 70% sherried, 30% sherried, and 100% bourbon matured. Wasn‚Äôt at all impressed by the bourbon matured bottling, but the bottle hasn‚Äôt been open long enough to pass fair judgement.I haven‚Äôt yet tried one of the 100% sherried bottlings. Also a cask strength Longrow fan, generally.

This version, which I‚Äôve tasted now on three occasions, is easily my favorite. So much of everything that we all love about Campbeltown malt, in perfect proportion, and amplified.

Dark fruits, cola, thick and oily, coal-fired locomotive, chocolate and char, toffee. It‚Äôs incredible.

One of our group has last year‚Äôs 100% sherried Local Barley 10Yr, and at this stage in the bottles‚Äô development (it IS Springbank, after all), this Covid Batch in his very colorful language ‚Äúsh*ts all over my 10Yr Local Barley‚Äù. That translates to, ‚ÄúI much prefer this batch of Springbank 12 to the 100% Sherried Local Barley 10.‚Äù

An easy 8.5 to me for the 1st half of the bottle. Solid 9 during the 2nd half. What magic.

(For reference, I have shared, and/or owned, and tasted 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, and 19 year old Springbank and Longrow single casks with maturation in Sauternes, Madeira, fresh and refill Sherry, Rum, and port casks.)

I don‚Äôt really understand any comparison to Black Art. Unpeated and usually so delicate. I found last years release so boring. That‚Äôs down to the relatively low abv I suppose. Hope I don‚Äôt step on anyones‚Äô toes. It is very expensive. Maybe the bottle just needs a lot of time to open up. I could see that being the case, especially with such old spirit. I‚Äôm no Bruichladdich expert, though I do love me some Octomore.
I got a bottle of this for the holidays and it is one of the best scotches I‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs up there with Dark Cove and Black Art for me. Thank you for the excellent review. I give your review a 9/10. Jk, it‚Äôs a 10
I love this one and feel like the Burgundy barrels are what push this one over the top. Most Mars Bar nose I've had on a whisky.
Sadly, Springbank in general has become very hyped. These move very quick, even the regular 10 year goes for around $90 and none of them sit on shelves very long
Yo, hit up storied company in Indy if you get the chance, pretty sure Denis still has a few of these
Thank you so much! Capturing the nature of a pour is what I'm trying to do, so I'm glad you enjoyed my review. And yes totally agree, Springbank is very good at having it's own distinct character
Reviewing a review haha. Yeah it's a pretty special Scotch
It‚Äôs good. Nowhere near Black Art good though (in my opinion).
Same here. Sadly the 10 yr old is $99 and going fast. I remember the old days ( 3-4 years ago) Binnys  had many bottles of Springbank. Shits gone crazy! Ah well, at least there‚Äôs lots of Ben Nevis around‚Ä¶ wait a minute‚Ä¶
Thanks. Will be in the area this weekend. I‚Äôve stopped in once, fun store.
Denis had one that he would have held for me but I went for a new bourbon cask aged, 24 year old Ben Nevis, Single Malts of Scotland bottling. I'm hoping to pick it up tomorrow. He says it's amazing. I'll let you know how it is.  I have a bottle of a Springbank 12 yo cs 56.2% so I passed on the Springbank 12 yo cs he has, as it is tax day and I'm feeling a bit broke ( not too bad but hard to pull the trigger on 2 bottles)
I give his review of your review a 6.5/10. I found his information lacking. It wasn't horrible though and perhaps it will work as mixer review.
I‚Äôm in Madison. I remember first discovering Binny‚Äôs down there around 2011 and finding shelves spilling with all kinds of Longrows. Some vintage-dated (1995? 1996?) 10-years stand out in my memory.

If my marital situation was different, I‚Äôd‚Äôve stocked up.
Oh wow, I didn‚Äôt know he had that.  Send me details on it sometime!
Hey, hows it going? Went to school at Madison now down in the Chicago area, north suburbs.  Yea, same here. I discovered Scotch about 2010. Great time to get into Scotch. Binny's had so many different bottlings of many of the distilleries. I just didn't know what I know now. There must have been 20-25 different bottlings of Bruichladdich, many different Springbanks, Macallan 10 yo, cs. There were some great IB bottles as well. Lots of Blackadder.  I did stock up a little over the years but not as much as I am now wishing I had. Even as little as 3 years ago or so, they had a nice selection but their selection seems to be getting very thin these days. Are you noticing that in the Madison area as well? 
I'm thinking it's a lot like this for bourbon drinkers as well?
Cheers and have a great weekend!
I‚Äôve been bugging him about getting some Ben Nevis. He‚Äôs just getting it in. I‚Äôm the first order for it. Herr_Maltenberg Highly recommends it. Good enough for me. Binny‚Äôs had some and it sold out fast. I‚Äôll let you know how it is. There are 3 scotch‚Äôs I‚Äôll buy unseen, Ben Nevis, Clynelish and Tobermory. I‚Äôm looking forward to it.
If only we knew!

You probably know Riley‚Äôs then, near campus. It‚Äôs still the best place around, lots of IBs & oddball malts ‚Äî but yeah, even there‚Äôs not like it was 10 years ago. They used to be just freakin‚Äô LOUSY with high-end Laddies, IB Ardbegs & Laphroaigs, full range of Springbanks, on & on.

Did we used to chat on Connosr too? 

If you ever come up by Madison, hit me up. If our monthly whisky club night is happening, you‚Äôd be very welcome.

-Jason
No idea about Bourbon. :)
Cheers!
I just looked it up.  around $400?
365
Dang, I may have to grab that too, thanks!
Well, it is a bit pricy. There are just a couple of distilleries that I would even consider it. Ben Nevis is one.
I had hoped to pick it up today and let you know how it is but that didn‚Äôt work out. Now Ill have to wait for 2-3 weeks, the next time I‚Äôm down here. If you pick it up, let me know how it is."

Single Malt distilled at Mars Shinshu distillery, this one is aged in a mix of American Oak and sherry casks. Price is up in the $150-$200 range, it is hopefully getting a little older with each release but there's no age statement given. Courtesy of u/Herr_Maltenberg

World Whisky review #25

***************

**Mars Shinshu Komagatake 2020 Limited Edition, 50%**

**Nose:** Some nice meaty body on this stuff. Thick hay malt, butterscotch, vanilla pudding, meaty yet smooth sherry, honey, red fruits, sulfur, baking spice, sweet fruity funk

**Taste:** Smooth meaty malt, hay, caramel, spice, honeyed red fruits, rich fruity wine, some nuttiness, butterscotch, soft baking spice. Nice balance of malt and warm sweet sherry notes, maybe leaning just slightly more to the sherried side. It basically has that same smoothly complex feel like the others, but it has more grit to it. Much thicker mouthfeel and more body to it than the others I tried.

**Finish:** Sweet honeyed fruits, brighter strawberry, a hint of meaty sulfur, hay malt, lightly floral, baking spice. Leaves sweet and malty with some smooth sulfury fruit

***********

Great one to end the series with, easily the best of the bunch. The distillery was apparently mothballed for a long time and was only reopened recently, so the stuff has all been fairly young. This 2020 release hopefully shows that they are increasing the age and quality as they go, rather than just settling on a young smooth (and expensive) Whisky. But as it is, the quality is just unreal for being so young. It's been very interesting to try all these, and it's a distillery who's name I will take notice of in the future even if I don't think I'm quite ready to buy any just yet.

******************

**Mars Shinshu Komagatake 2018 Limited Edition, 48%**

**Nose:** Clean clear caramel, sugary frosting, smooth malt, sweet floral, citrus, musty smoke, light vanilla char. All elegantly smooth and balanced

**Taste:** Drinks crisp and clean, sweet and smoky. Caramel, sweet malt, sugary vanilla frosting, lemon citrus, clean smokiness, vanilla. For being so lightly peated there's a fair amount of smoke here, but lots of smooth malt and bright sweetness still comes through. It all balances very well

**Finish:** Sweet smoke, barley, sugary sweetness, vanilla, some musty wood, light peppery spice. Leaves sweet and smoky with a hint of spice

******************

More really good stuff from this distillery. Like the Nature of Shinshu - Kohiganzakura that I tried before this, it's beautiful in it's simplicity. A smooth and flavorful mouthfeel that is deceivingly complex. Peat is more prevalent than I thought it would be, but it's still more of a light and clean smokiness. I think I slightly preferred the Nature of Shinshu to this one, but that might just be more personal preference than anything else. I'm not always a big fan of lightly peated styles like this. But the smoke is strong enough that you can almost call this a peaty malt but just barely. Makes for an interesting and complex profile

That‚Äôs a grain whisky right? Anyway $200 for a 3 year old whisky is a reminder why buying Japanese whisky is plain not worth it. Can find a hundred bottles at that price point that are vastly superior in flavour. Doesn‚Äôt take much effort to find those hundred bottles even.
You're right, it doesn't actually say single malt I just assumed it was. I still get strong malt and sweet grain type notes from it. 

And yeah I hear you. Price is all relative, whatever people are willing to pay. There's aspects other than age that go into making a quality Whisky. Which is why I think something like Octomore is worth the hefty price even at the young age. This stuff isn't quite up to that level but it is still incredibly impressive
In the end grain and blends can be delicious and I‚Äôm sure this one will be very nice. It‚Äôs just a pity that Japanese whiskies are priced so high so a quite unique bottle as this one just becomes too hard to justify I find considering what you can get for the money.
Looks like I was right the first time, label does say single malt. It's above the Komagatake name I just missed it
And shit look at chichibu.  Ive had ipa cask and the us cask a couple different years and neither of those are worth even $100 to me.  And they are retailed about $300.  Decent stuff but good lord.  Imagine dropping 2k for a 6 year single cask.  Smart stuff!!"

**Nose:** Creamy caramel, baking spice, light butterscotch, cherry, orange caramel, bright citrus, mustiness, sweetly toasted wood, cinnamon. Sweet and bold and bright, delicious nose

**Taste:** Musty wood, bright cherry, creamy caramel, cinnamon, peppery spice kick, some sugary grain type notes, sweetly toasted wood. Maker's Mark often feels youthful and unbalanced to me, this is still in that familiar kind of MM profile but it gets the flavor and mouthfeel right. It's sweet and creamy and bright with a nice Bourbon-y spice kick

**Finish:** Spice and big sweet happy caramel, bold candy cherry that really shines, some creaminess and musty oak. Leaves creamy and spicy and oh so pleasantly sweet

********

Love this stuff. I'm a big fan of Wheaters, so I've always felt like I should be a bigger fan of Maker's Mark than I actually am. But even the cask strength stuff from them has never done much for me. It always feels too rough and youthful to me. But these Wood Finishing series have been great. I loved the 2020 SE4xPR5 and now this one is even better. It still doesn't feel terribly oaky or old, but the sweetness and creaminess and spice kick all balance together better than any other MM I've ever had. Finally a fan of this distillery

If more people tried these limited releases, they would see that good bourbon can be had without having to *hunt* stuff down. The private selects and wood finishing series aren't super hard to find and they taste great!
How would you compare this to the makers 46 cask strength?  I love the 46 cask strength, but never came across one of these.
Not big on Makers usually. FAE-01 was pretty good but I really really liked FAE-02. The lack of chilled filtering makes this one have a very unique texture than typical bourbon. The fatty acids are still in there after filtering so it‚Äôs more viscous and hint of oil behavior. If you‚Äôre looking for it you can see it move around in the bottle and glass differently than a typical bourbon would. So when you sip it, it kind of coats your mouth and sits there for a bit. Since it‚Äôs a great flavor the fact that it sits is great.
I really like FAE-01 and 02. In a blind taste test, FAE-01 won out for me. FAE-01 is my favorite Maker's release I've had.
I like the 46 CS quite a lot, but have not seen FAE-01 or 02. I like the monkey poster in the background even more!
Agreed on how Makers ""standard"" offerings, the cask, 101, always unimpressed me. But these annual offerings and the private selects stave finishing bottles are so good.
Oh I didn't know you found a bottle! Glad to see you enjoy it. My favorite Maker's release yet.
I was a little late on trying to find this one. Other than trying a pour in a bar, it doesn't exist anymore. I wish I could find a place selling this one. Will be on the lookout for the 2022 wood finishing series though this year.
Wellllll looks like people have caught on to Maker‚Äôs limited releases. Didn‚Äôt see any FAE-02 by me and needed a friend to get me a bottle when he found one.
For real, just tried a local place's Makers private selection (Aman's ""Chocolate Covered Cherries"") and was blown away how good it was. Might just be my inexperienced palate, but I actually preferred it to the VW Lot B I tried last year. Granted MSRP for Lot B is pretty much the same as this, but still.
To me, all Maker's Mark has a similar feel. Light wood, lots of sweetness, and lots of heat. So it's similar, but I just think these Wood Finishing Series do it better. It's been quite a while since I had a 46CS though so hard to compare specifically to that one
That's how I feel about these Wood Finishing in general. I've only had two and this one was my favorite, but it's splitting hairs. They are both better than any other Maker's Mark I've had
There is a place near me in KY that has had 2 cases on the floor for almost a month now.  Think it was $65.  You could try them and see if they ship (might be a longshot though).

http://www.happyhourliquorandbar.com/
You might be able to find it‚Ä¶.I found a FAE-01 not too long ago (wanted to compare 01 to 02). Paid $10 over MSRP, but I thought it was worth it considering it had come out so long agoz"

World Whisky review #24

*****************

**Mars Komagatake ""Nature of Shinshu - Kohiganzakura,"" 52%**

**Nose:** Smooth malt, soft cereals, musty, buttery cream, clear bright floral notes, white pepper, a touch of tart berry. So soft and inviting. Malty, touching lightly on the other notes

**Taste:** Continues where the nose left off. Warm smooth malt, wholesome cereal goodness, sweetly floral, light butterscotch, gentle spice, hint of bright berry fruits. After some air time there's a mustiness to it, almost a very gentle peat. It all glides so smoothly over the tongue with a soft and flavorful mouthfeel. It has a balanced kind of complexity, it's so cohesive and elegant yet the more I drink it the more notes I pick up. Very well-done

**Finish:** Bright buttery cream and warm malt builds big, musty, easygoing floral notes, soft sweet cereal and malt lingers with lightly tart fruits and just a little spice

***************

All the flavor you would expect at a lower cask strength of 52% but with almost no heat. It goes down so easy, and it's so delicious making this ridiculously drinkable. And it's a deceivingly well-executed malt. It's so smooth and elegant that it takes some time for the complexity to open up, and you slowly realize how much is going on here. Yet it all stays extremely well-balanced. It's a lot of fun

Yeah this is true Japanese whisky. Milled, mashed, fermented, distilled and matured at Shinshu distillery.  Malting is probably Scottish and the is around 4ppm peated malt in it.  Great review.

It's 3 years old btw.
Oh man that's right! I got swept away by the tasting and totally forgot it said 3 year. This is incredibly impressive for being so young. Easily the best malt I've ever had that is so young"

**Domaine Pouchegu 1978 42 year ""Rare Armagnac Collection"" barrel F10, 49.9%**

**Nose:** Big rich chocolatey oak, woody cherry, smooth dark tannins, savory graham cracker, burnt brown sugar, deep antique wood, vanilla, sweet char, undercurrent of thick chocolatey grape, just a hint of soft wood spice. Everything melds together thickly this epic

**Taste:** Big tannic oak with incredible depth, thick antique wood, sweet toasted cherry wood, balsamic, black cherry, wood spice, tons of vanilla. Amazing complexity, huge flavors that build and flow effortlessly. Has a beautiful tannic and balsamic bite to it but doesn't feel dry or bitter at all. Extremely well balanced by the sweeter toasted notes, vanilla and dark fruits. It all melds together thickly and has an awesome mouthfeel

**Finish:** Rich tannic oak and woody black cherry build huge, still with that incredible depth, wood spice, descends into some balsamic and dark char but still sweetly toasted and big vanilla. A long, intensely woody yet very sweet finish. Huge flavor, amazing and leaves you wanting more

********************

An appropriate way to end this series, this stuff is amazing. This is the Pouchegu I know and love. It has such incredible depth to it, a thick mouthfeel, and at about 50% abv it's still super drinkable. It's the darkest colored of the lot but it's so much more than just a big oak bomb. Lots of delicious stuff going on with a thick oaky backdrop. 

I drank it alongside another 1978 Pouchegu I had, one that I really enjoyed. It's the same age and similar abv. And this K&L one really blows it away. The other 1978 has a noticeably thinner mouthfeel and simpler tannic profile compared to this K&L bottle. This K&L 1978 drinks huge compared to my other one, and it's actually a slightly lower abv. It's so interesting how cask variation can work like that. 

I love this stuff, but I still feel like it's overpriced compared to the other Pouchegus in this lot. It's almost twice the price of the others and only slightly older. But I suppose it's all relative, it certainly won't disappoint and for the age and quality it's still a great price compared to other spirits. I think sometimes you start to pay a premium when it's from a different decade, even when it isn't significantly older

I haven't even opened my bottle but I'm seriously considering getting a backup right now based on your notes. Sounds phenomenal.
Great way to wrap up your Pouchegu flight, I am seriously considering the 78 and 84. If I were to walk away with one it is likely the 84 for the price, but I like how you described the thick mouthfeel of the 78. Decisions decisions‚Ä¶ thanks for the great review.
When are you gonna open yours? Can't wait to hear your thoughts
The 84 just sold out today, so I think your decision was made for you.

the 84 shows 18 in stock in hollywood. you can place a order for will call pick up at whichever store is closest to you.
I'll try to get myself to open it tonight. It's doubtful I will though.
Sonova‚Ä¶ sigh. I was heading out there this Sunday. Well then, 78 it is
[It's back up](https://www.klwines.com/p/i?i=1598062), you're not crazy though it was sold out.
Picked one up, thanks. They are down to 14 now
Next time order online for will call and pick it up later.
Looks like they put up 10 more bottles of the 1984
What happen is sometime they transfer bottles from the main warehouse to one of the three stores and while in transit it's not showing up as in stock.  
Looks like there were 20 bottles that arrived in Hollywood today but were absent from the count yesterday when it sold out.  


Still, it's selling out fast...
Thanks everyone, I placed my order. Not missing out on this one. Who else jumped on one?
I know I'll wait until there's only a few bottles left and fomo buy....

**Taste:** Dark and sweet, dark blackened wood, sweet pop of black cherry, deeply toasted oak, wood spice, rancio, roasted nuttiness, an interesting black licorice note, prune, vanilla, zingy black cherry and spice heat builds brighter. Huge action-packed mouthfeel but without being messy or hot. Dark and oaky and tannic but still very sweet, and lots of spice. The complexity is amazing.

**Finish:** Black cherry, smooth rancio and tannins, dark sweetly-toasted wood, big warm vanilla, zingy cherry and spice. Has a gritty tart darkness to it with just the right balance of rancio and heavy vanilla, leaves minty and fruity and sweetly charred

*************

This one is so interesting. It's huge and amazingly complex, action-packed even. I love it but it's hard to pin down. There's plenty of oak, some dark charred and rancio type notes, and tons of big vibrant sweetness and spice. That big deep Pouchegu oakiness brings it all down to earth and balances it out really well. I went back and forth on this one more than any of the others. I started off not crazy about it, then I did a 180 and thought it was amazing, and now I'm somewhere in between. It's excellent stuff and complex in a way that almost makes it like a chameleon, with different notes emerging stronger depending on the mood. I am really loving the variety of profiles from cask to cask with these Pouchegus. They are all beasts though that's for sure

Curse California shipping laws...

Not even $5/year aged, crazy value when you think about
Nice, this 90 sounds like it was a lot of fun unpacking the nuances of it. I like the cherry and oak notes and am wondering if this is a 7, what the 78 will rank among of the 4. So far, the 84 sounds like I need to run down there before it sells out
Be still my.beating wallet. Nice review! Impatiently awaiting the final of the four
Thanks for the share! I just recently joined r/Brandy and I had no idea about armagnac until I saw your post. Can you please give me an example of something that scores a 1, a 5 and a 10 on your rating system?
Really appreciate the review, thank you. I‚Äôm looking at this bottle as potentially my first toe-dip into brandy. Maybe split it with a fellow whisk(e)y enthusiast. When you said that you started off not being crazy about it, can you remember what it was that left you unimpressed? I‚Äôm looking at this one, as well as K&L‚Äôs 33 year old 1987 Pouchegu.
Why? They won‚Äôt ship outside California?
I think you can find a mule to middle man it for you, but it obviously adds to the expense having to tip them and ship it twice.

Oh man putting me on the spot haha. I dont even know what a 1 would be, never gone that low. But you get the idea just some total rotgut swill. A 5 is a perfectly fine pour, good but nothing special. Maybe Johnnie Walker black? Or makers mark? I dont have a way to go back and check scores so those are off the top of my head. 10 is super rare. For me, 9 is basically a perfect score and 10 is a way to designate something exceptionally special. I've only given out a few 10's. Brora 35 year was a 10

Hope that helps, and welcome to r/Brandy!
Glad you are finding it helpful! I think this is a great one to start with. I get a little nitpicky comparing things sometimes is all. My initial impression was that it felt too dark and closed, kind of muted. But it seemed to open up for me eventually. I should add that even though there is a bottle in the pic, I split this with friends so I only got to try one sample of it. I haven't seen how it might do on multiple tastings or over time. 

If you want some other suggestions to save a little money, K&L has a lot of Pellehaut right now. It's a very solid and reliable Armagnac for a good price. I would stick with any of the late 80's bottles, I've had 88 and 89 stuff that is all consistently good. It's going to be more representative of Armagnac as a style imo, not just a wild dark single cask like the Pouchegu. Baraillon is great too, I heard good things about the 98 but I do think it's naturally low strength. Also they have a ridiculously great price on Cobrafire Evil Force right now. Once you get past the funny name and design it's actually from PM spirits who work with and import a lot of great Armagnac. They really know their stuff. I haven't had it myself but heard great things about it. 

I think whatever you decide on, any of these will be good
Nope, K&L only ships within California

Thanks for the info! I don‚Äôt drink anything but brandy these days so would have to give Johnny Walker a 0 on my rating system. Just joking. I guess a 5 for that seems reasonable. When I lived in Taiwan there was some trash they sold as ‚ÄúFrench Brandy‚Äù that was absolutely disgusting, tasted like it was never aged / ever clear with coloring and maybe a bit of flavoring added to it. Guess that would score a 1 on your rating system.

What are some of the most remarkable brandies you have tried, that you remember? On my own personal quest to fine the ‚Äúbest‚Äù brandy of all time.
Most remarkable? Some of the L'Encantada stuff comes to mind. Especially Le Freche, Lous Pibous, and Del Cassou. Some of the older Pouchegu releases from K&L. The aficianados Grosperrin 1996. Those are all Armagnacs. For Cognac, Jean-Luc Pasquet bottlings. The familie Claude one is one of the best I've had.

Brandy review #101

***********

**Domaine Pouchegu 1984 36 year ""Rare Armagnac Collection"" barrel H10, 56.9%**

**Nose:** Toffee, black cherry, thick sweetly toasted wood, tons of vanilla, sweet candy grape, mint, smooth woody tannins, chocolate. Thick and smooth and woody with a rich vanilla/cherry sweetness and a sweet pop to it. Really fucking nice

**Taste:** Huge rich toasted woodiness, smooth tannins, thick syrupy dark cherry, a thick and woody mouthfeel, graham cracker, toffee, lots of vanilla, and then sweet grape and spice that keeps building bigger and bigger, a nice minty undercurrent. It has that thick dark feel I crave in these but also elements of brasher cherry and spice that explodes on the palate. Very complex and delicious with huge flavor. Wow it's fantastic

**Finish:** Big sweet dark cherry, spice, mint, root beer, bold sweetly toasted wood, vanilla. A huge delicious finish that stretches out for ages

*****************

This one is a zinger. It's huge and incredibly complex. The flavor just explodes. I loved the 1982 but it was very different from previous K&L Pouchegus, much more bold and spicy. This 1984 feels more similar to those older 80/81 K&L bottlings, it has that thick tannic and woody depth to it. But at the same time it incorporates some of the bolder and more vibrant elements of the 82, and combines these profiles perfectly. Between the two I've tried so far this one is easily my favorite

Nice, the 84 edged out the 82. I do enjoy those spicy notes too, but something about when it hits that harmonious balance of wood/spice/fruit/earthy etc. looking forward to the other two reviews.
I drink better then this regularly
After trying unsuccessfully to find a sample I bought one, then it went out of stock, then it came back in stock, and I bought a backup sight unseen based on basically just your review and some nods to Pouchegu being worth a go. Let me tell you......

FUCKING FANTASTIC man. What an impressive product. A finish that just goes on for weeks. I mostly do rum and bourbon and rye with a little mezcal/scotch/tequila and I'm just toe dipping into armagnac and for me this is some of the best stuff I've had. Thankful you got a review in early!
Right on! I try to get reviews of new stuff done quickly, partly to help people make decisions and also because I'm eager to see for myself. So I'm glad you found it helpful"

Brandy review #100

******************

**Domaine Pouchegu 1982 38 year ""Rare Armagnac Collection"" barrel F4, 55.9%**

**Nose:** Toffee, graham cracker, deep rich cherry wood, savory candied pecan kind of nuttiness, smooth tannins, vanilla, cherry, light mint

**Taste:** Blast of syrupy-sweet cherry and spice, thick caramel, big deeply toasted wood, vanilla, peppery spice, candied nuttiness, rich toffee. Hits with a bourbon-y blast of cherry and spice and wood, fills the mouth with big flavor, settles into thicker Armagnac notes of toffee and syrupy fruit sweetness and deeply toasted wood

**Finish:** Thick sweet finish, spice heat sticks around, thick toffee and savory nuttiness, brash cherry and spice, mint. Lingers hot and sweet in a really nice way

**********

I was very curious how this would compare to the 80/81 stuff that K&L has previously bottled, being similar vintage and specs. First impression is that this doesn't have that thick woody and tannic depth of those previous releases. Huge mouthfeel and still very oaky but it's also pretty hot and loud actually. It has a big brash bourbon-y kick to it. You really feel the 55.9%. It's a big sweet spicy Armagnac that delivers tons of bold flavor and never feels overly hot. Love it even if I was kind of hoping for something more like the 80/81's that I love so much

I added a little water to this, and I think it worked out well. Mellowed it out and gave it a little more of that thicker mouthfeel and depth. It watered down the flavor a bit, but might be worth experimenting with some more

Nice, I was looking at the Hontambere 87 before it went out of stock. I need to stop by K&L again, probably in a couple of weeks when my wife is heading out to Hollywood. Congrats on #100!
Been staring at these lately. The K&L folks were saying the 82' had lots of fruit on FB live. Glad that wasn't just pushing product. Looking forward to your next three brandy reviews. Also gratz on 100!!!
87 was overpriced and not as good imo. I think 1982 does it better, at an older age, and cheaper than the 1987
Good to know, thanks! I‚Äôm looking forward to the rest of the bottles, I wonder if the 78 will be similar to the 80/81 for you"

Brandy review #99

**************

**L'Encanatada Domaine Lassalle #102, 1992 28 year, 49.9%**

**Nose:** Dank dark wood, cacao, black cherry, burnt grape, vanilla, some mild minty spice and char. Rich dark and sweet

**Taste:** Bitter tannic oak, dark rancio, dark burnt grape, black cherry, sweet char, vanilla. Flavor is just a bit washed out and thin with a light mouthfeel, and quite a bit of bitterness. I love the dark flavor, there's really good stuff going on with the dark sweetness and rancio but the negatives combine to detract from it a little

**Finish:** Rancio, dark bitter wood, vanilla, black cherry. Dark burnt sweetness and rancio lingers with a touch of vanilla

*******

It's a good dark oaky and rancio-heavy armagnac. There's some bitterness but I can handle that in a dark tannic style like this. The main thing hurting it is the thin mouthfeel. Still enjoyable but one of the weaker Lassalles I've had. Nose is fantastic if only the taste could deliver more.

Sort of refreshing to hear someone say one of their barrels wasn‚Äôt superb.  Given the price on this stuff I‚Äôll be sure to avoid this one. Thanks!!
This cask tasted like disappointment. I couldn't get past the heavy medicinal bitterness that tasted like crushed Tylenol.
Good review, given it‚Äôs a L‚ÄôEncantada offering I almost assumed it would rate higher, but the heavy oak and rancio bomb just sounds overpowering. I wonder if there is a sweet spot of age for wet cellars and when to flip (plus this cellar sounds straight swampy). Also curious what varietal this was. Review 100 for Brandy right around the corner!
What a shame the 90s Lassalles I've had so far have been great. In particular cask #99. Some of the 80s I have had though have been just meh
Glad to hear I wasn't the only one disappointed with this cask. Although it sounds like I maybe enjoyed it just a little bit more than you
Based on trying a number of Lassalles from both l'encantada and Darroze (which are not single cask), I think this particular has flaws not specifically related to how long it has aged. I have heard others say they did not mind the bitterness. I must have been more sensitive to it because to me this cask is not worth drinking. Domaine lassalle was ugni Blanc until 1992. In 1993, the domaine switched to folle Blanche and new oak aging. To differentiate this change, l'encantada used the name Lous Pibous while Darroze continued to bottle under Domaine lassalle. The last vintage distilled was 2005.
Yeah, same. I loved casks #99 and #16. Bought this one blind because it was the highest abv, and it didnt pay off. The 1989 on finedrams wasnt great either, although better than this one I think
The 1989 cask #47 split by Astor wines and sacred thirst (bottled around 2018) is one of my favorites.
Thanks for the info! That is interesting to know about the transition to new oak and folle Blanche, it seems like it was the right move at least for a lot of palates including mine. It doesn‚Äôt need to be bourbon-similar (at least I am trying to branch out to more ‚Äúclassic‚Äù notes), but it does have to be palatable. I am not a fan of heavy bitterness in my pour either so I would not be pursuing this bottle. Too many unknown awesome bottles for incredible prices out there.
Please don't count out lassalle because of this specific cask. Some of them are terrific.
Oh no, of course not. I am pretty much willing to try any Armagnac, preferably vintage as long as the price point allows. The only issue is that Darroze and L‚ÄôEncantada, the two main sources where I have seen a Lassalle bottle are usually more expensive than others, so I would often pursue a different bottle anyways as I am usually trying to a take stab in the dark on bottles. Either way, I have my 95 Lous Pibous #146 and it‚Äôs amazing."
"Review #669: Bertrand Heritage Cognac, 49.2%",,https://i.redd.it/07j0dnn4i9m81.jpg,"From FineDrams: ""This spirit was laid down in the 1960s, with the then head distiller Raymond Bertrand recognised the exceptional quality of the eau-de-vie and its potential for long aging. The spirit itself was distilled from Ugni Blanc grapes grown on the distillery‚Äôs estate. The H√©ritage Cognac was distilled in traditional 800 litre copper pot stills, then still direct fired by wood furnaces. The spirit was then filled into ‚Äúf√ªts roux‚Äù or red barrels ‚Äì which have held several fillings eau-de-vie before ‚Äì resulting in barrels that allow oxidation and evaporation, without overwhelming the Cognac‚Äôs flavours with oak notes over many decades of aging. In such barrels the Cognac has aged for over 50 years, becoming imbued with a deep complexity.""

Brandy review #98

******************

**Bertrand Heritage Cognac, 49.2%**

**Nose:** Graham cracker, toffee, rich wood, vanilla, warm smooth grape, some gentle floral spice, savory caramelized wood type notes, just delicious

**Taste:** Rich antique wood, a touch of dry tobacco, syrupy-thick caramel, brown sugar, sweetly toasted, orange, graham cracker, wood spice, grape candy, light breezy floral notes. Thick mouthfeel with tons of caramelized savory sweetness, rich elegant wood notes, the flavor flows so thick and beautiful

**Finish:** Smooth dry tannins kick in, easygoing tobacco, brown sugar, grape, vanilla, wood spice. Sweet woody and toasted finish

**************

Has an elegance and thick mouthfeel, it's truly a work of art. And just delicious. Just as some notes start to get big and stand out, it smoothly fades back in the whole. Complex in such an elegant and insanely balanced way.

Wow, this sounds extremely well rounded and complex, great review! It‚Äôs exciting how so many unknown bottles are out there that are probably gems. This sounds like it‚Äôs another great bottle to look at.
Sounds amazing and at like sub 5$ per year aged pretty good pricing too
Very tempted to pick up this bottle.
Okay I ordered it.
Anything I‚Äôve had (only scotch/armagnac) over 20 years old is usually overpowered by the wood.  This sounds like the wood was strong but not too much?  Still tastes like brandy not just wood?
One of my absolute favorite pours I've had in recent memory.
Have you had any of the standard Bertrand offerings? There are a few on finedrams.
No this isn't overly woody at all. I've had much younger stuff that comes across way woodier than this. Cognac is good at strategic aging, letting complexity and body build without overpowering everything with the oak. I feel like Scotch can be good at this too actually. Many older Scotches are aged in tired refill barrels so that you still get very grain-driven malts at 20+ years of age. Armagnac can go either way, but there are definitely more cases of oak-soaked armagnacs haha. They seem very willing to celebrate dark dank tannic wood, especially at the 40+ year mark"

American Whiskey review #263

******************

**Elijah Craig Barrel Proof Single Barrel r/Bourbon pick, 9 year 63.7%**

**Nose:** Creamy and nutty, nice mustiness, caramel, butterscotch, corn, toasted wood, menthol spice, sweet cherry. Huge presence but in a thickly balanced and creamy kind of way

**Taste:** Big sweet corn, creamy caramel, bright brash cherry, blast of bright happy spice, sweet toasted wood. Very similar to older ECBP but doesn't have the tannic oak, darker cola, or fiercer spice. It's more creamy and sweet, thickly balanced but with a big explosion of bright cherry and happy spice. So drinkable

**Finish:** Brash cherry and clean bright spice, sweet toasted wood, clean Bourbon-y corn. It's sweet and bright and just enough of a hot kick to remind you that you're drinking ECBP haha

********************

This is a super fun ECBP! I don't know what I was expecting exactly but it wasn't this. It's still very much an ECBP, but compared to the standard 12yr ECBP I think you can taste the slightly younger character and it works really well. It's more creamy and sweet and bright, the oak is there but hasn't quite gotten so old and tannic like the 12yr(I say that with love, I love the 12yr). I actually poured some of my C919 side by side to compare. They are surprisingly similar, the C919 just has an oakier edge, it's darker with much more spice. r/Bourbon is creamier, sweeter, the spice feels bright and happy and it's not such an attack. It's like a crushable ECBP but still hot enough in a fun way to let you know what you're drinking. Great job to the team for picking this one, wish I had been able to get a bottle

Is it just me or does that picture look like something u/t8ke would have uploaded? Thanks for the review!
So cool!  Looking forward to these in the future hopefully!
Nice review, but I'm probably not on the same page as far as these ECBP SPs go. I have found everyone to be underwhelming. 

I even have mixed emotions about being proven wrong. I think, at best, it's going to come from some sort of one and done honey barrel where acquiring a second bottle would be damn near impossible.

At our last baller bottle share soiree, we had a bit of an ECBP extravaganza. I brought in a B517 and a C919 and three different ECBP SPs showed up as well. All the ECBP SPs fell flat. 

Our own ECBP GNS pick is going to be released in the next week and although, at the time of the pick, I thought it was exceptional I don't anticipate it holding up against the 12 yr old batches.

I really wanted these SPs to be better. The oldest one I've tasted so far has been 11 yrs, but it fell short in proof. 

It's come to the point, outside of our own upcoming pick, that I probably won't even bother trying to pick these up anymore.

Also, if you get the chance try to pick up a B517. It was really good and we killed it that night.
When was this released and what was the cost?
Yes, it's actually his picture! I used it with his permission since I only got to try a sample of it for the review
First thing I said. ‚ÄúHey this crook is stealing photos from u/t8ke‚Äù haha
This is the only one of these barrel proof picks I've had, so I cant speak for other ones. I'm here to tell you this one is special though. I have a lot of respect for the team that picked it too, I have no doubt they would have left empty-handed if they didn't find one they liked. 

The profile was a little different from most ECBP's I've had so it's a little hard to compare. But I probably liked it more than any newer bottle design batch of ECBP I've had
Which have you tried, and do you tend to prefer a certain age or proof?
It came out a few months ago, I dont trally remember the price. I think it might have been about $100. But one of these recent picks had an added price to go to a dog charity, if it was this one it might have cost a little more
Thankfully bucky‚Äôs no crook - he‚Äôs one of the best guys I know!
The best of the recent batches of ECBP are the B517 and the C919.

I'm not a fan of these EC BP SPs. They're decent, but not worth the upcharge in price when combined with the reduction in age.
At least you know your photos have a distinctive style which can be hard to pull off.
How many single barrels have you tried? I tend to agree, especially for the middling proof of many, but I've had a decent handful of hazmat/Deatsville barrels which have been outstanding.
I love that!
I've now tried about a half dozen and none I thought were better than their batched 12 yr old releases. Hope springs eternal.
I‚Äôve had a few that I thought were more fruity than the batched stuff, and better mouthfeels from higher proofs (139-141) but I‚Äôve also had some that were mehhhhh. We picked a Deatsville a little bit ago which will be arriving in a month or two we think, but the other two barrels they offered were definitely substantially less interesting. I imagine proof plays a huge role in these picks.
Our SP is dropping any day now. I'm hoping for good things.

**************

**Grosperrin Cognac Bons Bois 1992 lot no. 679, 51.5%**

**Nose:** Butterscotch, sweet floral caramel, some richer toffee creeps in, holiday spice, sandalwood with smooth wood spice, vanilla, sweet berries. A very nice sweet and easygoing nose with just a hint of richer toffee backbone to it, smoothly balanced

**Taste:** Smooth dry oak, cherry wood, aromatic wood spice, sandalwood, caramel, sweet smooth berry, soft grape, butterscotch. Has a delicious complex woody character to it that smoothly shifts while staying well-balanced. Feels creamy and sweet with just the right amount of dry aromatic woodiness

**Finish:** Tart berry builds brighter, woody caramel, butterscotch, smooth dry wood, some mild peppery spice, sweet cherry wood, vanilla.

**************

It sits somewhere between creamy/rich and delicate, it has some aspects of both in the taste and mouthfeel. Complex and extremely well-balanced. So far in my experience, Grosperrin can do no wrong. This is one of the weaker ones I've had probably but it's still thoroughly enjoyable and I have no regrets at the price

Review #666: Octomore 8.2,,https://i.redd.it/91cinzk0ynk81.jpg,"For review #666 I wanted to do something special. This one seemed fitting, since these black Octo bottles always had kind of an evil Heavy Metal look to me. This 8.2 edition is 8 years old, and was aged in a combination of French Mourvedre, Austrian sweet wine, and French Sauternes casks. Purchased for about $130.

Scotch review #277

**************

**Octomore 8.2, 58.4%**

**Nose:** Thick, intense, sludgy peat. Such a big powerful clean smokiness to it, salted pork, sharp bubbly wine, tart berry, burnt rubber, anise, a sharp almost metallic wine quality, vanilla cream, brine. The huge peat is layered softly over all of it

**Taste:** Big bright wine sweetness, black cherry, bubbly sweet berries, thick yet surprisingly clean peat that builds, smoky bbq, barley sugar, vanilla cream, sweet barrel char, black licorice, caramel, sea brine, charred oak. Trademark huge Octomore mouthfeel, with sludgy peat and big wine sweetness it's somehow nimble and complex yet thickly balanced at the same time. Like layers of flavor with that huge soft peat permeating it all.

**Finish:** Heavy charred peat and vanilla, robust cereal malt breaks through all the huge notes, balanced fruity wine sweetness. Charred sludgy peat, vanilla, and sweet berry wine lingers

***************

You can always count on Octomore to deliver. The last bottle I went through was 7.2, and it was good but might have been my least favorite Octo I've had. The wine sweetness was sickly-sweet and a bit unbalanced. This one has plenty of wine influence but it never takes over. It brings back more of the savory bbq meat, charred oak and vanilla type Islay influence. The longer I sit with it the more it offers, this stuff is just so complex yet insanely thick and peaty. There is simply nothing else out there like this stuff. Another amazing Octomore

167 ppm peat. Love seeing that.
I‚Äôm looking to get an octomore. Any suggestions on what I should try to get. Port charlotte and all ardbegs are my go too. Thanks
Sounds delish.  Great review as always. $130? Those were the days
Oh you lucky bastard.  I want a bottle to try.  O AO
Oh shoot, I haven't seen that monkey poster in close to 15 years but it was hanging on my dorm room wall for for four years of college! Memories!
I love this bottle. When I first opened it I wasn't sure. I thought it was great but didn't stack up to the 7.3 or 6.1. now I think this is easily right behind the 7.3 in terms of my favorite Octomore. It is huge and flavorful and reminds me a lot of the Port Charlotte MRC:01 with an extra Octomore oomph. Great review! And great choice for the number of the beast.
Thanks for this review, as always. This just sounds delicious! Review #666...that is impressive. And to think I had the opportunity to grab a 7.3 and didn't. What a lost opportunity.
Great review, and I agree on this one being better than 7.2!! There don't seem to be a whole lot of other people with that opinion though... But hey, if that means this one stays cheaper, I'll take it.
If you are a fan of peat, you really can't go wrong with any Octomore. I think the .3's tend to be the best but really they are all fantastic. I haven't had much of the later editions after 9 or 10 so I can't speak for any specific bottlings from those runs
Get a 7.3 before they go extinct. It's worth paying for. After that I'd go 10.3 and then whatever the latest most readily available .3 is for you. I love em.
Right? And we all thought that was high for a 6 year Scotch back then
Dont worry octomore is still pretty special stuff. Just sucks it's gotten so expensive
Thanks I‚Äôm buying one this weekend and my local store has 4 different ones on hand
Update they have the 10.1 11.1 and 11.3
Awesome thanks I‚Äôll let you all know which ones are there today
Also why not any of the .1 or .2
To be fair it still is if just going on age
Yup and not that long ago.
Do you remember which 4 they have?
11.3 would be my pick!
Nothing wrong with any of those, if you're pickup up a set go for it and you'll see how each finish changes the expression! I advise the .3's because in my experience they're the best. Some people swear by the .2's - if you like more wine influence maybe start there!

**************

**Nashville Barrel Company Rye 8 year (MGP), Orange County Bourbon Society/Cypress Liquor, 54.45%**

**Nose:** Minty rye, big herbal notes, coffee, dark toasted oak, banana funk, cherry, peppery and herbal spice. The herbal notes and darker coffee gives it a really nice savory feel, an interesting and yummy nose

**Taste:** Toasted oak and coffee, graham cracker, builds to hot spice and herbal notes, zingy cinnamon, green rye grain, caramel, mint, sweet vanilla and cherry, hot herbal spice. Herbal and spicy and zingy, and it's good with the darker savory wood notes and sweetness that comes in. Brash but with some flavor to back it up

**Finish:** Cinnamon, herbal spice, sharp rye grain, cherry and mint, caramel wood, zingy spice, some lingering funk and herbal notes.

******************

Big flavor with lots of complexity and brash Rye action going on. It's a bit more herbal than I usually like, but I think everything works together really well. Especially some of the nice savory wood notes. I'm a big fan of MGP Rye so I tend to get a little nitpicky on these. Not one of my favorite barrels maybe, but it's thoroughly enjoyable. And it's still a notch above lots of other cask strength MGP rye out there. NBC continues to have some interesting stock, and these guys picked a fun barrel

Awesome review. Enjoying the Nulu Toasted Rye.  When my buddy comes to visit he brings some really solid Cypress picks. I really enjoy them.
Ha its just a fun and easy little angle in my house that caught on. Glad you like it haha. Agreed, I've had quite a few of these now and they tend to be quite good. This one is probably the lower end and it's still a great rye. It was so hard to get good barrel proof MGP rye for so long, so I'm glad these are around more and more"
My latest cork casualty. Does anyone else have a problem with corks shrinking and becoming unusable?,,https://i.redd.it/wygpjtffx2j81.jpg,"Only in the pool
I don‚Äôt usually have an issue, almost never. But, I did buy one of those JDSBBP and the first thing I noticed was the cork was not tight at all, from the beginning
Once with a bottle of Bulleit that sat around for a while, but not any other bottle I‚Äôve had
It happens if you have the bottle in a cool place. The cork hydrates with the natural fluctuation of temperature. That temperature change produces vapor inside the bottle (greenhouse effect) which rises up and hydrates the cork.

To reanimate a dried out cork you can do a couple of things, the easiest is to seal the bottle with a vapor barrier such as parafilm then wait a couple of days
I have this happen from time to time, I keep extra bottle tops in a box for this reason. Once in a while I will tip an older bottle back and forth to wet the cork, not sure if it works or just makes me feel better. Lol
I have an OGD 114 that you can basically drop the cork in.  Didn't even make a sound when I opened it for the first time.  Promptly replaced.
Always with old elk bottles!
More more over the last few years I've been having trouble with corks shrinking and becoming loose in the neck. I will notice a cork feels just slightly loose and easy to pull, and invariably once it has reached this point it will continue to shrink and get worse until the cork is completely useless. This Jack Daniels cork has shrunk so badly that I can literally just drop it into the neck and it falls right in. Surely a cork shouldn't be able to shrink to that extent even when dry?!?! What the fuck is going on with these corks? I live in a very dry area granted, but in many years of drinking I never had this problem until fairly recently. Like the last year or two. Anyone else experiencing this?
Never had a problem. A bottle usually lasts me about 2 weeks so not really a lot of time to shrink
My JD SiB Rye has a loose cork.
I was going to ask if you lived in a dry climate. Yeah corms shrink alot when dried. I wonder if you can soak it in water
Save your old good corks and drink more! Cheers!
Is one supposed to occasionally tip whiskey bottles to wet the cork?
Splash a little bourbon in it, (like a small shake or something) that usually works for me.
This used to be a really big problem with the old style Elijah Craig bottles. I guess the solution is just to drink it faster.
My only shrinking cork has been crown royal rye 16yr
I just noticed a cork on one of my most expensive bottles was loose. I turned it upside down (while holding it) and whiskey came out!!! No bueno.

I went through my cabinet until I found a cork that fit snuggly.   Guess I'll be drinking the Makers Mark Private Select until it's gone since I put the crappy cork in it!
There was significant shrinkage
Frightened turtle syndrome
Yep, has happened with one of my JDSBBP too. Had to use a wine stopper
I keep all my old corks too luckily so I am usually able to find a backup. And yeah I've tried briefly tipping bottles back and forth just to wet the cork, and it doesn't help
You must have had an old 114 cork because that cork is a behemoth
I haven't tried that, it couldn't hurt. I will think I will try soaking this one and see if it becomes usable again as an experiment. Thanks for the suggestion!

[Obligatory cork soaker sketch from SNL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deqx-Xb-yHY)
A few here have mentioned it, but it's not something I've ever heard of people doing. I wouldn't worry about it as my problem of corks drying out seems to be unique
IT WAS COLD!
They tend to shrink in the water.
The 114 cork is the chode of the bourbon world
As soon as I saw this post I knew you were a real cork soaker. Let us know how it works
I don‚Äôt recall reading how you stored it, but;

Wine people keep the bottles on their side to mitigate this problem. Could be a solution.
That whole bottle design and label is just trash. It's so ugly, it looks like a malt liquor 40oz from the 90's and it's a drippy bottle.
This is how you get cork rot and ruin a whiskey. alcohol is a solvent and will dissolve cork.
You should never store spirits on their side. It works for wine because of the lower abv, but corks cant stand up to the higher alcohol content of spirits. It will dissolve and ruin the cork
I know of collectors who rotate (tip) their bottles to keep the corks moist.
Yep. Marketing team should be fired for that trash bottle
Personally I'm a fan of the throwback look.  Any label design that's been around for decades is fun.  If they do a redesign it's guaranteed to both end up looking worse and go up in price by $10.
I didn‚Äôt know that! Thank you for educating me.
[deleted]
The bottle has always been the same and there is nothing throwback about the new labeling. The standard OGD and OGD BiB have the old timey orange labeling and 114 used to have the same to keep in line. Now it looks like a German art student redesigned it in 1993.
That's how I feel about this sub and mellow corn.
Oh I like the whiskey. The bottle itself is shit.
I love OGD 114 but the whole bottle and label are awful. I don't understand why it doesn't look more like OGD standard and OGD Bonded, but whatever.
I love the juice, just not the bottle.
Mellow Corn is good whiskey for what it is. I also love the label."

Not technically allowed to be called Armagnac anymore so it's sold as a brandy. Consists of Belair 1989, Del Cassou 1985, Lasalle 1992, Del Cassou 1993, and Del Cassou 1994. These were blended together and then aged for 6 months in Weller Bourbon barrels.

Brandy review #96

*****************

**L'Encantada Tattoo series 1 batch 2 Brandy, 47.6%**

**Nose:** Rich fruits, grape and cherry, tons and tons of vanilla, warm smooth toasted wood, toasted marshmallow, caramel, chocolate, nice smooth vanilla char. Delicious and super inviting

**Taste:** Dark caramel and smooth mildly tannic wood, vanilla, understated grape emerges and builds sweeter, tart cherry, some peppery dry wood spice. A hint of zingy corn in there with the spice. It's tasty but dark and somewhat muted compared to the wonderful nose. Tons of smooth dark wood and big sweet vanilla

**Finish:** Sweet candy cherry, big vanilla, light spice, smooth tannic wood, woody caramel, sweet grape, maybe just a hint of zingy corn and spice in there again. Lots of vanilla and grape lingers

*******************

Delicious kind of smooth woody and fruity yak. Very well balanced. If there's any kind of major influence going on here it's tons of sweet vanilla, more than I'm used to in a yak. Integrates really well. Has a nice smooth wood sweetness to it. Overall it's very smoothly balanced, never feels too sweet or too spicy or too woody at all. It's also not a ""Bourbon-y"" kind of Armagnac like I thought it might be, stuff like Pibous still holds that record. Just a nice smooth vanilla-heavy Armagnac

The 1972 was bottled in 2013 making it about 41 years old. No idea when the 1979 was bottled, so the age is a bit of a mystery but I'm guessing it's in the 30-40 year range. Courtesy of u/Stefan__1985

Brandy reviews #94 & 95

**************

**Lasgraves 1972, 46%**

**Nose:** Dark syrupy grape, toffee, plum, dark toasted wood, thick vanilla, mint, soft spice, smooth tannic wood. Darkly sweet, fruity, and dense nose. Really freaking good

**Taste:** Big fruity grape and smooth tannic wood, caramel, sweetly toasted, vanilla, black cherry. Bold fruits, dark sweet wood with just a hint of tannic bite. Dense flavor all melds together beautifully

**Finish:** smooth dry tannins build with some wood spice, flows smoothly into big bold fruity grape and caramel, dark wood and light balsamic. The dense flavor from the palate just keeps flowing into the finish. Really nice all the way through to the end

****************

**Lasgraves 1979, 46%**

**Nose:** Dark syrupy grape, sweet black cherry, plum, caramel, deep dark stewed fruits, balsamic, dark wood, vanilla. Tannins and dark balsamic is absorbed by all the thick dark fruits and vanilla, very dense

**Taste:** Dry tannic wood, vanilla, smooth woodiness, sweet tart grape that pops, cherry, dark balsamic. The wood on this is beautiful, it somehow ranges from vanilla and darkly toasted and sweet to mouth-puckering tannic dryness. It all melds with the dark sweet fruits it just tastes so old but in a smooth densely packed way. Really nice

**Finish:** Beautiful woody finish, very complex yet flows smoothly. Rich tannic wood, vanilla, bold sweet grape, sweetly toasted and tannic and dark fruits.

***************

Both of these are smooth rich Armagnacs with densely packed flavor. Bold fruits and complex dark wood notes that all melds together. The 1972 has bolder fruits and caramel and is a little sweeter. 1979 has more balsamic and drier wood notes, but still some beautiful bold fruitiness to it. 1979 is even slightly darker in color, but just barely. They are different enough to each have their own appeal. But overall the 1972 feels a little richer, fuller, and more complex with a much better finish. 79 is still a wonderful darker wood Armagnac. 

Neither of these really remind me of Encantada Le Freche, except for maybe the delicious boldness of the fruits. I think of Le Freche as having a little bit brighter fruits, brasher wood, and more punchy overall. But it's a hard comparison to make since these are lower abv and higher in age(Although I don't actually know the age of the 79, it could be closer to the 30 year mark like Encantada Le Freche tends to be). All I know is that I seem to love Le Freche in any form.

Great review my friend and yes they are lovely :)
Where does one find a 72 Lasgraves?
Great review(s), I am interested in the typical characteristics that you would expect in the Le Freche bottlings. They sound very ‚Äúfull‚Äù and multi dimensional. I will need to be on the lookout for lasgraves and le freche for my next bottle (difficult to find).
This is an older bottling that I got to try from a friend in Europe. I dont know where you would find these now, but if you find out let me know!"

American Whiskey review #261

***************

**Cadenhead's Heaven Hill 10 year, 66.4%**

**Nose:** Butterscotch, maple, buttery wood, sweet and creamy, corn, just a hint of minty spice to keep it from being too smooth. Still, it doesn't nose very much like a Bourbon at all. And definitely not a 64% one. It's almost Scotchy in it's creamy sweetness.

**Taste:** Big sweet corn, sugary frosting, cinnamon cherry candy, peppery spice, clean sweetly toasted wood, mint. It's a really interesting combo of sweet and creamy with a nice little Bourbon spice kick. Even with the spice this doesn't drink anywhere near 66% though, it's more of a balancing spice than any kind of burn. It still has that creamy-sweet Scotchy quality like the nose, but with more corn and spice kick coming through 

**Finish:** Fruity cherry, mint and spice build brightly. Descends into more tart fruits and heavy spice layer. A fruity sweet and spicy finish but still not very oaky

***************

Wow this is interesting and tasty stuff. It's like a Scotchy Bourbon. Butterscotch and maple and creamy sweetness, with some corn and Bourbon spice. I was wondering if it was maybe just the Scotch label throwing me off, so I poured another high proof well-aged Heaven Hill to compare: ECBP batch C919. Right away the ECBP is much darker in color. And sure enough the ECBP is oaky and fierce compared to this lighter and creamier Heaven Hill stuff. This Cadenhead's doesn't even really have oak like how you would normally think of ""oak"" in a Bourbon. I don't know what's going on, it's labelled as Bourbon but it drinks more like some kind of refill barrel. Maybe it's just aged in Scotland, and this is the effects of the different climate? Whatever it is, it works well and is very unique and fun.

Wood Type................................................ Barrel

Now that's just funny.
It's always interesting to see a bourbon aged somewhere with mild weather, sea air, and dunnage warehouses. An american spirit with a nice, slow, cool maturation can have sone really unique character.
This is really cool, thanks. I like how ‚ÄúAmerica Bourbon‚Äù is meant to signify that the ‚Äúwhisky of the world‚Äù for America is bourbon, and not that this is, bourbon. EDIT: Or is it technically bourbon if HH distilled it?
I have simple rules: I see Cadenheads releasing a bourbon, I jump at it. Best bourbon I ever had came from one of these casks
It was bourbon the second it came off the still and went into oak. Yes, definitely is a bourbon.
It's technically straight bourbon if it's made in the US, has a mashbill, has over 50% corn in the mashbill, is aged in new white oak barrels for no less than two years, and is no more than 62.5% abv when entering the barrel. It's not like it's an exact recipe for success, but those are the limitations that were put in place in order to differentiate it from other whiskeys and build a reputation.

I would personally love to see more freedom and experimentation with it, but then you have something with the dubious moniker of ""american whiskey."" They're painfully hard to market effectively, so they're not as common as I would like to see. The abv limitation can be circumvented somewhat, but then you get an even worse category of ""american *blended* whiskey"" which is shared with wonderful products like Old Thompson's drain cleaner. So it's a hard category to get any respect in."

Scotch review #276

**************

**Strathisla 2010 9 year Hart Brothers, 1st fill Armagnac butt 53.8%**

**Nose:** Butterscotch, caramel, smooth wood, tart red fruits, bready malt, some nice spice. It's mostly very Scotchy with just a little extra twang of tart fruits and spice. Comes together smoothly and cohesively, really good nose

**Taste:** Right away it arrives sharp and tart with big green apple and tart berry, smooths out into sugary frosting, caramel, buttery wood, bready malt, a nice little spice kick. Feels sweet and malty with a fun little twang of tart fruits and spice, it all balances together together well

**Finish:** Smooth spice, caramel, green apple, it's sugary sweet and tart but in a smooth Scotch-y way still, lingering green apple and spice 

******************

Wasn't sure what to expect from an Armagnac cask aged Scotch, it's pretty fun and unique stuff. It's Scotchy but with a very interesting tart berry and green apple twang to it. The tart fruits have a fairly big presence but don't feel intrusive. It could be a little thicker and bolder overall maybe, but it's thoroughly enjoyable. Worth every penny of the $60 it went for

$60, what a steal. Great review. Though it does sound a bit strange.
You don't see alot of Strathisla single malt period, but I recently found an old Cheiftains about the same age in a plain ex-bourbon cask.  It surprised me to find some similar butterscotch and red fruit notes which I usually find in vattings that include a small amount of sherry casks, but without the tart notes you're finding here.  I've found some old mentions placed Strathisla as a solid competitor to Macallan, but Pernod-Ricard uses this malt as a backbone in many of their blends making it even more rare than Longmorn to find as a single malt.  This sounds really cool.
Yea, I‚Äôd be all over that.
Love Armagnac and always wanted to try a refill cask of it with scotch. Sounds punchy!
Yeah K&L has been killing it with these Hart Brothers bottles ever since 700ml were approved for the U.S."

So I thought it would be fun to do a small test of pitting my batch 8 against a sample of something more recent. I got a sample of batch 15 and reviewed them blind side-by-side, with a reveal at the end. Small sample size so maybe not definitive but fun to do.

American Whiskey review #259 & 260

************

**Sample 1**

**Nose:** Toasted oak, tannic and brash, vanilla, tobacco, nose-tingling spice, cherry cola, graham cracker. It's hot and powerful with some nice rich wood notes

**Taste:** Huge blast of flavor, big hot cherry, zingy peppery spice, dry tannic wood, menthol, cherry cola, sweet brash corn, big blast of sweet toasted oak, tons of complex spice heat. It blasts the palate with lots of big powerful spice and brash flavor

**Finish:** After the more zingy sweet and hot palate the deeper oak notes really come out on the finish. Sweet spice slowly gets richer and darker with chocolate and tannins, sweet toasted oak, lingering cherry and spice. Vewry long finish

*************************

**Sample 2**

**Nose:** Sweet toasted oak, funky corn, herbal notes and peppery spice, significant heat, caramel, cherry cola, mild young funk. Nice but feels a little thin and hot compared to #1

**Taste:** Blast of big hot spice, cherry cola, brash and peppery, big sweet corn, brash toasted wood, caramel. So much hot spice and cherry that really blasts the palate in a fun way

**Finish:** Hot burning spice and cherry, mint, wood notes of toasted oak, caramel and root beer, long finish that lingers with lots of cherry sweetness and tingly spice

*******************

I was really wondering how similar these might or if there would be any major differences. And it turns out one definitely drinks better than the other. 1 is the clear winner for me. The oak is deeper with more vanilla and tannis, the cherry sweetness is richer. Both are hot hot hot but 1 feels much better balanced by bigger oak and fuller flavor. 

2 feels more hot and thin overall. The big blast of spice heat is more center stage, the flavor feels washed out and there's not as much oak. There's a noticeable hint of youthful corn funk. It feels like a hotter and less satisfying version of 1. 

Both are good and have that same big brash slap in the face feel that is a lot of fun, but the bigger oak notes on 1 really elevates it.

*************

**Post-Reveal Thoughts:** Well dang, I was afraid this would happen. I was really hoping that the one that I still have half a bottle of would be the winner lol. Kind of a fun result in that it goes to show that older does NOT always equal better. Stagg jr batch 6 was my first barrel proof bourbon and those old batches will always hold a special place in my heart. But if batch 15 is representative of how these newer ones are then they have really come along since then. I think it was good to do blind, I might have been looking harder for redeeming qualities in the bottle I have instead of letting the results speak for themselves
Stagg Jr batches 1-8 were all gasoline to me. They really dialed it in since then
Menthol seemed to be a clue in your review.

Comparatively, there was a profile change after 11, with many newer ones being simpler and less oak/cherry with an increase in brown sugar.
So encouraging to see at least one of the great storied distillers responding to exponentially increased demand with increased quality.

Kind of the opposite of the other king of the great value-priced cask strength bourbons, Elijah Craig BP. Still very good, and a relative bargain, but they kind of all drink the same now, and nowhere near the old dark sweet oaky magic of those nostalgic early 2016 and earlier bottles, before the batch numbering.

My favorite of the Stagg Jr. bottlings has been Batch 13. They‚Äôre all so good now, though.
Fantastic review! 15 is my favorite batch since the revered 12. I had to bunker 3 in trades, but seems like I might be in the minority of loving that batch so much.

**Taste:** Creamy caramel, big warm wood spice, rich and sweetly toasted, Just a touch of drier tannic oak to balnce out the sweetness, light root beer, tart grape, sweet candy cherry, minty spice. Lots of woody caramel type flavor, big spice warmth, and very sweet from the caramel and fruits. Very cohesive and smooth despite it's big bold flavors and spice

**Finish:** Caramel, strong layer of smooth wood spice, sweet cherry and toasted wood. lingering caramel-toasted wood, spice and cherry

I enjoyed these all a lot. I really hope these are all Rye becasue they really drank like Rye to me. 1 was my least favorite but still quite tasty. I'm gonna guess it's the youngest, and a brash 55-60%.

2 and 3 are both fantastic and in a slightly higher league than 1. They both had big flavor that really popped clean and bright, 2 did it a little more thick and balanced and 3 was more bright and complex. I think they are evenly matched but for my tastes I liked 2 better

I hate to randomly guess, but just for fun here are more of my TOTALLY wild guesses: I'm gonna say 2 is the oldest at 8-10 year with a balanced 55-60%, and 3 was in the 7-8 year range and a more sensible 55%. I think they are MGP, but I did briefly think 2 might have been a WhistlePig

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** Oh dang, I cant believe I went all in on rye. I really had myself convinced it was rye. I even had a moment where I asked myself ""what if these aren't rye?"" But I still felt secure that they were. This is not the first time that I confused Four Roses for a rye in a blind tasting so I suppose it's not the worst thing, but the reveal was still a big ""oof"" moment for me. At any rate the quality still really shone through in these, the 2019 and 2021 were just incredible. 2015 was surprising, I might have rated it a little higher if I had known what I was drinking so it was a good one to do blind. It did not stack up to the quality of these more recent releases
We do a lot of blinds in our whiskey group and I have an insanely hard time with 4Rs. They fall so far outside of the spectrum of the rest of the KSBs quite a few of us will mix them up with barely legal ryes. Love the reviews and agree on 2019 4R, the best of the SmBs I‚Äôve had going back to 2013.
Thanks for posting my friend :)
I can spot a four roses a mile away in a blind I think because I‚Äôve drank them so often at one point. I would struggle here though where it‚Äôs all four roses so your guess on ryes makes complete sense to me.
Fantastic review and a humbling experience that I‚Äôve felt before on a blind review like this. I don‚Äôt know about you, but sometimes I will just get this thought in my head a about what I‚Äôm drinking and my mind will just go down a rabbit hole in the wrong direction. However as you noted about having similar thoughts on past Four Roses tasting like rye, I‚Äôve had similar experiences too so you‚Äôre not alone with that. Though man that 2019 is fantastic almost finished mine! Cheers awesome review!
Lol. You never know when you‚Äôre doing blind sample reviews do you? I saw you post about doing this and being convinced it was 3 ryes. I‚Äôm sad about the 2015 placing last as that is one of my favorite all time bourbons. Great sbs reviews though!
Awesome tasting and thanks posting! Four Roses is pretty high rye for a bourbon and MGP shares a history with Four Roses, so I actually think your guesses weren't totally off. And yeah, the 2019 LE SmB is one of the best releases of recent years.
Shout out to the Dynavap off screen
Kudos to you for still posting this review. And it was enjoyable to read, too. Eye opening that 2015 did not perform well against these two. Credit to Brent then as folks were concerned he may not be able to hold up to Jim's legacy.
Great review
Yea I sometimes drink four roses picks knowingly and swear it's a rye. 
They can really bring out a spicy and herbal character befitting of rye whiskeys.
Loved your review and honesty!!! Cheers to you. My plan is to keep drinking till I never make a mistake! Hahaha
Since I finally found a couple of EHT BP this is probably my current unicorn.
You are living my best life
Heh, I knew immediately from your notes which one was the 2019.  What a banger.
Tremendous review. 

Just cracked a '17 and a '20. Love this stuff, but there is definitely a difference from year to year. Loved the '21.

The '20 is definitely better than the '17.
That 2015 looks like it may have been open and mostly empty for a while, and if so it really isn't a fair comparison because the whiskey will definitely be compromised by sitting around for years in a bottle with a lot of air in it.  Could explain why it performed so much worse than the other 2 for you.
Blinds= truth. honest read (no reveal) destined that '19 \*had to be\* glass #2.  Most of us get off the chart juicy fruit and red fruits. The surprise is that you still picked up mint there.. Totally agree that 4R can throw us off.  Thanks for sharing!
Same here I love the 2019 :)
Recently did 2015 through 2021 and 2019 was a consensus favorite.
:D
Yes that's exactly what happens and probably what happened here. You get an idea in your mind of what something is, and you start looking for those notes. And it didn't help that these are an especially rye-heavy and spicey Bourbon. Sometimes you nail a blind and feel like a badass, and sometimes you get humbled haha like you said. It's always fun though. Cheers, and thanks!
Yes haha that was just the other night. I have really enjoyed the 2015 in the past too, but I can't really argue with blind results
I did a FRLE side by side series a few years ago of 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. And interestingly, the 2015 was one of my favorites in that series and I gave it 9/10. So it's still a fantastic Bourbon. It might have suffered a little being compared to two others that I liked more. Might have done better drank on it's own
I‚Äôve had a few reg SiB (50%) bottles that I SWEAR are ryes the way they express
Thanks, cheers! Good luck with that haha
I drank way through whole bottle of '17 (lucky me) but it never hit as well as other releases.. So much spice, it threw me. Palate often struggled to pick up the DEEP FLAVORS evident in the other yrs.  others compare if to '20 in regard to the spice bomb though.. i am more a fruity guy it seems
Actually they aren't in order on the picture, the mostly empty one on the far left is the 2019! The 2015 is almost completely full, not sure how long it's been open though
It changes the whiskey but not always for the worse.  I have had some bottles that get a bit boring with a lot of air time and others that just settle into a better spot.
Came here to say this.
Good to know, thanks for the clarity!  I wouldn't think the 2015 being open even for 6 or 7 years would matter much then since it is mostly full, but I'm not sure!  I recently finished off a bottle of Glenfiddich 15y that I'd had open for 11 years!  It was still delicious.  So I'm going to say there's a good chance the 2015 just plain wasn't as good as the newer ones in your blind taste.  Thanks for the review!
The 2015 is open for like 12 month, so no issues :)"
"Review #653: W.B. Saffell Bourbon, 53.5%",,https://i.redd.it/tk156sjgsyd81.jpg,"Made by Wild Turkey, this pays tribute to William Butler Saffell who began distilling as a teenager and built his first distillery in 1889. A blend of 6, 8, 10, and 12-year-old Kentucky straight bourbons, it's non-chill filtered and bottled at 107 proof. The distillate is all made at Wild Turkey in Lawrenceberg, KY with their 75% corn, 13% rye, and 12% malted barley mashbill. About $50 for a 375ml bottle. Courtesy of u/Stefan__1985

American Whiskey review #255

**********

**W.B. Saffell Bourbon, 53.5%**

**Nose:** Big musty wood, caramel, smooth pleasant funk, corn, some berry fruits, vanilla, clove spice. Musty and sweet, nice Bourbon-y Turkey nose

**Taste:** Brown sugar and woody caramel, sweet corn, light Turkey funk, cherry, vanilla, big clove and spice builds to a decent peppery spice kick with hot cherry, mild tobacco and tannic wood. Nice wood action here, plenty of big Boourbon-y sweetness, and a decent spice kick to it. A really fun little Bourbon.

**Finish:** Sweet brown sugar and caramel, the peppery spice kick calms down into a thick layer of clove spice and brash syrupy-sweet corn that rides out nicely

***********

I dig this stuff. I like the traditional musty Turkey nose but then it's more sweet and spicy Bourbon on the Palate. It's nice at the 53.5% abv, it drinks somewhere in between a smooth 101 proof Turkey and a full-on barrel proof bruiser. Like ""diet barrel proof."" It's a little bit of a different take on the Turkey profile, hotter and sweeter. Having tried it now, I don't think it's quite worth the premium price. But I wouldn't regret purchasing it

Score: **7**

Different palates I guess.  I fell in love and bought 7 bottles for about $42 a pop.  I think I am going to make a necklace with the toppers.
$100 for wild turkey seems high until you put it next to masters keep and realize its a better pour for half the price.
This is the only standout in the Whiskey Baron collection. It's damn good stuff.

We recently had Bruce Russell come into our bottle share group and talk. It was a super cool event. He mentioned what a disappointment Old Ripy was. Lol
Are the bottles on the shelves now leftovers from the 2019 release or are there continuing new batches being released?  Thx.
I really dig Saffell. I have a number of RR SiB - all are good, Saffell is a cut above.

&#x200B;

And while I dig the Master Keeps I've tried, I agree with comments that Saffell holds up to MK at a fraction of the cost.

  
I have one bottle left of Saffell and will grab more if/when it resurfaces in my area
Agreed.  I love this shit.  I've been through something like four bottles of it at this point.
Haha I bought three when I finally found it and hadn't even tried it yet. Just had a feeling I needed to buy more than just one and so glad I did. $50 a pop here so not the biggest fan of the price, but definitely one I keep stocked.
That probably depends a lot on which Master's Keep, some have been underwhelming but some have been awesome
It also seems less high when you consider that it's better than a lot of bottles from other distilleries that cost as much or more.
By the same token you can get a RR pick for ~$65 for a 750 ml at 3 proof points higher. In my experience the RR picks I‚Äôve had are on par or better than the Saffell.
The Old Ripy is the only bottle from The Whiskey Barron's that I've tasted. Definitely felt like a mistake at $55 for a 375ml bottle.
There was only the one batch I believe, so anything on the shelf is older from this same release a few years ago
New ones that are mislabeled batch 1.
Not sure but I picked one up a week ago in Wisconsin and had never seen/heard of it before. Had to do a google search and saw it was a WT product. There has been more talk of this on Reddit/FB in the last week or so so maybe there was a new drop of held back supply or something?
You aren't wrong at all on the first part.

For me, Russell's is a step down. But I'm not huge into the Russell SiB profile for some reason, so I'm in the minority there.

I would be like the other guy buying 7, except they don't really sell it hardly any where any more.
I've had RR picks I like better and RR picks I don't like as much. I find that I'm not a super fan of the Turkey profile. So when I get a Kentucky Spirit or RR that has a lot of the Turkey funk I'm not a big fan. RR picks either have a lot or very little of that funk, and the Saffel is more in line with those.
That's funny you would say that, because I was drinking the Old Ripy just the other night and it's light, young, not very flavor forward and pretty much a big let down. 

W.B. Saffel blows it out of the water.
Source on this? They‚Äôve definitely been popping up all over lately. So, a mislabel seems plausible. But, that would be an epic screwup so, seems doubtful all the same.
My question was more from the standpoint of change in quality from several years ago.  If there was only one release, and what we are seeing now is from the remains of the first tanked release, then the original reviews may have validity.  Not all of the original reviews were high praise.  If there are newer batches being released, then changes can come with newer batches.  Are the newer batches better or worse?  For me, $50 + tax for 375 mL needs to be a pretty sure thing.
I know quite a few folks that have the same opinion as you on the RR Sib. Surprisingly enough, Saffell has been circulating a bit as of recent. Central Texas got quite a few late last year and you can find some on online retailers that ship for pretty close to retail now.

Hopefully you get your hands on some more soon üëç"

***********

**Vaudon Fins Bois Cognac Lot 78/80, Legacy Brandy pick, 52.2%**

**Nose:** Musty antique wood, woody caramel, vanilla, light chocolate, some berries and cherry comes through, floral notes, nose-tingling layer of wood spice. Nice woody caramel nose but just a tad thin and lacking presence

**Taste:** Berries and tart fruit, creamy caramel, big blast of hot spice and bright zingy floral notes, green apple, frosting, sweet toasted wood. The higher abv is apparent on this with some spice heat, but it's not overwhelming and there's plenty of big lively flavor to go with it. Very complex with big action-packed mouthfeel

**Finish:** Bright spice that builds and rides out a long time with green apple, caramel, bright sweet floral notes, some richer graham cracker and pastry

***********

It's a very complex and lively Cognac, which is surprising given the more muted nose. A fair amount of spice and heat but it stays balanced in it s action-packed way. It's maybe just a tad too hot but in a fun way still, like a nice Bourbon kick. Judging from this and the Voyer I reviewed previously, Legacy seems to like more bright and sweet and lively picks. Not your average old dry oak bombs. They are fun profiles.

**Finish:** Spice and bright sweet tropical fruits, sugary frosting, big sweet caramel. The bright fruits just pop and it leaves sweet and very satisfying

***********

Sweet and bright, kind of a fun change from more dry and dignified old Cognacs. There's bright tropical fruits and spice and sugary frosting type notes, with some very mild oak and a nice caramel backbone. The big sweet fruits really take center stage here and it works well. It is on the lighter and smoother side at 43% but still drinks really well I think, great for this kind of style.

**Nose:** Beautiful malty profile, rich sugary barley, butterscotch, biscuit, vanilla, straw, green apple, faint tropical fruits, spice tingle.

**Finish:** No curveballs on the finish! Sweet sugary barley, vanilla frosting, warm and fuzzy malt, faint spice. A satisfying finish, delicious to the very end

**************

I am a huge fan of a good mat bomb and this Scotch delivers exactly that. This is my second Glen Ord and the other one I had is also a superb malty Scotch in the same way, so I think I'm becoming a fan of this distillery. A good malty profile can be deceptively difficult to pull off, so for two completely different IB expressions to pull it off so well is a good sign. It's maybe a tad light, almost drinks like a really rich and flavorful 46%. But it's a minor complaint this stuff is so good. Gonna be looking for more from Glen Ord

So this is a refill bourbon. I've always been a bit curious about that. What kind of flavor profile, out of what you've listed, gets imparted by the refill?

Nice review.
Great review. Love a rich malt bomb too!
A refill bourbon barrel is basically just a tired, worn out barrel that has previously been used to age Scotch already. It's not imparting as much oak interaction anymore. The advantage is that it lets the base flavors of the barley spirit shine without as much bourbon or wood flavor added. That's where you get more of the fresh fruits and florals, sugary frosting, barley/malt/cereal type flavors. A fresher or 1st fill Bourbon barrel would give you more of the oak, vanilla, brasher sweetness, spice type notes. It's a delicate thing though, because if a cask is too tired you basically get raw new make spirit with all it's harsh flavors even after years of aging. So there is some balance involved in pulling it off well
Thanks! This is my second malt bomb Glen Ord and they have both been fantastic, I'm becoming a fan of the distillery. K&L just got another one but it's sherried, I probably still take a chance on it.

https://www.klwines.com/p/i?i=1562727&searchId=380d7458-b38d-4841-9ed0-e7d0435d4595&searchServiceName=klwines-prod-productsearch&searchRank=1
I would qualify that slightly by saying that there seems to be a fair amount of variability in how *tired* each refill barrel is, from one barrel to another. For one thing, we don't know for how long the barrel was previously used - it could have been used for maturing previous scotch for 4 years or for 40 years - that level of detail is almost never disclosed. 

And the really, really old ones may be excellent because of the exceptionally high quality of the wood which was used to make them many decades ago - this has been discussed in the context of the frequency with which very old 4th Refill Butts in the Glenfarclas Family Cask series do extremely well.

My impression is that the risk which you mention ""*if a cask is too tired you basically get raw new make spirit with all it's harsh flavors even after years of aging*"" is something which does have to be taken into account and can happen, but that risk also depends on how clean the style of scotch is which is being put into the refill barrel. 

Some scotches are, when they very young, full of unpleasant notes that really need a more active cask to tame them and settle them down. Others are quite clean and friendly at a relatively young age - it comes down to how that specific malt is produced, in terms of mashing & fermentation, the distillation regime, the cut points used, and the condensation method.

This is where having some familiarity with output from the different distilleries, either from personal drinking experiences & flavor memories, or from reading lots of reviews, and hopefully a bit of both, can come in handy - in making a guess at whether a given malt is likely to be well suited for a refill cask or not.

Cheers
$50? I'd take a chance on that one, too. Thinking about the casks, there are just so many variables that go into producing a nice bottle of whisky.
Hey, I thought, where is this distillery? Oh, I‚Äôve been to this distillery.  Took exterior photos and stopped in for a dram. Man, Im looking forward to going back to Scotland. Last there in 2016.  Lots of fun.
Interesting insights on what impact the selection of a cask and the new make, make up together, to produce a nice bottle of whisky. This has to come down to the distiller knowing their new make, familiar with their casks and I think, a bit of luck. Thank you and u/buckydean for always interesting reads!
Oh hey I somehow missed your reply. Yes like u/hmmm said, you always have very interesting insights thank you so much. I almost included your first paragraph in my reply above but was trying to keep it simple, the guy sounded like a beginner. 

But the idea of new make being different quality from different distilleries makes perfect sense, that's a really cool thought. When you look at (good) tequila and brandy, and especially calvados you get stuff that is amazing right off the still. And they can play around with very light barrel aging of months to just a few years to give a subtle wood influence. It makes perfect sense that Sctotch distilleries can do the same. We've all had those 10-15 year IB's, light in color, that despite the age just taste like rotten new make and ethanol. Now I wish I could go around tasting every Scotch distilleries new make spirit. 

You really can't underestimate how complex making and aging spirits is. So many factors come together to make the end result it's so amazing
Honestly it's not even about the money anymore. I just don't want to waste the shelfspace on something meh that will take me years to get through. I think I'm at a point where I need to just give away some bottles that I don't care for and get my valuable shelf real estate back
Hah, I know exactly what you mean. I gave away a bunch of bottles about a year and a half ago. Very nice whisky but I was never going to finish the bottles. That still left me with bottles under my desk, in my closet, behind my desk and on shelves ( out of control? nah!) I've been careful since then about just picking things up that I really enjoy. I know what I like and have just been focusing on those bottles as opposed to buying everything that gets good reviews and sounds good. 
That said, Binnys just got some Glencadam in. Both 10 yo and 21 yo. Showing proper restraint, I'll pass on the 10 yo and get a bottle of the 21 yo. I think the 10 is good but I have a bunch of similar bottles that are good. I'm trying to focus on bottles that I think are really good. 
All said, a bottle that I'm really enjoying is a bottle of Craigellachie 13 yo. Inexpensive ($50) and just amazing, IMHO but you have to like kind of smoky sulfur but just on the nose and initial taste with a bit of funk.
Cheers!
Yes exactly. At this point we have had so much great stuff and we have become spoiled. ""Good"" Scotch or ""Good for the price"" kind of stuff just doesn't cut it, I don't really want to bother unless it's spectacular. 

And yes! I love Craigellachie, the 13 was always a really solid bottle with that killer meaty and bold maltiness. Their IB's can be great too it's a distillery I really like. They do well with sherry too"

American Whiskey review #254

***********

**""Remus Repeal Reserve"" Bourbon Series V, 50%**

**Nose:** Deep toasted oak and spice, brown sugar, musty wood, hot cherry, leathery tannins, chocolate, charred vanilla, big cinnamon spice. Nice darker toasted wood notes but still very lively

**Taste:** Thick brown sugar, vanilla, brash deeply toasted oak, mild bitter tannins, hot spice and cherry, some older musty wood, minty spice. Does a great job of feeling darker but not overly tannic or bitter, lots of lively sweetness and smooth spice. Drinks great at 50%, big lively mouthfeel with just a slight tinge of heat

**Finish:** Building spice heat and cherry, sweet vanilla, descends into more tannic wood and char, smooth minty spice

************

A nice balance of darker older wood notes and sweet brash Bourbon. It's surprisingly spicy actually, I thought being 50% was a sign that it was going to be watered down to a smoother mouthfeel but this stuff still has plenty of spice action. It's a nice kind of lively Bourbon kick that is tasty. Sweet and brash and oaky. Good stuff but for the age and decent abv I was hoping for a little more, something that maybe showed it's age better with some heavier wood notes and a thicker mouthfeel. Don't think I'll be looking for a bottle. But even well-aged MGP Bourbon hasn't totally worked for me in the past so maybe this just favors a mashbill I'm not a big fan of. Minor complaint though, it's good.

My Bourbon of 2021. Was able to buy 3 bottles before the hype came.
Been looking to try this one but have yet to see one in NYC, either in store or online.
The only gripe I have is that it‚Äôs 100 proof. Another 10 points would be perfect. However the high rye mashbill makes do. 
8.5/10.
I happen to be drinking RRRV as I'm typing this and I gotta agree with your review. It would be better if it had more oak, viscosity and longer finish. As a comparison, I had Knob Creek 15 recently and, to my palate, it crushes RRRV in those three characteristics - especially as they are both 100 proof. RRRV does have a larger variety of flavors, though.
This bottle was pretty good but nothing close to the hype it received. Still can't wrap my head around that. Then again MGP often loses for me in blinds so my opinion is probably skewed.
7 is fair tbh. For the specs it is kind of a let down
I just did a review of good ol fashioned remus and I loved it. I‚Äôm looking for this bottle.  I can‚Äôt wait to get my hands on one.
I found a series 3 for $89 last week. It is absolutely amazing! 
8 all day
As always great review :)
Is this a new brand or something? I'm seeing this all over this sub.
The bitter notes were overpowering from the neck pour for me.  I'm hoping it gets better after letting the bottle breath for a few weeks and revisit it again.
Agree, missing that thicker mouthfeel. Tasted it against Sam Houston 15 and SM was a head above.
Ugh I just opened mine too and loved it. Went back to my local liquor store and they'd raised the price from retail to $200! I loved it but on principle I won't support price gouging.
I had a helluva time getting one bottle of the release 5. Then over the last couple weeks I've seen multiple bottles of releases 2 & 4 dusty on local shelves at normal retail. Still can't find a backup of V.
Yeah, I almost included all the info in my review but I figured the info was easy enough to find with a google search
Hands down my number one pick from 2021. On my third bottle and pick up any extras I can find.
Store in Missoula, MT had plenty of them a month ago, I bought a 2nd while I was up there.
Passed on it a few times...now it's gone.  Nice that you were on it!
Try not to drink high proof for a week and then try it again. Drinking high proof all the time can really dull the tastebuds.
Exactly. I'm not trying to rag on the stuff, it is good stuff. I was just expecting a little more given the stats
Yeah
 I wouldn't actively search for more. But it's a decent bottle. Little pricey for mgp juice
It's not new, I think its been a yearly release for several years now. It's just gotten a lot more hyped up this year and hype tends to snowball
Jesus! My local Sams club just had this for $70 and I bought me a bottle.  I Should go back and see if there‚Äôs any left. On initial bottle pop it was good but I think it needs a bit of air time.
Series II was the best of them IMHO, I'd snatch that up.
I couldn‚Äôt find a single bottle. I actually one my one in a charity donation raffle. Bummed I couldn‚Äôt snag another.
I would be tempted to give it an 8 on your scale.  I'm not a high proof guy and for 100 proof this had a lot of great flavors going on.  I haven't given KC 15 a try -- it's $30-$40 more in my market.
There is zero MGP whisky at this age available for less. I think it‚Äôs a great deal.
Pricey for 13-16 year MGP????
Have a bottle of II & IV open and have picked up a backup of each over the last couple weeks. Just stunned to keep finding these given the number of hunter hobbiests in the area.
Agreed. 8 or 8.5, I think.
Nah, less than $10/year and it‚Äôs better than many allocated KY juice, I think it‚Äôs a steal.
Yeah these have been flying under the radar for several years now, it's funny how myopic the taters can be. In my area, you could pretty easily find any given batch a full year after it was released. Pretty sure III is still around in small quantities here, and IV & V are pretty much everywhere. Meanwhile people walk right past it and go apeshit for NAS Smokewagon.

Unfortunately, I think this may be coming to an end. Now that MGP has announced the $600 gift set (which only contains four 375ml bottles!?!@#!), taters are starting to take notice.
Probably won't find them for long
I agree. I was replying to the guy who said it was expensive for MGP juice
Ah, sorry."

**Taste:** Strawberry, dark cherry, caramel, honey, fruity wine, sweet honeyed malt, a mild wine tartness, spice. Very fruity and almost syrupy-sweet but not overwhelming. Fruits are well balanced by lots of thicker honey and caramel. This is a dessert Scotch and it works well

**Finish:** The fruits and caramel carry big into the finish, sweet and happy with some bright spice and sweet cake frosting

****************

Very pleasant Scotch. Smooth sweet fruity wine influence that doesn't overwhelm or cross into ""wine bomb"" territory at all. This is exactly how I like my wine influence: fruity and sweet, complimenting the Scotch without overwhelming it. A finish is perfect for that kind of profile. This is actually on the heavier side of that window but luckily doesn't cross over too far for my personal tastes. Another example of Bunnahabhain taking well to wine influence.

Brandy review #90

**Villa Zarri Italian Brandy 1989 30 year, 53%**

**Nose:** Dark and woody. Thick chocolatey wood, musty and tannic, vanilla, cacao, sweet barrel char, graham cracker, leather, anise, dark bitter fruits. 

**Taste:** Wow, so woody and tannic. Dark chocolate, dark bitter wood, spice, understated black cherry, toffee, barrel char, dry tannic oak, tobacco. There's some darker toffee sweetness and barrel char to balance it out, doesn't feel overly dry or bitter. Just thick and dark and woody

**Finish:** Dry tannic wood and oak spice builds big, old and antique feeling, some sweet barrel char, toffee, vanilla. There's some brief dark grape and caramel sweetness before it descends back into dry tannic wood, really nice complexity

******************

This is a hefty brandy. Lots of dark rich wood notes, but not overly dry or tannic. Nice play between chocolatey rich wood and drier tannins. Fruits are very understated and mellow, it's all about the dark complex wood here. If you enjoy something a little sweeter and more fruity it might not be for you, but if you want to explore the older darker woody side it's great.

u/buckydean...I tried my remaining sample of this today and I was able to detect the more chocolatey and woody flavors than I did initially. The woody notes were stronger than I recalled initially. I wished these bottles won't f*** with my taste buds like this. It underscores why I try not to judge a bottle by my first pour. I don't know if it is my palate changing based on what I ate last, or if some air did it more good. But, I really, really enjoyed it today and do not regret grabbing a couple of bottles. Certainly worth the price to me when I compare it to some other cognac/armagnac bottles I have bought in this price range. Thanks again for this review that does a better job than I can put in words.
Hey thanks for the review. I saw this on the K&L website and came here to find your review. I am new to brandy, in fact I don‚Äôt own a single bottle. I prefer cask strength Islay Scotch but obviously a 30 year cask strength scotch will cost thousands, meanwhile a brandy like this only cost $150. Are there any cask strength, older brandy‚Äôs you would recommend? Something you would give a 9 or 10/10?
Honestly, a lot of people have really loved this Villa Zarri barrel. My score seems to be the low outlier. I will probably still buy this because I did love it and I think it has potential to grow on me more. It has a lot of darker woody and chocolatey notes so it still might be up your alley.

But I can still give some recs for stuff I liked more. My first thought is a couple aficionado picks, picked by some of the same people who do the r/Scotch and r/Bourbon picks. 

[Tessendier Lot 95](https://seelbachs.com/products/through-the-grapevine-tessendier-lot-95-selected-by-bourbon-pursuit-the-mash-drum-rare-bird-101?_pos=1&_sid=695b66db9&_ss=r) is fantastic and was picked by a pretty diverse group. 

[Grosperrin lot 72](https://www.finedrams.com/grosperrin-n-72-grande-champagne-cognac-aficionados-x-fine-drams.html) is purely an afish pick. 

[Pasquet Famille Claude](https://www.cognac-expert.com/hors-d-age-cognac/pasquet-tresors-de-famille-claude-cognac)-Not and afish pick but it is one of the better ones I've had recently. Be aware it's a 500ml bottle

That covers Cognac, there's some armagnac options too. On that same FineDrams site I linked above, look through the Encantadas. I think the standouts were Cassou, Belair, Le Freche, and Mamoulens. There's descriptions on the page and I reviewed them all so you can look through to see if any sound good to you. These are all 500ml bottles as well

All these suggestions were 8s and 9s for me, I don't really score 10's very often. But off the top of my head it's some of the better brandy I've had lately that is still available. Also, just for fun on FineDrams look for the Grosperrin 45. It's another afish pick, a Cognac from 1945. I haven't tried it yet so I can't say how it is but they usually pick good stuff. Pricey obviously but not crazy for the age
You‚Äôre a legend. Thank you so much. I‚Äôm going to start looking through the links you sent."

Brandy review #89

****************

**Giboin Cognac Borderies Lot 1974-8, #A230, 43%**

**Nose:** Rich creamy toffee and caramel, sweet brown sugar, thick honey, milk chocolate and grape, sweet berry, thick caramel-toasted wood, it's almost butterscotchy in it's creaminess but it's darker and richer than that. Some older tannic tobacco type notes but it smoothly melds into the creamy toffee and woody thickness

**Taste:** On the palate, this delivers everything I had hoped for from the awesome nose. Thick creamy caramel and toffee, syrupy and thick the way it coats the mouth and velvety smooth, milk chocolate, dark rich honey, mellow baking spice, thick smooth oak, bright sweet apple and berry fruits, caramel-covered grape. This is freaking beautiful. Effortlessly rich and balanced and super drinkable

**Finish:** Bright grape and fruits, sweet brown sugar, toasted wood, vibrant baking spice, light tart berries and apple, sweet creamy toffee. Delicious complexity on the finish with the vibrant spice and tarter fruit popping up. Delicious

*******************

I challenge anyone to try this and not fall in love. No matter what you're into, whether you're a die-hard brandy freak or you've never had Cognac before. It's so agreeable, so drinkable, the flavor just flows so beautifully. Thick and mouthcoating but velvety smooth at the 43% abv. This is exactly how a lower abv Brandy should drink.

**Domaine de Jean-Bon 1999 16 year, 45%**

**Nose:** Thick caramel, graham cracker, sweet toasted wood and vanilla, fruity caramel covered grape, cherry, minty spice. Sweet and inviting

**Taste:** Caramel, big sweet toasted wood, chocolate grape, sweet cherry, some bright floral notes, light bitter woodiness and lively spice heat. Really nice caramel barrel sweetness and vanilla. Smooth balanced mouthfeel with some spice heat action

**Finish:** Sweet caramel and floral notes, spice, cherry, mildly tannic wood, some milk chocolate and vanilla. Pleasant sweet finish

******************

For the young age I wasn't sure what to expect. But it's delicious! Totally worth the $70 it's going for on K&L. Like the other two older vintages, plenty of complex oak notes. This one heavily favors the sweeter oak notes like caramel and sweet toasted vanilla, not nearly as much darker chocolate or tannic notes as the 90 and 79. A little more brighter floral character pops up too. It's not quite as rich as the older vintages and it's a bit hotter, but a really fun and tasty little budget-friendly yak

Thanks for the great review! I felt the same way about the excellent bang/buck ratio of this bottle. The nose is powerful and delicate at the same time, lovely taste and finish. This is one where you don't mind leaving the empty Glencairn on the nightstand for the residual aroma (just did last night).

I'm actually out of the country until the latter part of 2022, and your reviews here have convinced me to order the '90 and '96 and have a family member hold them for me until I can retrieve them.

**Taste:** Dark tannic oak, smooth dark chocolate, cacoa, heavy vanilla, sweet burnt caramel, minty spice, sweet cherry, fruity grape, some smooth woody tannins. It's dark and oaky but in a rich chocolatey way, tons of vanilla and barrels sweetness and somehow some nice fruity grape emerges from all this dark wood.

**Finish:** Sweet charred barrel and vanilla, chocolate covered cherry, caramel toasted oak, trails off with sweet caramel, rich wood, cherry. Smooth chocolatey-sweet finish

************

This stuff is killer, a really cool dark and chocolatey style of Armagnac. The 1979 definitely touched on this same style but there was more graham cracker and caramel type wood. The color on this one doesn't lie, it's more oaky and dark and chocolatey than the 79 even though it's a whole 10 years younger. But it's not an oaky assault at all, richly smooth and well-balanced. Spoiler alert, after tasting through all three I think this one is the best showcase of their use of new oak and it's probably my favorite.

**Taste:** Woody caramel, chocolate, thick cherry wood, bright spice, smooth chocolatey toasted oak, mild tannic bite, vanilla, understated grape and black cherry, some dry older wood with big wood spice. Delicious complex oak notes and understated fruits, thickly balanced

**Finish:** Gets lively and pops with wood spice, mint, woody caramel, chocolate, sweet cherry, lingering dry wood and spice. Smoothly tannic and woody

************

Lots of rich and complex wood notes but it doesn't feel overly oaked at all. It's very well-balanced with just the right amount of spice and tannic bite. The smoother chocolatey and graham cracker notes are really nice. Not nearly as oaky as I would have thought given the age and their use of 100% new oak in the aging. So I'm not really sure how they accomplish this really interesting profile. But it's delicious

*****************

**Domaine de Baraillon 1982 39 year Bas-Armagnac, 48%**

**Nose:** Burnt grape, rancio, dark sweet toasted oak, dank wet wood, bitter chocolate, bold fruity grape and cherry, vanilla, mellow wood spice. It's as dark as I was expecting from the color but not tannic or dry. Lots of sweetness from the barrel notes, vanilla and bold fruits still. Great nose

**Taste:** Big dose of rancio and burnt grape, caramel, smooth tannic oak, wood spice, just slightly mouth-puckering though. There's still tons of sweet vanilla, bold fruity cherry/grape sweetness, toffee, dank wet wood. This stuff is really delicious and interesting. Big dose of darker wood and rancio compared to the rest but still has lots sweetness and bold fruits.

**Finish:** Rancio, dark fruity grape, heavy vanilla, sweet barrel char, thick caramel, some peppery spice. The thick sweetness of the grape and vanilla melds with the smooth dark rancio beautifully, stays in character til the end and lingers

********************

I've been really curious about this one, with it being the darkest and highest abv of the whole series and all. And I'm glad I saved it for last because it really stands out as unique from the rest. Much more rancio-heavy and it goes beautifully with all the sweetness. The only other one that stands out as being this unique is the 1980 with it's more tannic and dry woodiness. I really love this 1982 with it's darker more rancio-heavy profile, but the warmer caramel oakiness of the others is reeeally nice too. This will go down as one of my favorites of the series though, along with the 1972 and 1976. What I can say for sure is that I'm a fan of Baraillon, and abv doesn't seem to be huge deal with these guys. The 43-44% stuff drank every bit as good as the 47-48% ones.

*****************

Like I said in one of the earlier reviews, ""rich and smoothly balanced."" It just keeps applying to these. Seems to be a common trait of these Baraillons. For being so similar in age with each other and so much older than all the rest, this 1972 is quite different from the 1973. The 73 was more dark and woody, more rancio. This one has a delicious sweet creaminess to it and brighter fruits, but still plenty of wood and mild tannins. At first I slightly preferred the 73, but on this second tasting I think the 72 has pulled ahead. It's a close call though and more personal preference than anything else though, they are all fantastic.

Yet another fantastic Baraillon. Oddly enough the 80 still felt older, there was more tannic and dry oakiness to that one. This one is dark and woody with a heavier dose of rancio but also exuberant with it's big sweet oak and bold fruits. These just keep getting better with age, which seems obvious but isn't always the case with armagnac. The bump up in abv probably isn't hurting either.

This one has some thick woody and fruity sweetness and just a touch of rancio and tannins, doesn't taste as ""old"" as the 1980 even though it's actually older.

The 1985 was a sweet spot for rich heavy oak and sweet fruits with just a touch of tannins. This one, for being only a few years older has really dialed up the tannic oak.

I think this is my first Glentauchers, it's a solid Scotch but nothing really stands out here as special. It's the kind of bottle that would be good at about $60(or maybe $75 these days) but I would be disappointed if I paid $100 for it. It's enjoyable enough though. I did try adding water since it was a touch hot, but I don't like the result. Smoothed it out too much and made it a little boring. The vibrant cinnamon and spice, while hot, actually adds some nice complexity and liveliness to it that I enjoyed

As the name suggests, this Cognac is an ode to Claude and his wife Arlette who, although not named, was fundamental to its creation. Claude and Arlette have dedicated their lives to caring for their vineyards, family, and business as an impenetrable duo, and such was their devotion that they even planted the day after their own wedding. A passion for hard work and viticulture runs deep through both Claude and Arlette‚Äôs veins. The vineyard from which this Cognac came belonged to Claude‚Äôs mother‚Äôs family and is today run by Claude and Arlette‚Äôs grandchildren.

**************

**Jean-Luc Pasquet Cognac Tr√©sors de Famille ""Claude"" Lot 84, 49.8%**

**Nose:** Caramel, butterscotch, thick and creamy, sweet candied nuts, sugary fruits of plum and cherry, warm grape, exotic spice, root beer. I love it

**Taste:** Oh mama. Thick caramel and butterscotch, such a thick mouthfeel, big dry woodiness, nutty, soft grape, sugary icing, easygoing floral notes, sweet wood spice. Nice sweet caramel type notes but never feels overly sweet, it has a thick and creamy richness to it and plenty of wood. One of the thickest mouthfeel Cognacs I've ever had

**Finish:** Bright sweet caramel, citrus, sweet grape and cherry, thick creamy butterscotch, wood spice. It's a sweet creamy finish with a healthy dose of delicious spice. 

*****************

This is the 3rd and final JLP ""Famille"" Cognac I tried and I was starting to get used to them being darker and more oaky with all the age on them. Holy shit is this one refreshing. It's so thick and creamy with tons of caramel and butterscotch. One of the thickest mouthfeels I've ever seen in a Cognac but in that effortlessly balanced way you get with age. Lots of sweetness and wood and delicious spice along with all the thick creamy richness. This one is a stunner

JLP rarely disappoints, sounds like another winner. (though I wish they'd have some specs available on this one!)

post edit - it's 1984, bad brain
Have you had the Noel one? If so what were your thoughts?
What kind of specs would you want that it doesn't give?
I have not had noel sorry. I've heard it's good, maybe just not quite in the same league. A little more sweet and bright with nice spice. JLP is consistently great though, and it's a pretty low price for these, so I'd say it's probably a pretty safe bet. I actually did buy one I just havent opened it yet
Age, mainly

edit - it's 1984, ignore me, it's been a long day
Any chance you opened the Noel? Debating on whether to add to my order
Haha no prob glad you figured it out
No, never opened it sorry. But everything I said before still stands
How do you feel about Claude vs the Pasquet Afish picks? (worth the $90-100 upcharge?)
I think Lot 70 is the most similar to the claude, and does it a little better as far as being a big cask strength Cognac. Claude is better at being friendly and approachable but without feeling too light. Lot 75 and 68-72 are different beasts, more dark and oak driven"
"Review #634: Jean-Luc Pasquet Cognac L'Esprit de Famille ""Jean"" Lot 69/77, 49.6%",,https://i.redd.it/il1q69qdd7881.jpg,"From Cognac Expert: ""The Pasquet ‚ÄúL‚Äôesprit de famille‚Äù Jean is a Grande Champagne Cognac blend of 1969 and 1977 eaux-de-vie from Jean Blais, who was a fellow vintner and distiller, as well as a neighbor of the Pasquet estate. As with every Cognac in their series of tributes to revered members of the Cognac community, this offering is close to Pasquet‚Äôs heart.

A friend and neighbor, Jean Blais took Jean-Luc Pasquet under his wing to share with him the ancestral secrets of Cognac production, meaning this bottle brings the two families together just as they were previously. And that‚Äôs not all‚Äì both families also come from outside of Eraville, so their family history, both within Cognac and outside of it, is rich and shared.""

**Nose:** Dank dark toasted wood, vanilla, toffee, rich grape, bright cherry and plum, tropical fruits, floral zing, healthy wood spice, mint, light root beer char

**Taste:** Thick woody mouthfeel, dank wood, vanilla, rich caramel, dry rancio, smooth syrupy grape, brief bit of brighter grape and cherry with sweet wood spice, chocolate mint. For all the rich dark wood there is, lots of fruit still comes through. Excellent rich mouthfeel with flavor that builds big but still feels amazingly balanced and elegant.

**Finish:** The grape sweetens up, rich woody caramel, toasted wood, vanilla, dry wood and soft rancio notes stretch out for a long time with a hint of spice

****************

Another epic Cognac from this Famille series. This one has a little bit of everything: Very classic Cognac feel but with some really nice darker wood notes, big fruits, and dry woody rancio. It's amazing how elegantly it balances out all these flavors into such a rich Cognac. Can't wait for the next one!

**George Dickel Tennessee Whisky ""15 year single barrel"" K&L Wine pick, 50.6%**

**Nose:** Candy cherry, trademark Dickel chalky sweetness, sweet toasted notes, caramel, musty wood, orange marmalade, vanilla

**Taste:**Toasted wood, spice, caramel, mild tannins, sweet black cherry, toasted marshmallow, vanilla char, sweetly toasted, slight mustiness and minerality. Very straight forward smoothly toasted and sweet Bourbon, on the smoother and more drinkable side.

**Finish:** Musty wood, vanilla, sweet toasted oak, mellow cinnamon spice tingle, chalky cherry sweetness, mild tannins, lingering cherry toasted wood 

*************

It's good stuff but a little bit too much of that trademark chalky sweetness comes through for my liking. Especially on the nose. Luckily it's not a flintstone vitamin bomb like some Dickel I've had, those are disgusting. This is very well-balanced still. I'm very sensitive to that chalky flavor but since this is such a well-executed and flavorful Bourbon I will be nice and rate it on quality rather than my personal preference. The previous Mission Wine barrel I did was an easy 7, I will rank this as being right there with it in quality but for my personal preference I liked the other one more

American Whiskey review #252

*************

**George Dickel Tennessee Whisky ""15 year single barrel"" Mission Wine pick, 42.2%**

**Nose:** Big sweet brown sugar, orange, smooth caramel toasted oak, vanilla, light sweet char, very fruity with strawberry and cherry vanilla, mint, light mineral notes in the background. Smooth and sweet and inviting

**Taste:** Cherry cola, root beer, big brown sugar, orange marmalade, caramel oak, tons of vanilla, sweet toasted wood, some sweet gentle spice. There's some mineral notes in the background but I might be looking for it being a Dickel and all, overall it is extremely well balanced. Smooth and sweetly toasted, super drinkable at the low abv but still has great mouthfeel and depth to it.

**Finish:** Big cherry/strawberry candy sweetness, sweet toasted oak, vanilla, some slightly bitter old oak with a gentle undercurrent of wood spice. It's a bit light on the finish but it's very pleasant all the way through

************

As someone who generally doesn't care for Dickel a whole lot, I am pleasantly surprised by this. You basically know what you are signing up for with a 42% Bourbon but this stuff delivers better than I thought it would. Drinks like a healthy 45-47%. Great mouthfeel and depth to the flavor but so smooth and drinkable(this doesn't always have to be a bad thing when done right!). Low abv can work well sometimes, especially when it's natural strength. I'm not sure if these are truly barrel proof or not but I'm guessing even if it's not it is still close to it. This is a good example of a nice low-proof, smooth-sipping Bourbon

The year is 2025. Dickel juice is highly sought after. Every tater Gen Z/Gen Next ask about Dickel in the back. All Gen Xers and older snicker every time. We all get banished for our childlike humor.
I agree this is the best value for a 15 Year American whiskey. I also have a bottle from Mission Spirits (I ordered through their website). The only disappointment is the low proof.
I‚Äôm beginning to think the bottle I picked up was a lemon. Borderline undrinkable. Sour pungent rotten corn flavor.
I'm going to have to get some Dickel 15, now after all these positive reviews.  But at least I'll get to ask my wife if she'd like to try some Dickel.  Damn, I promised I'd be a grown up.
Looks like some good dickel (that‚Äôs what she said)
Gah. I got corrected regarding proof on a 15-year Dickel post a couple days ago. Apparently they release these at possibly 4 different strengths, from 80 up to near or at barrel strength at 105, they're pretty cagey about how much water is added. I just searched the interwebs and 80-105 is all I can find and not even on the Dickel website.
Dickel can be really awful stuff when it's bad, so I'm not surprised. Some of the worst bourbons I've had have been dickel
My 15-year store pick is 104 proof and was supposedly bottled at cask strength but the bottle doesn't outright state it, so who knows.
All are virtually barrel strength according to Dickel head distiller Nicole Austin.  In order to limit the number of proofs, she proofed down just a percentage or two on all of them.  Dickel goes in at a lower proof, just over 100 and depending on the barrel and will finish aging at various strengths.
as i understand (hearsay), they added a consistent amount of water to all barrels. so, none are barrel proof.
I have one of the 80 proof bottles and despite the low proof it has one of the wildest noses of anything in my collection. Like sheer number of tasting notes exceeds everything else. Huge fan, and hoping to find higher proof versions someday.
Wow! You're saying my 80 proof bottle is nearly barrel strength!? I might actually believe that given the complexity and length of finish. Truly unique stuff.
I have the same experience, but on the opposite spectrum. It has a ton of stuff going on but nothing is good. It‚Äôs crazy complex but with bad flavors. I don‚Äôt honestly even dislike it because it‚Äôs just so damn different. By far the weirdest whiskey on my shelf

***********

**""Jack Daniel's Single Barrel"" Barrel Proof r/Bourbon pick, barrel #21-21046, 65.15%**

**Nose:** Huge charred oak, strong mocha and coffee, brown sugar, charred maple, banana, vanilla, menthol spice. Fantastic nose it really jumps out of the glass at you. Super sweet and vibrant, tons of oak, and some coffee and banana to give it a fun unique feel

**Taste:** Big blast of brown sugar and sweet toasted oak, big sweet spice, cherry, maple char, vanilla, tons of vibrant toasted and charred wood, pecan nuttiness, coffee, mint. It's so oaky but it's so vibrant and sweet at the same time. These have such a unique and fun profile to me. Fantastic

**Finish:** Builds to a big blast of sweet spice and sweet toasted oak, cherry, mint, mocha, smooth funky banana, vanilla. The smooth banana and sweet toasted oak carry a long time

***************

I am always blown away by these barrel proof single barrels from Jack Daniel's, they are so good and such a unique profile. And even with that, this still manages to be a standout barrel. Doesn't feel too hot, it uses every bit of it's high abv to deliver tons of action-packed flavor. Not just delicious but also a lot of fun to drink.

I have a bottle of single barrel that I really enjoy. I need to get my hands on the barrel proof.
All that and the bottle is pretty cool too!

Cheers!
130 proof, Jesus Christ
My bottle has opened up nicely over the months. I normally drink neat but this the only one I can drink neat or on ice without it turning bitter at the finish.
Nice review. Any chance you have the rickhouse # on this bottle?  
I only ask because I have a single barrel with the same ABV and barrel #21-21063
Jack Daniels is not Bourbon it's Tennessee whiskey , don't make that mistake again!
One of my favs‚Ä¶ love the higher proofsüòÅ
WHEW! Glad to see folks love on this super out there JD. 

Additionally, I dig their new plaque etching
Was this pour really hot? I keep trying to enjoy JD barrel proofs (this and the rye), but it‚Äôs just too hot to taste anything!! Is it just me? I love the regular singke barrel rye (red label), and JD got me into whiskey‚Ä¶
The regular single barrel is good stuff too. But the barrel proof really kicks it up a few notches
And yours isn't the r/bourbon pick? Where did you get it? I can check when I get home
I never called it bourbon! If you're referring to the fact that its posted in r/Bourbon, that's ok because all kinds of american whiskey is allowed here such as rye and american single malt. (I realize you're probably just fooling around haha)
Yeah that metal tag is pretty cool
> Additionally, I dig their new plaque etching

I thought I broke my bottle when the plaque rattled hard as I was unboxing it and then was quite relieved when I saw the nice r/bourbon plaque.  

Also this a fantastic bottle of not bourbon bourbon.
Thumbs-up from me too. Just poured one this evening when I got home. Noticed it on the shelf and thought ""Why is that bottle so full??"" (Not because I didn't like it...I've just been neglecting it somehow. It's standing right next to others that are getting perilously empty!)
I was gonna say! I got a Total Wine pick of SBBP and holy shit my first pour was hot af. My roomie called it effectively ""Alcohol.rar"". I like myself some barrel proof whiskey too. My daily drinkers are Barrel Seagrass and Wild Turkey Rare Breed, so it's not like I'm not used to cask strength stuff
Also, try taking a deep breath before drinking it. Inhaling alcohol vapors is what makes you cough.
Are you used to drinking barrel proof stuff? I would say it's at hot as I would expect at 65%, but not overly so. Actually I think it drinks pretty good for the abv. Barrels may vary too, but i have had a few of these now and I find them pretty consistent
That‚Äôs what I like to hear! I just looked at it today when I was at the ABC, I should have just grabbed it.
No it is not. It is a ""Selected by us for you"" pick from a local grocery chain liquor shop by me.
I asked for a 4ft option for wall mounting but all I could hear was the lady laughing on the other side of the phone
Yeah I‚Äôm not a huge fan of barrel proofs to be honest‚Ä¶ so I guess I need to find a way to make them smoother (ice perhaps)
Oh my bad I thought you were saying yours was the same barrel # as this one, I see now it's just similar. Interesting. Anyway this one is Rick no L-31. What's yours?
I bought a bottle yesterday but it didn‚Äôt come with the tag. Just ‚Äúregular‚Äù JD single barrel proof
I snagged a bottle and agree it‚Äôs a hard eight
Try a dash of water. I like to use a 1/2 tsp to add water so I can control it better and not add too much, just keep adding til it's where you like it. In my opinion when you get spirits cold with ice it mutes the flavor too much. But lots of people enjoy some ice with their whiskey so whatever works for you. Experiment with it a little and have fun
I agree with the water suggestion, but I'll also toss out that sometimes you can ""work up"" to a barrel proof over the course of a tasting. It's a bit like eating spicy food, a gradual increase is a lot better than diving right in.

Usually when I'm going to do a review of a high/barrel proof I'll pour myself some 100~ proof whiskey first, let my palate get used to a bit of burn, then move to the heavy hitters. Of course you might also just not be into barrel proof. I love it, as do so many others, but I also think it's a big fad right now. I'd love to see more distilleries proof stuff down for flavor.
Oh yeah sorry for confusion! Mine is rick no. L-31 as well. With a dump date of 6-29-2021
Looks like mine was dumped about 1 month later. 7-27-21

Very cool that they are so similar!
Yeah I find it fascinating how similar two different barrels actually are. I‚Äôm saving you post and going to compare tasting notes."

**Nose:** Rich antique wood, dry and musty, cigar, dark grape sweetness, vanilla, woody toffee, faint mint, wood spice. Delicious!

**Taste:** Oh yeah, this is nice. Rich antique wood, thick sweet caramel, wood spice, cacao, vanilla, sweet grape, dryer tannic wood notes and gentle spice start building on the tail end. Big dry Cognac woodiness that never feels too bitter, but there's a nice layer of caramel and sweet grape to it. So complex yet thick and effortlessly balanced. 

**Finish:** Dry mouth-puckering wood builds beautifully, tobacco, cacao, wood spice, builds to a bright pop of caramel-covered grape with delicious wood spice. Excellent finish

***************

This is reeeally nice. Rich dry tannic Cognac wood is on full display here, but with lots of complexity of sweeter wood notes and grape that all balance out thickly. There's some old woody flavor here but doesn't feel weighed down by it's age. Still very vibrant. Just a beautiful Cognac

**Nose:** First thing that strikes me here is an almost marc-like bitterness, not nearly as aggressive but it's there. Bitter grape skin, tart berry, cherry pez, caramel, floral and sugary sweetness, light sweet vanilla. With air it levels out beautifully

**Taste:** Elegant caramel, musty, dry sweet wood, tart berry, hint of bitter grape skins, sugary cherry fruitiness, easygoing floral notes, gentle spice tingle. It's all very elegantly balanced, rich flavor with a nice smooth mouthfeel at 42%

**Finish:** Dry wood, caramel, nuttiness, light spice. A very light finish, this stuff is delicate and tasty all the way through

**High Wire Watermelon Brandy 2016, 40%**

**Nose:** Funky spirity new-make, buttered popcorn, grassiness, vanilla cream, some vague sugary fruit notes, bitter fruit rind. Spirity and funky with brandy notes only just creeping in

**Taste:** Soft vanilla cream, sweet sugary fruit, doesn't immediately strike me as watermelon but it's there, it's more just a vague kind of sugary fruitiness. Slight funk but it's tame at the low abv. Mouthfeel is a little watered down but that might be helping it here. Overall, flavor is better than the nose 

**Finish:** Sweet vanilla cream, soft spice, gets a little more recognizable watermelon flavor on the tail end

*************

It's ok but nothing amazing. The nose is the worst part which might actually be good news for some people but I happen to place a lot of importance on nosing my spirits. I generally enjoy nosing almost as much as the taste itself. The finish might save it, the recognizable watermelon flavor finally comes together and it's nice.

****************

**Humbrecht Marc de Gewurztraminer 1976-2016, 63.1%**

**Nose:** Dear lord, that wild Marc nose. Huge chalky sweetness, smarties candy, dish soap, cherry candy, bitter estery grape skin, but there's also rich toasted wood, caramel, tons of milk chocolate, mint. These odd notes should clash but they meld perfectly, it's wild and mellow at the same time. And we're only on the nose so far

**Taste:** Complex isn't even the word for this. You take a sip, and it's like your tongue is thrown into an adventure. So much going on! There's caramel and grape, quickly explodes with a blast of zingy spice and bright estery bitter grape, chalky candy sweetness, dish soap, a flavor of bright green cilantro or parsley, bright sugary tropical fruits, stone fruits and their bitter pits. Funky and almost chemical-y but in a good way. Considering the age there is not much heavy wood here. Every bit of the high abv delivers tons of bright funky marc flavor but with just enough caramel and age to smooth out the edges

**Finish:** Bitter estery grape smoothed out with caramel, milk chocolate, sweet candy cherry, chalky marc sweetness and caramel lingers a long time

What a wild ride. It's an adventure of flavor unlike almost anything I've had. You are swept up in it and you don't have time to consider whether you like it or not, you just have to buckle up for the ride. But then you realize that you want to go again. The age and oak has somehow not even come close to taming the bright marc character here. It somehow achieves some kind of balance that uses it's huge abv and funky flavor to it's advantage

American Whiskey review #250

****************

**Nashville Barrel Company Rye (MGP) 7 year, ""0075"" barrel #34, 56.64%**

**Nose:** Wow, immediately hits as an amazing nose. Rich toffee, graham cracker, chocolate mint, gentle herbal spice, cinnamon pastry, sweet warm cherry, pine needle, pecan, vanilla. 

**Taste:** Syrupy caramel, cherry cough syrup, herbal rye spice kick, cinnamon pastry, toasted wood, roasted nuts, clean minty rye. Herbal spice and cherry syrup gives it a sweet and hot little rye kick. It's not super oaky but there's lots of nice toasted and savory/pastry type notes, and plenty of sweetness. Doesn't quite live up to how amazingly rich that nose is but it's still totally delicious

**Finish:** Sweet toasted wood and a big herbal spice kick, toffee, chocolate mint. A long sweetly toasted and herbal spicey rye finish

*******************

Another great MGP rye from Nashville Barrel company. I've had quite a few now and these guys just can't seem to do wrong. Credit to whoever 0075 is for picking it too, but NBC clearly gives access to some special barrels however the hell they do it. As a long time fan of MGP rye who was sad to see the the well-aged Willett and Smooth Ambler Old Scout picks go away, I am on cloud nine with these picks lately.

Great review. I have an 8yr store pick from my local shop and it is my favorite non-finished rye at the moment. Maybe the r/bourbon Wilderness Trail can dethrone it?
Actually, that's 007.5. James Bond's half brother.
Great review as usual! And happy you like it too. This was my first NBC and the rest is history üòÇ
I haven't had Wilderness Trail yet but I hear good things. From what I can tell though Wilderness Trail uses more of a barely legal rye mashbill, so even if it's great it will be hard to compare to an MGP 95% mashbill. As a huge rye fiend nothing else satisfies quite like MGP. Except for maybe WhistlePig 10 year single barrels
These are just all so great, any one of them so far would have been great as a first barrel"

American Whiskey review #249

******************

**Redwood Empire ""Haystack Needle"" double barrel 12 year Bourbon(MGP), chardonnay finish, 55%**

**Nose:** Big toasted wood, oaky caramel, toasted nuts, cherry, vanilla, tons of sweet candy fruitiness, strawberry, cherry, chocolate, mellow minty spice. Very much noses like a big smooth oaky Bourbon but with tons of sweet fruitiness

**Taste:** Caramel dipped cherry, big toasted wood, vanilla, sweet Bourbon corn, lots of candy fruitiness, herbal spice. Like the nose it drinks totally like a Bourbon, just an impossibly sweet and fruity one. There's enough mellowness from the age and beautiful warm oak notes to balance it out, and all the notes meld perfectly. It's like Bourbon candy

**Finish:** Big warm herbal spice, cherry, sweet toasted wood, clean Bourbon corn. Long lingering notes of oaky caramel and gentle spice with just a hint of tannins and sweet fruit

*************

The whole idea of wine finished Bourbon has always weirded me out a little, even though I'm fine when they do it to Rye(High West/MWND) and Scotch. So I guess I'm a bit of a hypocrite. I've never explored it much, but this is delicious. The fruity wine influence is noticeable but well-balanced enough that it might have passed for an impossibly fruity and sweet Bourbon/Rye in a blind tasting. I might have to check out more wine aged Whiskey, although sherry still weirds me out. Baby steps

Love your reviews. Im always keeping an eye out for any iterations of the Haystack Needles but have yet to see any. For a solid finished whiskey that won't break the bank, give the Bull Run American finished Whiskeys a try.14 year Cask Strength at under $100 delivered to the door from Seelbach's. The finish smooths out the proof and both provides depth and fruitiness. Well blended and well finished. Cheers.
Didn't realize Redwood Empire had another expression out there. I keep a bottle of their Lost Monarch on hand all the time.

Even though Eagle Rare bourbon is what got me to enjoy whisky (always have 1 bottle on hand also), I ended up being more of a ~~scotch~~ non-bourbon and rye guy. If I see a non-standard american expression, I perk up immediately.

Show me all the american single malts and weird finishes.
Nice review. Grizzly beast, rocket top and lost monarch  are Redwood Empire's own juice right? This was high aged mgp to get them started right? 

Ps for what it is worth Grizzly Beast is fantastic. I haven't tried the other two yet.
Damn that sounds good and similar to the profile of this one. Thanks for the rec, and thanks for reading!
Their own distillery didn't start up until mid-2010s, so anything older is still sourced.
Lost monarch is a blend of emerald giant and pipe dream. Grizzly Beast and Rocket Top are their own distillate. Haystack Needle is 12-14 year old mgp bourbon.
Im not familiar with their brands, this bottle is actually the first I've heard of the distillery
Im not familiar with their brands, this bottle is actually the first I've heard of the distillery
Thanks super helpful. If grizzly beast is a sign of what is to come for Redwood Empire's distillate then we are in store for some great bourbon and rye!
Pipe Dream is fantastic for $30."

Scotch reviews #272/273

*****************

**Laphroaig 10 year Cask Strength batch 006, 58%**

**Nose:** Huge phenolic peat, like huuuge, thick and medicinal, big vanilla, caramel, brine, sweet toasted wood, spice. That medicinal peat is just massive here it's unreal

**Taste:** Huge onslaught of thick charred peat, tons of vanilla, rich caramel, brine, peppery spice, sweet toasted wood. Massive peat with really sweet and toasted rich wood notes

**Finish:** menthol spice and thick peat, vanilla, sweet toasted wood. There's peat and vanilla and sweet root beer char that lingers forever

**********************************

**Laphroaig 10 year Cask Strength batch 011, 58.6%**

**Nose:** Huge medicinal peat, sweet creamy vanilla, spice zing, citrus, tropical fruits, caramel, butterscotch, toasted wood, sweet char

**Taste:** Huge medicinal peat, sweet char, peppery spice, big creamy vanilla, bright citrus, tropical fruits, butterscotch, sweet toasted wood. Still a massive peat bomb, some sweet creamy and fruity notes come through along with all the oak

**Finish:** Huge creamy medicinal peat and sweet sweet vanilla icing, spice, sweet char. A long finish that lingers with peat, spice, and sweet vanilla char

**********************************

What an amazing Scotch. We need to just take a moment to appreciate how blessed we are to have this as a regular release from Laphroaig. These two batches have their differences but both are fantastic. In a nutshell, batch 006 is more oaky than 011. It's darker in color, has more vanilla and caramel and charred barrel notes. But 011 is still massive and peaty. It uses it's lighter oak profile to it's advantage, some delicious fruits and sugary sweetness comes through, but still with plenty of burly oak notes don't get me wrong. Both are huge medicinal peat bombs with lots of vanilla and sweet oak. In my opinion it's some of the best peated Scotch that money can buy, and some of the best Whisky out there in general

005 and 006 were definitely the oak phase. Seemed like they were trying to make batch strength QC, which really wasn‚Äôt my jam.
Nice review and interesting notes but it's hardly even a competition, they're both so good!

Sadly there can't be many bottles of batch 6 left in the world.
I cracked open my cask strength bottle last night and I was pretty impressed with it. It's only my second peated scotch, but it had a different type of peat flavor than the Talisker.
Very nice review. I would be very interested in what you think of batch 11 vs. 12 and 13. It‚Äôs a tough call but I personally rank those three 11<13<12 (unfortunately I doubt I‚Äôll ever get to try #6).
Must have used a higher proportion of first fill bourbon casks in the 006 as opposed to more refills in the 011
Did you perform your tasting un diluted?
I miss my bottle of batch 11, super complex whisky and I'd often get lots of different notes each sip. I wasn't able to catch a bottle of batch 12 since we had a huge shortage where I live, but I currently have batch 13 and I'm not quite as happy with it was I was with the 11.
I wonder how you tasted both scotches.

I also love peat - from my first Laphroaig, I couldn't get enough of it! I enjoyed the Laphroaig 10, the Triple Wood, the Lore, and many other islay scotches from other distilleries. I was super excited when I picked up the Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength, but when I first tasted it, I couldn't quite grasp how much I *didn't* like it. I was so confused about not liking it, so I asked around and someone suggested letting it breathe in the glass for at least 10 minutes before drinking, and after trying that, I can say that the Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength is in my top 2 bottles I've ever tasted!
How funny, I just want more 006. Different strokes for different folks!
It's okay, 12 is better :-)!
That would be fun! Unfortunately I dont keep up that much with every single release like that
Yeah, that was my thought as well
Yes. I rarely add water to spirits, usually only on an attempt to help something that I dont totally enjoy
Yes, it can be very important to let a whisky breathe in the glass for a bit. Especially on a newly opened bottle, and especially with cask strength stuff. Glad you came around on it! I'm a peat head like you and laphroaig was love at first sip for me too
I wondered how come I tend to like a scotch less on the first sips and much more as the glass empties, I had just figured it was my palate getting used to it but sounds like it was the breathing. Will do this more often!! Cheers for the tip.
For sure. I don‚Äôt think our notes are that far apart, just different preferences. 

http://cocktailchem.blogspot.com/2016/08/whisky-review-laphroaig-10-year-cask.html
Think so? Hmmm it's definitely good. Haven't tried 13 or 14 yet but I've heard 12 comes out on top of those. Hard to get tho, had to get mine at auction.
Well, I can tell you that my wife certainly hopes I will grow out of it! I bought my first bottle of Laphroaig 10 (also my first bottle of scotch) about a year ago and it turned me into a bit of a fanatic.
My father-in-law introduced me to peat (as well as scotch itself). After my first taste of Laphroaig, which I think was the Triple Wood, I had a hard time drinking anything but islay scotches for about a year and a half. Still love smoke and peat, but thankfully, my taste buds have been open to other things as well now!
Tell your wife to get used to it, because it only gets worse haha"

Scotch review #271

************

**Laphroaig Cairdeas 2021 PX Cask Strength, 58.9%**

**Nose:** Thick, dark, rich and peaty. Rich dark wood, heavy brooding peat, vanilla, phenolic and charred, chocolate, smooth dark fruits, black cherry, raspberry, sweet strawberry, charred wood. A lot of signature Frog Bourbon barrel peat/vanilla but the dark fruity sherry notes creep in beautifully

**Taste:** Dark sherry shows up well-balanced, raspberry, black cherry, huge chocolatey Frog peat, big bourbon barrel notes of dark chocolate, dark toasted wood, vanilla. Dark fruity sherry and heavy peat melds thick and huge. Lots of thick Bourbon barrel notes, it's almost like a fruit-soaked version of the 10 Cask Strength.

**Finish:** Sweet raspberry and cherry, vanilla, dark toasted wood, smooth peat, spice. Sweet fruits, vanilla and peat linger a long time

**************

One of the better Cairdeas releases in quite some time. I have been getting tired of the Cairdeas line after a lot of lackluster releases, which hurts because Laphroaig is some of my favorite Scotch and I used to get excited about these. I think wine influence just doesn't work a lot of times with Laphroaig. But the peat and wood shines in this, complimented with a nice dark and brooding sherry sweetness. It all melds rich and smooth. Not hot or overly sweet or wine-y. Just dark fruit-soaked Laphroaig peat. As always I don't think I can say it's any better than the 10 year Cask Strength, but it's a great bottle if you are looking for something different from the distillery

I absolutely adore this bottle and wish I bought two. It was gone in a flash where I live. The deeply smoky, rich and musty notes on it are just perfect. Almost 59% and doesn't need a single drop of water. Probably my favorite bottle of the year.
[deleted]
I wanted to get this really badly when it was released in BC, but it sold it too quickly. Of course, it was up on Craigslist later the same day at 2x the price
> Lots of thick Bourbon barrel notes, it's almost like a fruit-soaked version of the 10 Cask Strength.

This one sounds good. I too haven't been too crazy about the last few Cairdeas's. They are ok but feel a little too engineered. ( great review BTW)
[deleted]
[](/tom)
How funny, overwhelming wine influence has actually been my complaint with other Cairdeas but not this one so much. 2016 madeira and 2020 port was like that for me, ended up gross and sweet. This one does have a pretty big sherry influence, but for me it balanced well and there was still a lot of vanilla bourbon barrel notes. Everyone's tastes are gonna be different though.
I would agree with you, that the wine cask influence is much stronger on the PX Cask, almost to a fault. I found the Port and Wine version to be perfectly balanced.
I‚Äôm waiting for someone to review a 50/50 mix of this with 10 year CS.  Find the right addition of sherry to the classic 10 profile
Wow, what state are you in? Easy to find in NJ and PA.
As good as it was, I will say that I'm not super keen on buying a bottle. I have 2 different batches of the 10CS open right now, and it's hard to want anything more. It's simply some of the best Scotch that money can buy
Agreed 2019 was a great one, but imo it's been the only memorable cairdeas since 2015. I hated the 2020 port/red wine, bottle is still in my cabinet 

It might just be my personal preference too. I don't think laphroaig does all that well with wine. Bourbon barrel frog is best frog, and the 10CS soundly beats just about any cairdeas for me
BC, Canada. Great place, but the worst when it comes to buying scotch
I agree with you on the Laphroaig CS - just a super good, bourbon cask aged whisky. I've been shying away from the sherry cask finished ones as of late. The base spirit just seems to be getting lost. An example is a Cadenheads, Benrinnes 11 year old I've been working thru, https://www.binnys.com/spirits/scotch/cadenheads-benrinnes-year-old-unchillfiltered-120385. Very tastee but hard to find the Benrinnes base profile - lots of sweet but not a lot of base spirit. I'm still favoring just nice bourbon cask aged ones. Cheers!
Agreed, I love bourbon cask. Although that Benrinnes does look like an interesting mix of casks don't blame you for giving it a go. Speaking of Bourbon cask Laphroaig, I recently took a chance on a doozy. Bought a 1989 32 year Laphroaig IB from K&L for $300, pretty sure it's this one  https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/185830/islay-single-malt-scotch-whisky-1989-pst

It's a weird pre-order thing that K&L does so I won't have it until next year. Very risky but too good of a price to pass up, hope I didn't make a huge mistake haha
It was interesting but too much like just sweet whisky? Sometimes you just have to take a chance. I think you made the right call on that 32 year old Laphroaig, tbh.  That looks good."

**Nose:** Big musty oak, creamy caramel, brown sugar, candy cherry, strong mint, milk chocolate, spice zing that is sharp and bold yet balanced. I Love Love Love this nose, big creamy oak and cherry but with just enough spice zing to know it's a Four Roses

**Taste:** This drinks freaking great. Explosion of big sweet candy cherry and clean toasted oak, sharp cutting spice, creamy caramel, brown sugar, mint. The big candy cherry, clean oak and creamy caramel are vibrant and bold and work together beautifully. The sharp minty spice cuts right through it all and wakes you up, but stops just short of feeling too intrusive or hot. Delicious and so dang drinkable at 59% 

**Finish:** Looong sweet finish of big delicious herbal spice, mint, brown sugar, sweet caramel, clean bold toasted wood.

********************

As a huge fan of Four Roses Private Selects I've had many, many different barrels and this is easily one of the best I've ever had. All the flavor just falls into place perfectly while still keeping  that big vibrant feel that I love in high proof Four Roses. I don't know if I've ever had one with this much candy sweetness and creamy caramel before, but damn do I love it. When I got a chance to try some I was really hoping I wouldn't enjoy it this much. I was hoping it would help me feel better about missing out on a bottle in the lottery. But this is a killer barrel

Great review. This is probably the best bourbon I've ever had, though I'm no hardcore seasoned bourbon drinker. I found that candy cherry note and it sent it up into all time favorite category for me. It's bloody amazing. There's not a single nit I could find to pick about it. Still can't believe I was lucky enough to get a bottle lol
Thanks! And yeah, same
How do you get one?
There's a signup for the email on the sidebar, you get an email to sign up for the lottery when a barrel comes out. If you get selected you get a link to purchase the bottle
Sign up [here](https://westspirits.com/private-selections/) and peep the FAQ and you'll be good to go!
Sign up for the mailing list in the sidebar
This is likely due to it selling 5 weeks ago, and not due to the current state of your luck and or standing with the universe.
Save the salt for r/tequila
Gotta stay on top of those emails :)

**L'Encantada Domaine Lous Mouracs 1983 35 year, Lincoln Road pick, 48.6%**

**Nose:** Dank dark wood, dark syrupy cherry, vanilla, toffee, thick chocolate, layer of minty spice under the chocolatey oak, dank fruity grape, mild tannic wood. Thick and powerful nose, very woody and very sweet. Amazing

**Taste:** Big dense wood, slightly dry, rich caramel, chocolate, soft fruity grape, light rancio, soy sauce, mellow tannic wood. It's a dry and tannic type wood but with a very smooth presentation, and well balanced by lots of sweetness and rich chocolatey/caramel notes. An effortless and thick complexity to it

**Finish:** The smooth dry oakiness builds huge, chocolate, caramel, mellow dark grape, leaves with a pleasant dry tannic feel and sweet vanilla

***********

This is fantastic, a whole other league from the previous 2 Mouracs I tried. The 79 was another favorite of mine, which also happened to be lower abv like this one (compared to the 53% casks that I wasn't as big on). So maybe they just don't do as well at a higher abv, the 87 and 92 were a bit too hot after all. I don't think it's a cellar thing because this one is wet while the 79 was dry. Or just different eras. I dunno. This stuff is a great woody-sweet armagnac

Can you really tell the difference between wet/dry aged?  Serious question.
This one is about as good as it gets for me. I bought way too many of these and will be happy to drink them over a lifetime.
Same rating I gave it at first (more or less)‚Ä¶ and it kept growing on me
Some people apparently can, I've heard that they each can have their own characteristics. But it's not something I've payed close enough attention to. I was just theorizing about possible differences between wet and dry cellar Mouracs
i absolutely think you can. wet cellars can impart some funky, dank, or ‚Äúdusty‚Äù aromas and flavors. the dry chai, on the other hand, can sometimes be sharper or more punchy on the front palate IMO.
That‚Äôs cool.  I‚Äôve read some on this but it sounds like something so nuanced it‚Äôs be tough to pick out.  Can you recommend a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù example of wet vs dry aged?  I‚Äôd like to do a side by side for science!
Actually K&L has a pair of cognacs of same vintage, one aged wet and one aged dry. I can‚Äôt speak to the juice quality, but if you are looking simply to compare for ‚Äúscience‚Äù (or run a sample split with buddies) it‚Äôs a fine opportunity. https://m.klwines.com/Products?searchText=Comandon%20cellar"

**Nose:** Orange citrus, toffee, sweet toasted oak, dank wood, big minty spice, big sweet cherry, vanilla. Nice balance of toasted wood and sweet bright fruits all with a healthy dose of numbing minty spice. Feels lively but oaky and measured

**Taste:** Sweet syrupy caramel, orange citrus, hot cherry, toasted wood, vanilla, sweet grape, bold minty spice. Bright sweet fruits and caramel toasted oak, with a bold spice kick

**Finish:** Bright sweet grape and caramel, musty wood, big blast of sweet spice. Nice finish of sweet fruits and spice

*********************

Much better than the previous 1992 Mouracs I reviewed. It has a similar bright sweetness that balances well with the oak. Flavor is more full, and while there is some spice heat I think it's more tame. Although I actually went back and forth on the heat here. It would feel drinkable, and then too hot. I still don't feel totally resolved haha, so it's walking a line. But luckily there's enough flavor backing it up unlike the 92 which felt a little flat. My only previous experience with Mouracs is the legendary 79, which is so much different than these. It's been a while but I remember it being a dark sludgy oak bomb. These are so bright and spicy even if they do still have lots of nice oak.

**L'Encantada Domaine Lous Mouracs #23, 1992 27 year, Rochester Elite Barrel Pickers, 53.1%**

**Nose:** Toffee, graham crackers, sweet toasted wood, orange citrus, menthol spice, vanilla, smooth warm grape. Sweet wood, warm and balanced, delicious nose

**Taste:** Sweet and hot. Hot cherry, spice, thin caramel, sweet oak, vanilla, musty wood, light chocolate, bright cherry and fruity grape sweetness intertwined with the heavy sweet wood. Some woody bitterness and a fair amount of spice heat. It's mostly good, but flavor feels a little watered down next to the heat of the higher abv. 

**Finish:** Sweet caramel and wood, sweet syrupy cherry, vanilla, lots of spice that builds, leaves hot and cherry-sweet

**************

The nose is amazing, and lots of really nice sweet oak notes with sweet friendly fruitiness on the palate. For being 53% the flavor feels a little watered down, yet it still has all the heat of the high abv. The result is an Armagnac that is good but just a little rough around the edges. Similar to how I feel about Pellehaut, which is a bargain at under $100 but I'll bet this one sold for more. Enjoyable in a hot and fierce kind of way while still having some pleasantly sweet flavor. I never experimented with adding water but it could possibly help here.

Brandy review #70

*************

**L'Encantada Domaine Lous Pibous #123L, 1993 28 year, 55.1%**

**Nose:** Powerful, dense. Dark oak, dark chocolate, big bold cherry with a bubble-gum sweetness, toffee, tobacco, lots of vanilla, wood spice. Such a delicious nose. Dark and dense with big sweet cherry and vanilla

**Taste:** Big feisty oak, black cherry, big burst of sweet cherry syrup, caramel, dark chocolate, nice tannic wood, vanilla, lively wood spice. It feels dark but there's also tons of vibrant spice and sweetness here. Dense and really cohesive but with lots complexity at the same time. So good

**Finish:** Charred oak and vanilla, lively spice, sweet caramel, hot cherry. Leaves with Bourbony spicy oak and cherry type notes, but with that bigger Armagnac sweetness

***************

There is obviously some hype around this domaine, and I like to think I don't get caught up in that type of stuff. But there's just no denying how spectacular this is. After trying most of the Encantadas available on FineDrams I think this Pibous is on another level. Tons of huge flavor at the high abv, yet it has a very cohesive and finished feel compared to the more wild ""IB Scotch"" character of many of the other Encantadas. Not that I'm complaining, those are fun too. But this just feels so well-crafted. It's an Armagnac that I feel has earned it's hype status. 

All that being said, it's not the end-all of armagnac. It's great for a more feisty style, but I still love other yaks that are more smoothly balanced with maybe bolder/richer grape or heavier-aged wood and tannic notes. The big heavy ones with insane amounts of depth. There's all kinds of great stuff out there but I can see why this one has really appealed to Bourbon drinkers (such as myself, ngl).

Saved the heavy hitter for last?

Great finish to a fantastic series, this sounds very much in line with other Pibous I've seen reviewed. Seems that it's lacking the grape/prune thing that is such a calling card of armagnac which is maybe why it's so appealing for its similarities to bourbon?

I guess the real question is do I order 2 bottles...?
Nice list here u/buckydean.  Thanks for managing to sample through all 10!  Really making a sacrifice for all of us. /s
How do you feel about this one vs the grosperrin 1996 ?  The latter is still the best spirit Ive tasted!
Damn this is now sold out.
sigh, just ordered.  Would have been disappointed if I had missed out.
Yep haha, figured it would be fun to save this one for last. Decisions, decisions. I miiight have gotten 2 myself fwiw. I think it's the big oak on this stuff, the big punchy flavor, and the high abv that appeals to Bourbon drinkers so much, and along with all the huge armagnac sweetness it just really works.
Hard to compare them, they are different kinds of profiles but I would very much put this in the same league as the afish 1996 Grosperrin quality-wise and enjoyment-wise. This Pibous is brighter and spicier, 96 is a nice chocolatey rasberry rancio thing
Yeah, it was predictably the first to go. Pibous is a hot ticket these days
This me next week
Ugh I had 2 in my cart and now they‚Äôre sold out
Cool.  Thanks, really value your reviews and opinions by the way.

************

**L'Encantada Domaine Artigaux #10, 1999 22 year, 48.9%**

**Nose:** Toasted wood, maple, coffee, bold sweet cherry, baking spices, red licorice, tart berry, floral sweetness. Toasted, bold and fruity with some interesting sharp licorice, berry and spice that attacks in a fun way

**Taste:** Maple, hot cherry and spice, toasted wood, caramel, graham cracker, red licorice, anise, some tannic wood notes, baking spices. Complex with some really fun flavors. Lots of sweet cherry and red licorice. It leans slightly on the brash side but in a fun way, doesn't feel too hot. Well-balanced by the nice maple toasted wood

**Finish:** Herbal spice and bright cherry, anise, sweet toasted wood, vanilla. Lingering sweet woody spice

***********

Another unique yak from a lesser-known Domaine that works well. Lots of sweetness, some sharp and jarring flavors like licorice and tart berry with lots of complex spice, big bold yak wood and fruitiness. Complex and fun. It has a nice brashness that doesn't get too hot at the lower abv. This is my first Artigaux, and of the three on FineDrams it's the only one that I got to sample. And I like it!

Any specific rationale for the order in which you‚Äôre sampling these?
Appreciate it! Will likely pick one up once the new releases from PM Spirits come out in December. New York as well as import into other states will get some new L‚Äôencantadas.
Don‚Äôt hype any others. I placed my order today.
u/buckydean love the reviews! Fun to see someone review so many things I like or am interested in between bourbon, rye, cognac, and armagnac! 

I am wanting to snag a yak for myself as a present and trying to spend less than 140usd shipped from either cognacexpert or finedrams. 

Two of my favorite (based on reviews, mainly yours lol) would be #635 Jean-Luc Pasquet Cognac Tr√©sors de Famille ""Claude"" Lot 84, 49.8%, and #607 L'Encantada Le Freche #48, 1990 31 year, 52.1%. Some of my favorite bourbons are Russell's 13, Stagg Jr, W.L.W, Weller FP, 107, ORVW, Calumet 15, Smokewagon UCUF, etc

That being said this L'encantada Artiquax is on FD still I believe

Knowing all that and based on your experience, what would give the most bang for the buck that is bolder, good spice, dark fruits, oaky, a big complex, and longer finish? Say the Eagle Rare 17, Old Rip Van Winkle,Russell's 13, remus V style ?

&#x200B;

Anyways, keep up all the good reviews because I will keep reading them! Cheers!
A little, but not anything strict. I'm trying to space out the heavy-hitters like cassou and freche whose profiles I'm more familiar with, so that I'm comparing all the new domaines to them instead of to each other. But I'm basically looking at my samples and deciding what I feel like drinking that night. And I decided a few samples in that I would probably save pibous for last.
Oh man sorry, I've got Pibous coming up it's the hype finale. What did you get?
Howdy, thanks for the kind words! I have a lot of fun doing reviews and it's always nice to hear when people find them helpful. Always down to help with a recommendation as best I can.

Right off the bat I'll say I haven't had the last 4 you listed, and I don't know much about them. Hontambere's younger stuff might be their own distillate and not necessarily the legendary Pouchegu stuff that they bottle under the same name, although I'm not sure what the age cutoff is for that switch. Giboin is generally great, a warm caramel-heavy style of Cognac, but I can't speak to that 2001 vintage from CognacExpert. The JLP Familie bottlings tend to be great but I don't know what the profile on that particular one is. Those late 80's/early 90's Grosperrin Cognacs are great, tend to be a more fruity and creamy style, sometimes an aromatic dry wood. More like the Claude than the other stuff you listed. Le Freche will be a difficult profile to recapture, it's one of the best out there 

I think the afish Giboin 2002 is the all around best, lots of big fruit and bold toasted wood. It's rich in a smooth and warming way, very satisfying. The 96 Truau isn't as good as the afish Giboin, but it's still tasty and it will give you that fiercer Armagnac kick: Darker wood and fruits, tannic, spicey.

It's been a long time since I had the Artigaux 99, but from my notes it sounds like I enjoyed the Truau 96 more. Artigaux 99 sounds like more fruity and bright and floral, and Truau 96 has the stronger wood notes you are looking for. Also better bang for your buck since the Artigaux 99 is only 500ml

Also consider Marquestau, it's really nice for dark wood and heavy vanilla. I absolutely loved the 2001 and went through my bottle quick. I've heard great things about 1994. Don't be worried about the lower abv they drink great

Another ringer is [this Grosperrin 96 Armagnac](https://www.armagnac.de/products/zn09-grosperrin-022023-50?_pos=1&_psq=gros&_ss=e&_v=1.0) (review [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brandy/comments/17dyrez/review_782_grosperrin_zn09_ssmurai_basarmagnac/)). Only a 500ml, and their shipping is pricey although it should still come within your limit. But it's upper tier stuff. Closest I've ever come to the famous afish 96, it may even be from the same domaine although no one knows for sure.

Thank you! Got a bottle of 01 Marquestau at home. It is real good for the price. I wish it was not as easy of a sipper, more spice and longer finish would be perfect lol
Interesting selection, definitely have some different kinds of profiles in there. The bellair, freche and pibous are 3 of my favorites of the whole lineup.
How was the 1986 Artigaux? Have a friend thinking of getting one
also ordered Grosperrin 1988 Fins Bois Cognac (Lot N¬∞235) and Bertrand BdF2 Cognac - Legacy Brandy
That's a good size selection!  I got the 89 LaSalle and 90 freche a few weeks back.  Not disappointed at all!

Brandy review #68

*************

**L'Encantada Domaine De Mamoulens #12, 1993 28 year, 50.2%**

**Nose:** Thick antique wood, smoothly toasted, toffee, tobacco, smooth tannins, chocolate, subdued mellow grape, vanilla. Such a smooth rich woodiness to it

**Taste:** Like the nose it's quite woody but in a smooth kind of way. Smooth toasted wood, toffee, dry tannins, antique wood, sweet vanilla, soft woody caramel. Warm grape fruitiness melds in effortlessly. It has a dusty Bourbon kind of woody profile, where the oak is heavy but well-balanced and smooth. Somewhat dry but no tannic bite or harshness to it at all. Rich flavor but still friendly at 50%

**Finish:** It keeps going with a smooth dry woody finish, soft oak and caramel, tobacco, mild spice, sweet vanilla, subdued gentle grape beneath the surface

*********************

Another delicious Encantada. Rich and oaky. It could almost pass for a Cognac but it's not quite dry enough, the wood and fruits have that Armagnac warmth and richness to them even if I wouldn't quite call it bold. It seems like the more popular domaines such as Cassou, Le Freche, and Pibous tend to have more of that big bold fruit and oak character that appeals to Bourbon drinkers, which is delicious don't get me wrong but I'm really liking how unique these lesser-known bottlings are. If you are looking for that bigger dramatic bold flavor you might find this boring. But if you appreciate a smoother woody yak that still has some nice flavor at 50% it's delicious. Definitely worth the price it's going for

Yay, one of the bottlings in my cart!

Seems like this is definitely an oak forward, though not oak intense, offering. I would've wanted a bit more dynamic fruits but still good to know
Love the journey. You are at my pocketbook's helm
I will probably add it to my order fwiw. It's delicious but I could see it being the kind of profile people aren't necessarily looking for in an Armagnac like you say
Well I think armagnac doesn't have a huge amount of style visibility, so I actually do think this is an armagnac style some people want, even if they don't know it. I imagine the oak/fruit bombs are more appealing because it's such a dramatic departure from the person's normal drink (say bourbon or scotch). Because it's so bold it's easy to love.

But as we go further down the rabbit hole it's learning what you want for different moods. And it's gotten to the point now that there's products competing for the same mood. If I wanted a big, rich, brooding experience would I grab Glendronach 18 or any one of these armagnacs? The yaks are more affordable in many ways! 

I wanted to grab the Pibous because it's generally highly regarded but this, and the '98 Cassou seem like a great stylistic counterbalance. And I've been on a yak kick over scotch lately.
> And I've been on a yak kick over scotch lately.

Boy do I feel this haha. And yes I agree. There was definitely a certain bold and punchy style that initially hooked me, but now that I'm diving further into it it's fun having different kinds of profiles."

**************

**L'Encantada Domaine Del Cassou #10, 1987 34 year, 48.6%**

**Nose:** Sweet dark cherry wood, sweet and deeply toasted, caramel, chocolate cherry, gentle wood spice, tons of vanilla. A wonderful nose, big sweet Cassou fruitiness melds with the deep caramel oak beautifully

**Taste:** Big sweet creamy caramel, deep sweetly toasted oak, cherry syrup, sweet grape, wood spice. Big sweet flavor, lots of oak but it's all sweetly toasted and caramelized with no tannic bitterness or rancio. It's that bold yet agreeable fruity Cassou style, smoothed out and oaked up. So good

**Finish:** The sweet toasted oak and big caramel pops bright and sweet with some pleasant spice, a hint of bitter wood, delicious grape, and some bourbony type oak on the tail end

**************

Like I said in my previous review of the other Cassou, I'm a big fan of this domaine. And also like that other Cassou, this one does not disappoint. It has kept it's fruity and creamy style intact well, with lots of added oak. But there's no heavy tannins or spice, doesn't have that heavy-aged ""old"" oakiness to it. Just more deep caramel and sweet toasted wood, melding beautifully with the big sweet fruitiness. Just a touch of bitterness and tannins on the finish that gives it some extra complexity. Really enjoyed this one

**P.S.** I saved a bit of each FineDrams Cassou to drink side by side, and what a treat they both are. It's really hard to pick a favorite. They are different enough styles that it's hard to compare. The 98 does great with it's youthfulness, the fruits are bolder and tons of creamy butterscotch. This 87 is great for it's darker oak notes, although I still wouldn't call it oak heavy. 87 might win by a fraction, it does it's style a tad better than the 98 does it's style. I feel like I'm nitpicking though both are delicious

I'm a big fan of Cassou so I was excited for these two bottlings, and this one does not disappoint. Cassou just always feels so right. It has a style of big delicious fruitiness and clean toasted oak that feels effortless and delicious. This one has a nice creamy butterscotch element to it as well, similar to the Hail Yak Cassou from what I remember of it(which makes sense, this is the same vintage and almost the exact same abv as the Hail Yak). It's a profile that I've found unique to Cassou so far and it's so good

Fantastic review, had my eye on this since the Hail Yak was before my time.

It's great that this and the 34yr are both available. You said the '87 edges it out but I feel like this' 98 Cassou has a more standout profile against some of the other yaks on offer. It's not as oak heavy so I imagine it makes for a nice companion against Pibous or Lasselle
Yes, 98 definitely wins points for it's unique style and probably evens things out. Since posting the review I've learned that this Finedrams cask #43 is actually a sister cask for the Hail Yak, which was #44. So it's no wonder they are so similar."

Brandy review #65

*************

**L'Encantada Domaine Larege #12, 1996 25 year, 44.1%**

**Nose:** Immediate impression is that it's Bourbony, like a light smooth Bourbon. Toasted wood, cherry, caramel, spice, vanilla. With some air, smooth grape-drink fruitiness does open up in there too. It's basic, but well balanced and inviting

**Taste:** Dry wood, light caramel, vanilla, slightly bitter. Smooth and balanced, a monotone kind of flavor of delicate dry/woody caramel with just a bit of sweet cherry, gentle fruits and light spice. Pleasant, but it comes in a flash and doesn't offer much depth or complexity.

**Finish:** More sweetness and fruits come out in the finish, candy cherry, fruity grape, sweet caramel, pleasantly light spice

***************

It's basically pleasant but just falls a little short. It's a shame because it's a delicious nose, and some nice flavor does pop on the finish, but the mouthfeel and flavor is just lacking. Not bad and it might have even been a good beginner's yak for someone not used to drinking spirits neat but it's too expensive for that. I dig that sweet and balanced Bourbon-like quality it has though so might still be worth checking out other expressions in the future.

American Whiskey review #247

*************

**Barrell ""Seagrass"" Rye, 59.65%**

**Nose:** Not sure what I was expecting exactly, but this is very clean and polished. Clean sharp Rye grain, indeed it is a little grassy even, butterscotch, citrus, pine, green apple, some balanced tropical fruits, peppery rye spice, a bit of caramel-toasted wood.

**Taste:** Sweet butterscotch, clean bright Rye grain that pops, citrus, green apple, bright happy tropical fruits, clean rye spice, with some air the apricot even comes through really nice. Like the nose it's a bit of a surprise, not a cacaphony of flavor at all considering all the crazy barrels involved. It feels clean and polished, bright and happy

**Finish:** Sweet apricot and caramel, zingy peppery Rye spice, grassy rye grain, syrupy butterscotch, leaves sweet and fruity and spicy.

*************

I was kind of expecting this to be a mess considering all the barrels involved, but that's not the case at all. It almost just feels like an especially fruity Rye, except the apricot and bright tropical fruits start to reach impossible heights for a standard Rye. Nothing ever gets too heavy at all though, overall it feels very clean and polished and still very much a Rye. I came in skeptical and I gotta say I'm impressed!

Cheers!
Great review and on point.  Seagrass has become my go-to when I tire of the ""typical"" bourbon profile and want to spice it up; it used to be High West Campfire prior to Seagrass coming along.

BUT with all these positive reviews and accolades I have seen for Seagrass recently, I have a sinking feeling that it will probably be the top whiskey for 2021 as named by sites like Breaking Bourbon, and we all know what happened to the previous winners Stagg Jr. (2019) and Knob Creek 12yr (2020).  Perhaps I'm wrong but I really doubt it, time will tell I suppose...
Just picked up a bottle today and can't wait to try it. I'm very curious if I'll be able to decipher anything you did.
Either my #1 or #2 Rye. Too close to call.
Growing up,  my moms friend had that same painting of the monkey drinking. I always tried to buy it,  but she'd never budge.
I‚Äôve been wanting to see a review of this.  Well done review and I can‚Äôt wait to get a bottle of it myself
I‚Äôve been wondering about this one and now I want a bottle. Great review!
Nice review!
depends on your personal preference.  When I first tried it I couldn't tell if I liked it or not.  

It was so different from what I usually drink (I'm more of a RR or ECBP guy), but I started to really enjoy the sweetness and heavy fruit flavor of this. I can see some folks disliking this.
Ha, everyone is different. I will say I didnt like the first few pours as much, but not because of the reasons you listed. It was just a bit closed
>  It seemed like a sweet rye funky brandy shit show to me. 3/10

Lol, I can see that interpretation.  I have had this bottle for a couple of months now and I'm getting towards the end.  When I first had the flavors I was picking up were all over the place.  After a couple of months it has mellowed out quite a bit.  Hopefully some time and air will make it more palatable for you.
I see where you are coming from as I felt the same way on my first bottle. However, I feel like this is one you need to let sit for 10 minutes or more before it opens up. Not a fan on first pour, but giving it that time makes this one special to me.
Is Barrell going to make this a regular release? Seems like it might be difficult to recreate with all the barrels involved, but who knows
Look for the bright fruits! The citrus and tropical notes and green apple, and the apricot on the tail end and finish, are what make this fun
I finally tried a bottle.  It's fantastic.  It doesn't quite measure up to the magical (and cheap) bottles of old scout rye from 6 or 7 years ago, but I am glad I bought more than 1!
there's been at least 2 or 3 per week for a few weeks, now.
Well thank you!
Its called STELLUM; the rye is amazing
Believe it is intended to be a regular release similar to Dovetail where they will just continue to release new batches.  Agree, it will be interesting to see what level of consistency they will be able to maintain.  I have batch 1 and get a lot of similar notes to your review above.  It looks like you have batch 2.
Oh wow I had no idea there were different batches even, thanks for the info
I didn't either until this informative post.  Basically look all the way to the right where the blue meets the green seagrass design.

Brandy review #64

************

**L'Encantada Domaine De Bellair #12L, 1974 47 year, 45.3%**

**Nose:** Unsurprisingly (given the age), it's quite woody. Dark tannic wood, dry and mildly bitter, light rancio, sweet tobacco, soy sauce, antique wood furniture, but there's also lots of sweet toasted notes and caramel, vanilla, dark brooding grape, wood char. 

**Taste:** A sweet mingling of dark wood and fruity grape. Dark and sweetly toasted, dry bitter wood, rancio, caramel, mild wood spice, charred and sweet toasted oak, vanilla. Has the dark tannic oak you would expect in something this old but also with some sweetness and nice fruity grape. Mouthfeel is light and agreeable with delicious flavor. It's all extremely well balanced and wrapped up in a nice little drinkable 45% package

**Finish:** Mouth-puckering rancio and dry tannic oak but it stays friendly, dark toasted wood, sweet grape, wood spice. Lingering soy sauce and sweet grape

*************

My first Bellair and boy I love it. This is a lot better than just a tannic oak bomb. It does have some nice dark tannic notes and rancio but they stay mellow and there's still lots of sweetness and fruity grape to be found. Very well-balanced between all these notes. It's a bit light at 45% but gives it a nice drinkable feel. This one is a winner for that old tannic kind of profile

Just want to say thanks for reviewing these, it's nice to have another data point in addition to the product notes on [FineDrams.com](https://FineDrams.com) since I'm still figuring out what's going to be in my next order... :)
Soy sauce! That‚Äôs what I couldn‚Äôt quite identify!
I know that armagnac producers will rerack into less active barrels but it still amazes me that a 47yr spirit exists, is tasty, and is relatively affordable
Such a unique experience. I enjoy this barrel. It is balanced like you said. Can't wait to share with others. ü•É
Just bought a bottle of this last week.  Cant wait to try it!
Thanks for the review!
Sure thing, glad you find them helpful! I'm reviewing these from samples, and for the same reasons as you-to figure out what I'm going to order. So I know exactly how you feel haha
Yes! Once you pin down that soy sauce note in old Armagnac it's very apparent. It's one of those kinds of notes that probably sounds gross if you've never had it but works well in an old woody tannic Armagnac
Yeah its pretty amazing that this is almost 50 years old, and is just slipped in with stuff half its age for a similar price
Yes, it was one of my favorites of the whole lineup
I was wondering about how you were tasting these. Do they still sell samples? I remember a couple of years ago they had samples available for many of the L'Encantada bottlings they sold, but they don't seem to anymore.

There are certain domaines I've had before and know I like, but I was curious about some of the new ones from domaines I haven't tried before.  The de Laou√© sounds interesting
I split the bottles among some friends and we all got a little of each one to try, that's why these are all empty in the picture. And yeah I miss those samples, I don't think they do them anymore
Do any Texans have experience buying from [FineDrams.com](https://FineDrams.com)? I used to live in California, and I would buy from K&L Wines. Since I've moved to Texas, it's harder to come by L'Encantada, and apparently Texas does not allow domestic shipping of liquor (or at least K&L Wines won't ship to us).
Finedrams ships everywhere, pretty sure you can get it shipped to texas"

Not oak heavy or bold on the fruits, but still delivers lots of flavor at the abv. Plenty of creamy caramel and sugary sweetness and citrus type notes. Somewhat elegant with just a bit of nice tannic bitterness and spice thrown in. I really like it. For being one of the lower priced and lesser known domaines I think it's really good stuff and a nice example of a younger profile

Dark and lightly bitter but it's balanced by some creaminess and a nice oak sweetness. Fruits are light. Mouthfeel is maybe lacking a little but it's good

**Finish:** Sweet toasted oak, vanilla, bright spice, grape. Lots of happy sweet vanilla oak notes and sweet fruity grape

All the Lassalle I've tried has been quite unique, and this one is right there with them. Some funky mint and coffee and spice notes pop up, complex flavors that really punch through cleanly.

Thanks for doing these. Did you pick up all the available bottles on fine drams? I can‚Äôt decide what ones to order.
Bruh you're not making my Fine Drams cart any less tempting...and it's hard enough only selecting a few of the those L'encantada offerings as it is! I'm born in '93 so I'm eyeing the Pibous and Mamoulens.

I've actually had Lassalle once before, a '79 back when I was only a few years into single malt and knew absolutely nothing about armagnac. It was the closest thing to syrah I had. Tobacco leaf, jam, blackberries, and balsamic reduction. It was lovely and a shame I only had a sample.

Notice any change with water?
Thanks for the review!
I have samples of 10 of the encantada bottles from FineDrams. I've only done 2 so far and I'll be getting to the rest. I can tell you the le freche is really good. Based on past experience pibous and cassou are safe bets but I havent actually tried the ones available on FineDrams yet
Damn, a lassalle with that kind of age on it sounds pretty amazing. Love to try something like that. I don't tend to add water, so I never tried this with any added
Are you sure that 1979 was a Lassalle? I haven‚Äôt seen any pre-1980s.
Thanks. I was thinking Freche, LP, and cassou. I‚Äôm adding lassalle beaded on this review as well.
I don't think the age was much different from this one due to bottling dates. Because the vintage armagnacs are so aged, 31 years in this case, I find that they don't need water to help take the alcoholic edge off but rather untangle the oak. But to each their own!
I stand \*slightly\* corrected  


[https://www.whiskyfun.com/2014/Malternatives-on-Sunday-hourrah-pour-l-Armagnac.html](https://www.whiskyfun.com/2014/Malternatives-on-Sunday-hourrah-pour-l-Armagnac.html)  


Seems some people play loosey-goosey with the name 'Chateau de Lassalle', but this is the one that I had. Not clear on the link between L'Encantada's Lassalle, but it was super enjoyable
Very interesting, thank you!"

**Nose:** A fierce nose of dark toasted wood and bold punchy fruits, sweet fruity grape, some darker burnt fruits, vanilla cherry, plum, creamy caramel, wood spice. The dark oak and fruitiness on this are just beautiful

**Taste:** Big dark toasted oak, caramel, punchy fruits of woody burnt grape and black cherry, bright spice, vanilla, some nice bitter wood notes. Lots of heavy wood but at the same time there's plenty of bold burnt fruitiness. Le Freche hits both ends of the woody/fruity spectrum so well. Punchy flavor but not hot

**Finish:** Sweet grape and dark cherry, dark toasted wood, vanilla, lingering wood spice pleasant woody bitternss

***********

Very much in line with other Le Freche I've tried. Big dark oak and big fruits, it's punchy but all the flavors work well with each other. There's thicker and more smoothly-balanced Armagnacs out there but I find Le Freche very satisfying when I'm looking for that big punchy and vibrant flavor. This one is no exception. Delicious stuff.

Great review as always.  Really need to get some more l‚Äôencantada. 

Are your reviews consolidated anywhere?  Would be a nice reference.  Also I‚Äôd love to see a plot of price vs score and go bargain shopping.
Just orderedü•É
I see the domaine name and immediately think of that South Park episode, but irrelevant name associations aside this sounds intense. One of those spirits that isn't dynamic but has a ton of depth to what it offers.

Your description has shades of the Grosperrin afish pick, how similar are these?
Love this barrel. Big fruit and oak! Deliciousü•É
Got this for xmas. Finally trying it tonight.  

Wow!  Your review is spot on.  Powerful and beautiful stuff.  I could drink this every night and be very happy.
Very nice! Glad you liked this one.
I should have waited!  I have both this one and the LaSalle.  Maybe there's another purchase coming but I'm waiting on all 10 reviews first üòÄ
Appreciate the offer, but no I'm not in New York
Thanks!

>Are your reviews consolidated anywhere?

No they aren't sorry. I just post here on Reddit for fun. It would be nice for my own reference as well, but I'm no good at computer stuff
I haven't had much that is similar to that afish pick honestly. The combination of chocolatey wood and deep fruits and mushroom/soy sauce type notes. This is more of a standard kind of oaky and fruity yak that is very well done
Ha, that basically describes all the Le Freche I've had. A great domaine
Lucky you! This is a great one"

**Nose:** Red fruit, tart berry, bitter oak, cacao, sandalwood incense, caramel, oak spice. There's some nice notes but the weird oak and bitterness makes it feel a little discordant

**Taste:** Bitter oak, tart berry, cocoa, sweet red fruit that is maybe a little harsh, caramel, some perfumy harshness, toasted wood. It has some really nice stuff going on, and I'll start to really enjoy it but then that first sip after waiting a few minutes just feels bitter and discordant all over again. It's not bad but it's confusing

**Finish:** The fruits grow more warm and pleasant, strawberry, cherry, caramel, bitter oak. Leaves darkly sweet and fruity with some nice spice

*****************

This is unique stuff, not quite what I was expecting. Some really nice dark woody fruits and cocoa, but there's some bitterness and harshness there too. It isn't overwhelming but it feels a bit intrusive at times. It's still enjoyable though, and water does help smooth it all out and still keep some character. Overall I enjoyed it but I was hoping for a little better. Might still be worth the low price for the uniqueness of the stuff.

barrel was too wet imo, almost like someone just mixed port straight in
Agree with a lot of your notes, I got loads of spice, chocolate, red fruit. This one is definitely quite different and a little funky from the wine, but improved after being open a few weeks. I keep going back and forth between it being too young and spirity and being well integrated with crystal clear malt backbone standing up to the heavy cask influence
The bitter aspect was less prominent for me. Came off more tart to my palate. But I enjoyed this quite a bit. Like getting slapped with port. Not a perfect marriage by any means. Port matured scotch is more often than not fragmented and few are done well. I don't think I'd say this was done well, but it was done well enough for me to be happy!

**Taste:** Plums, strawberry, blackberry, caramel, menthol char, dark toasted oak, toffee, malt, sweet vanilla, hot oak spice. Lot's of darker caramel and toasted wood, a little hot but balanced by pleasantly sweet fruits. Everything works well together it's tasty. Definitely seems to be some sweet sherry influence here

**Finish:** Zingy oak spice, toffee, malt, sweet toasted oak, vanilla, sweet black licorice char, a hint of sweet strawberry wine. It has a nice spice tingle that carries through and lingers a long time but never feels too hot, I really enjoy it

***************

This stuff is tasty. Healthy wood influence with some darker caramel and a kick of spice. The sherry (that seems to be a part of this) fruitiness is rich and sweet. It has these competing elements but never strays too far in any one direction. I had a suspicion that this would take well to some water, and boy was I right. Calms down the heat and it's like some kind of wood-toasted caramel covered fruit dessert, really nice.

**Taste:** Tastes fresh and clean with a honey richness, a wonderful mouthfeel. Bright sweet barley, vanilla icing, light butterscotch, it has a breezy and effortless fruitiness to it, rich mouth-coating honey, bright tropical fruits, peach, the lightest hint of sulfury cherry wine

**Finish:** Sweet barley and tropical fruits, mild spice, honey, lemon drizzle, descends into darker flavors of mildly tart cherry, brine, lingering root beer char which is unexpected and delicious

************

A beautiful example of a very well-done older Scotch. Older age on a Scotch like this can be a subtle thing, the quality doesn't jump out of the glass and smack you in the face like some people might think. It's more about all the complex flavors that seem to just effortlessly flow together and coat your mouth. Maybe it's hard to put into words, but it just feels so right. All the flavor falls into place right where it needs to be. Any sherry influence here is subtle, although it is definitely more fruity than your average refill bourbon.

I love to see an inactive sherry butt, refill crew represent. Your notes sound fantastic, these old and rare bottles are usually pretty high grade stuff. Cheers!
It was probably a very tired cask they used back in 1987 when this was made. That's not an uncommon thing to do with scotch that is aged this long
Totally haha. Sherry bombs can be nice, but the subtle sherry influence you can get from a refill barrel of short finish can be much more interesting imo"

**Nose:** Barley forward but in a gentle kind of way, light and grassy, cereal malt, lemon, light mineral-y funk, gentle fruits. A nice nose but so quiet and meek

**Taste:** Sweet barley, lemon zest, clean cereal malt, slight tangy funk, mineral flavors, some mellow spice. A little more vibrant fruitiness and spice kicks up compared to the nose but overall stays gentle. It's a light and smooth Scotch, and it doesn't get very sweet like this style sometimes does. Has a dry barley grain quality. Very nice

**Finish:** Spice builds softly giving it a little more action. Bright fruit, tangy lemon zest, sweet barley and cereal malt. A delicious finish, not huge but it caps this gentle malt off nicely with just a touch more vibrant action

***************

Drinkable and delicious, it's maybe a hair too much on the light side but no off notes are to be found here. A perfectly sippable barley-forward malt. Starts a little ho-hum on the nose, palate is nicer, and then the finish is the best part. Not nearly as great as the last Tamdhu 20 year K&L had, a 1998 Old Malt Cask aged in a 1st fill hogshead. That one was special. This one was still tasty and worth the cheap price it went for though.

**Nose:** Sweet barley malt, honey, some smooth easygoing peat, light char, banana funk, floral sweetness

**Taste:** Spirity grain, grassy malt, banana funk, thin butterscotch and caramel, floral, lightly smoky, delicate spice. It's sweet and grain forward, definitely a refill character. A little bit of funk and spirit come through but it stays well-balanced. I think the light smoke adds an interesting element. Not bad but doesn't quite ""wow"" me

**Finish:** peppery spice, floral, sweet grain, some thin caramel and barley sweetness, light spirity funk, just a hint of smoke. Spirity and quick on the finish

*************

It's not quite the ""stunner"" that K&L describes it as imo, but it's some tasty stuff. Can't complain at the $80 it went for. I'll bet this barrel was awful and spirity at 10-12 years old but the age has started to balance it out while keeping the sweet grain-forward character. And the light smoke keeps it from being too boring. Would be disappointed if I paid a premium for it but it's a nice budget bottle as is

**Nose:** Leather, tobacco, minty spice, dark charred and toasted wood, corn, some heat and brashness just under the surface

**Taste:** Big wood spice, sweet corn and cherry, maple, dark toasted wood, leather, tobacco, old wet wood, vanilla, char. It has some big and bright flavor but balanced very well by the dark toasted oak

**Finish:** Sweet vanilla, long lingering wood spice and toasted oak, mint, dark roasted coffee. Long and oaky-sweet

********************

**Blind Sample #2**

**Nose:** Leather, tobacco, chocolate, dark charred toasted wood, mellow layer of minty spice, vanilla

**Taste:** Huge syrupy and oaky mouthfeel, cherry syrup, building wood spice, thick toasted oak, corn, sweet tobacco, char, vanilla. Flavor just keeps building huge

**Finish:** Long finish of wood spice, old dry oak, dark and toasted, some woody cherry, minty spice undercurrent. It feels like all the oak is just building and absorbing into my mouth and tongue

******************

* These are the only two Staggs I've ever had, so I can't say how they compare to other releases but they are very similar to each other. You can definitely tell they are in the same family of bottlings. Not just an oak bomb, there's tons of complexity and flavor that is huge but all balances extremely well in a big hot kind of way. There is one that stands out to me, it's #2 that I like better. The mouthfeel is thicker, more rich oak and less brashness. They are both delicious and very similar, but #2 just feels like a slightly better version of #1. Might just be personal preference though. #1 has a little more bright and dramatic flavor to it, #2 has more chocolate and syrupy thickness. I really love them both.

**Reveal:**

Sample #1: >!George T Stagg 2018, 62.45%!<

Sample #2: >!George T Stagg 2020, 65.2%!<

**Post-Reveal Thoughts:** So 2020 wins today, but not by a lot. Both are great. This was a good one to do blind because I was actually expecting the opposite based on everything I've heard about how great the 2018 is. Interesting too that the 2018 drank hotter to me at a lower abv. Very happy with the results obviously, since I have a full bottle of the winner. As for scoring, it's so close it's barely worth it. I'll say **8.5/10** for the 2018, and **9/10** for the 2020
Hey congrats on 600 reviews Bucky!  Helluva accomplishment! Here's to 600 more! ü•Éü•É
Doin' the Lord's work for us, blinding George T. Stagg vs. George T. Stagg... All kidding aside I've had both and tried to guess the samples based on your tasting notes and they matched! I didn't care for the drying effect on the 2020 and put the 2018 a notch higher, but both bottles are delicious. Like you said, it's hard to really judge these side by side.
Congrats on 600, and a fun set of bourbons to land on 600 for! I've no thad the 2020, but the 2018 is my favorite bourbon to date.
I was lucky enough to to try GTS 2020 at a bar this weekend, fantastic stuff. Congrats on 600!
Cheers to 600!
Just had the 2018 for the first time last week, absolutely loved it.
Great review my friend. And congratulations to 600 :)
Thank you, cheers
Thanks! Yeah it really is fantastic stuff, some of the best I've ever had as well"

Scotch review #265

*********

**Glenfarclas 1992 28 year ""Sovereign"" K&L pick, refill barrel 46.2%**

**Nose:** Delicate malt and honey, custard, light caramel, barley sugar, sugary tropical fruits, faint lemon. Everything about it pleasant and inviting, but quite light

**Taste:** Velvety soft mouthfeel, bright sugar pastry, vanilla pudding, warm pear, honey, light caramel, nilla wafer, very soft spice tingle, sweet bright barley and malt, soft lemon custard. There's some tropical fruits but they come through lightly and you just wish it had a little more body to it. Soft and smooth with an easygoing kind of bright sweetness.

**Finish:** Sugar cookie, vanilla icing, tropical fruits come through bolder, sweet barley malt. A sweet pleasant finish

***********

No real complaints here, all the flavor is delicious and on point. It tastes like refill Bourbon to me, it's odd that they don't specify on the bottle or the write-up considering you associate farclas with sherry. If you're expecting something stunningly epic at the old age it might let you down a little. It could use a little more body, it drinks lighter than many standard Scotch bottlings do at 46%. But hard to complain at the price they sold it at. And it really is delicious, has all the hallmarks of a well-aged Scotch. If you want something super easy and drinkable and on the sweeter malty side it's a winner and (was) worth the price.

**Benrinnes 1997 23 year ""Old Malt Cask"" K&L pick, refill hogshead 58.4%**

**Nose:** Toffee, big toasted oak, maple, warm fruitiness, thick malt, wood spice, vanilla, some sweeter icing type notes just underneath the oak and malt. It's malty but there's lots of really nice oak here too, delicious nose

**Taste:** Big sweet caramel and malt, bright sugary icing, wood spice, sharp meaty sulfur, toffee, smooth toasted wood, vanilla, building wood spice and herbal notes that never get too hot. It's straightforward but very well-executed. Not a malty and spirity grain-forward kind of refill, there's lots of rich caramel toffee and oak here and it's all very well balanced. A deceivingly difficult balance to achieve in a malty Scotch like this

**Finish:** Rich toffee and malt, toasted wood, sweet vanilla icing, root beer char and wood spice that lingers a long time, just beautiful

**************

Loving this stuff. Not your typical old, grain forward kind of refill Bourbon Scotch. There's plenty of caramel and toffee toasted oak here that strikes a beautiful balance. Another winner from this round of K&L selections. Worth every penny that it went for if you were lucky enough to grab one.

**************

**Mortlach 2008 12 year ""Sovereign"" K&L pick, sherry butt 58%**

**Nose:** Big meaty and savory nose, toasted oak, graham cracker, herbal mint, brown sugar, burnt caramel, chocolate-covered cherry, thick meaty sulfur, malt, vanilla, sweet barrel char. What a magical nose, this stuff is ready to rock and roll. It's medicinal and peaty even

**Taste:**The sherry sweetness emerges, sugary plum, strawberry, candy cherry, big pop of sulfury malt and minty spice, thick caramel, charred and toasted wood, bbq pork, gentle wood spice, graham cracker, caramel. Plenty of fruity sweetness but it's balanced out by a lot of delicious graham cracker and caramel type wood, and a hint of darker char. So much better than just a dark sherry bomb, it's super complex and delicious. Just wow

**Finish:** Big pop of bright sugary sweetness, sulfury malt, sweet fruits, wood spice, caramel and sweet vanilla char. A long sweet sweet finish with lots of sugary fruits and malt

**************

This one is a zinger. Wow, just amazing from start to finish. Once again K&L goes for a sherried Scotch that is so much more than just a simple dark and dank sherry bomb. This stuff has tons of huge sweet and savory flavor and it's all delicious, with a compliment of sweet sugary fruit. So complex. This is probably the best Mortlach I've ever had, although I haven't delved into the sherried stuff as much which I hear is quite good. This one is sold out unfortunately, need to find more!

This sounds like a stellar Mortlach and only 12 yo. Damn. These Sovereigns you‚Äôve been reviewing all sound amazing. Great review, thanks for sharing.
This has me excited for the Aberlour 15yr that I preordered from them, it seems like they find some more interesting sherry-driven barrels
Also thought this was amazing. I get straight up BBQ smoked pork among a plethora of fruits. I really hope we see more of this specific profile of Mortlach in the future.
Cool! I think I have a sample of this coming, I'm super excited now. Great review!
I really enjoyed this bottle and regret not getti g another. An absurd value and feels uniquely peated for Mortlach. Much better than the young refill bourbon cask Mortlachs K&L offered the last few seasons.

***************

**Glentauchers 2010 10 year ""Sovereign"" K&L pick, wine barrel 58.3%**

**Nose:** Fruity and malty with rich caramel, red fruits, cherry, plum, tart cherry, thick malt, smooth toasted wood, vanilla. The fruits and malt and rich caramel all meld beautifully like some kind of caramel covered fruit

**Taste:** Caramel, nice zingy spice, chocolate strawberry, tart bitter cherry, a light hint of wine-y sulfur, malt, smooth sweet wood. Not as sweet as the nose but some winey fruit comes through with the rich caramel, with a little more heat and oomph to it on the palate. Well-balanced and Scotchy with a delicious little spice kick

**Finish:**Numbing wood spice and hot cherry builds big, caramel, dark scotchy malt. The dark fruits and spice and sweet wood rides out a long time, it's a really nice finish

************

Really interesting stuff. It's a balanced wine influence, It's fruity but doesn't feel too sweet or wine drenched. The worry for me sometimes is that the wine might take over but this feels very Scotchy and well-crafted still. The spice gives it a delicious little kick without feeling too hot. I added some water, and wow it gets really really good. Spice heat is gone, the luxurious caramel and creamy fruits build. I'm trying this from a 2oz sample and I wish I had a little more to experiment with, because it's really working for me with the water. In any case, with or without water, and like the previous 2 I tried, it's good and easily worth the price that K&L is charging

Scotch review #261

*************

**Linkwood 2002 18 year ""Hepburn's Choice K&L pick, hogshead 53.9%**

**Nose:** Grassy malt, cereal grain, mineraly and oily, caramel, nice roasted nuttiness, barley sugar, lightly balanced floral and citrus notes. Lots of straightforward thick cereal malt with a nice roasted nuttiness and just a hint of funky mineral and yeast, all well-balanced

**Taste:** Caramel, malt, stewed green apple, thick grassy cereal, a hint of funky yeast, mineraly, sweet barley, darker roasted nuts, light sweet oak. Malty, lots of complex cereal notes here with some interesting mineral and roasted flavor, doesn't feel too sweet or grassy or new make-y. Grain forward but balanced in a well-aged kind of way. So smooth at 53%

**Finish:** Some spice kicks up on the finish, bright sweet barley, lemon citrus, sweet chewy caramel. A nice lively finish that brightens up and leaves you satisfied

************

This is really tasty stuff. A good example of what older age can accomplish with a grain forward malty Scotch: effortlessly balanced without sacrificing flavor or mouthfeel. Along with the big cereal notes I like the hint of mineral-y funk and darker roasted nuttiness in here, it all stays well-balanced and gives it some personality. Doesn't feel like the same generic malty Speyside/Highland IB that you've had a thousand other times before. It's not big and flashy, but if you are a fan of well-aged malty Scotch I don't think you will be disappointed. Worth every penny that K&L is charging.

Scotch review #260

****************

**Dailuaine 2010 10 year Sovereign K&L pick, sherry butt 59.4%**

**Nose:** Honey, thick waxy malt, brine, barley sugar, sweet sugared fruits, strawberry, salted caramel, butterscotch, sugar pastry, sweet orange. Very inviting, it has an easy kind of waxy malty thickness and decadent sweetness all gorgeously woven together 

**Taste:** Big flavor from the 59% but not too hot. Sugary barley, waxy and malty, sugar pastry, the fruits are sweet and honeyed and they effortlessly meld with the thick Scotchy malt, an edge of gritty brine and spice, bright citrus. So much thick sweet malt here, the sherry lends a delicate fruit sweetness and isn't winey and dank at all. Feels like a malt bomb with a light sweet sherry finish

**Finish:** Spice and citrus, bright sweet barley, sweet candied fruits and honey, a hint of gritty brine. Long and oily. Bright and sweet malty finish with the beautifully balanced decadent fruit

*************

K&L doesn't specify the type of Sherry butt used here, but it drinks like a refill sherry or light sherry finish. Lots of decadent sweetness from both the barley and the fruit, hard to tell where one ends and the other begins it all melds so well. But a nice thick waxy and oily and briny malt backbone to balance it all out. This is the kind of malty Dailuaine that I love and the sherry compliments it rather than thickly laying over it like a bigger sherry bomb might do. Exactly my kind of style, but if you want a dark sherry bomb look elsewhere.

Sounds delicious. Great review as always. Dailuaine is way overlooked.

These K&L picks seem to be consistently high quality, best modern Bowmore I've ever had was under this label, wish they shipped here.
And thanks, as always! Dailuaine is never overlooked by me haha. I love the stuff. They have such a beautiful malty profile full of character. I've had some that were meh but a lot of really great ones
Agreed. It‚Äôs one I‚Äôm always looking for and will pick up when I see one. I‚Äôve had some stunning bourbon cask ones as well. SCN Did a Sherry cask aged that was (and still is ) quite amazing."

Some interesting aspects to this according the K&L writeup: High quality grains that include their own self-malted barley, open wooden washbacks and double distilling in small copper pots. It also has an unspecified low barrel entry proof and apparently the 50% abv on this is cask strength. Mashbill is 64/21/15 corn/barley/rye

American Whiskey review #244

***************

**Leopold Bros Bourbon 4 year single barrel K&L pick, 50%**

**Nose:** Mellow and refined, brown sugar, nutty, caramel, sweet corn, some young stale wood, thick sweet cereal, berry fruits, vanilla, a very reserved spice tingle and faint mint. Very nice, so mellow and sweet almost Scotchy

**Taste:** Sweet bright Bourbon corn with just a mild zing to it, green apple fruits, nutty caramel, smooth brown sugar, light caramel oak, some livelier minty spice but still stays very reserved and mellow. Like the nose it's almost like a Scotch, except for that more vibrant corn sweetness and mild spice coming through in it's elegant way. Really good stuff and so interesting

**Finish:** Peppery spice builds a little, nothing remotely hot though, caramel, green apple, smooth sweet Bourbon corn, some light sweetly toasted wood

***********

Before drinking this I had the three chamber rye from this same distillery, and once again I'm delightfully surprised by the quality and uniqueness of their stuff. This has to be some of the most Scotchy and smooth Bourbon I've ever had. I'm guessing it's the pot stills? I don't have a lot of experience with pot still Bourbon. Usually it takes age to mellow a Bourbon, but this is very sweet and grain forward for how smooth it is. No hint of youthful ehtanol or brashness. Just so interesting, and reasonably priced I think for what it is. I'm impressed with this distillery

I'm in the Denver area and I keep hoping they'll open tours up again soon. As I understand it they shut them down for covid and just never re-opened them.

I *really* want to try that three chamber rye...but this 4 year and their 5 year BiB are also high on that list.
If you can‚Äôt find it hit me up. I‚Äôll fill a sample bottle for you.
Wow, thank you! Thankfully all 3 are pretty readily available around me. Appreciate it though!"

* They're told they're family while working for HH, but feel they're not being treated like it. One worker of over 15 years died of covid while working, was given a one-minute moment of silence on each shift that day, never to be mentioned again. Workers there for 40, 45, even 55 years are granted nothing for their tenure. 

* Worker pay is significantly lower than all of the other similar distilleries. The non-traditional overtime revamp that they're pushing on the workers results in less overtime pay than the previous one.

* Heaven Hill had several days before the contract expired to reach out with a better proposal and did not. The workers' insurance has been cut off and HH has hired security guards for the grounds and bodyguards.

The story behind this stuff, from K&L:

> This unbelievable product is the result of one man's conviction. Todd Leopold has been on a mission to re-create the flavors of the rye whiskies of old. There are many questions about why rye whiskey doesn't seem to taste quite like it once did, and as it turns out, almost all the country's rye was once produced on stills like the one Todd had commissioned by Vendome Copper Works in Louisville.

> After years of research and planning, they've finally arrived at the final product, the closest approximation to what would have been the most popular spirit in pre-Prohibition America, the Three Chamber distilled rye. This is similar to what distillers across the northeast would have used to make whiskey at their farms in Pennsylvania, Maryland and beyond.

A hefty pricetag of $250 that reflects the time and money spent on developing this Rye and it's custom still.

American Whiskey review #243

*********************

**Leopold Bros ""Three Chamber Rye"" Bottled in Bond, 50%**

**Nose:** Wow it's really interesting. Farmy and grassy, pepper, bright fresh rye, copper pennies, citrus, anise, mild acetone, green apple, caramel. These are some wild notes on this nose that by should be bad, but they somehow come together well and it works. It's farmy and funky but not in a totally offensive way 

**Taste:** Caramel and green apple, pepper, big grassy rye, anise, bright and crisp, some more tinny copper and very mild ethanol. Just like the nose it has a wild and funky character that somehow never gets out of hand. It works really well. Tastes young but uses it's youth to it's advantage, feels clean and bright instead of just hot. It really lets the interesting grassy and farmy notes shine in all their uniqueness

**Finish:** Caramel and clean grassy rye, sweet grain, citrus, mild anise. Stays true to it's character til the end, never feels hot or thin

******************

I'm gonna be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this. But it's really cool stuff. There's so many gimmicky Whiskies out there but this drinks like it has a little more behind it than just a neat story. I am a BIG fan of Rye and I have never tasted anything quite like this before. It's not like a normal minty or spicy rye flavor, it's super grassy with lots of wild metallic and farmy notes. I could definitely see some people not liking it. The notes seem like it should be bad, but it somehow all comes together and works well without ever feeling offensive. I'm not gonna sit here and say that it's amazing or vastly better than more traditional Ryes out there, but it's something different that is well-executed and with an interesting concept behind it.

Thank you for reviewing this. $249 is how much it is at my local. Not for me.
George Washington Distillery rye was like this for me. Hefty pricetag, but a special product.  The thing I remember most about it was the texture.
I had a pour of this on my anniversary back in July, and then immediately went on the hunt to find a bottle. Such an interesting flavor profile. One of my favorites in the collection right now.
Leopold was way ahead of the curve when it came to small, craft spirits by about 15 years.  (Shout out to St. George on that front as well..)  I'm glad they still exist! Used to go to the original location back in Ann Arbor over a decade ago.
It‚Äôs great stuff. Worth the price of admission.
Shave $200 off that price and maybe I'd try it
 How would you say this compares to Willet 4yr Rye?
[deleted]
Guess you aren't ever trying it
Willett would be one of the more standard ryes that I mention in my review, and this leopold is too different of a profile to really compare. Persoanlly I probably prefer Willett a little over this, but the leopold is a lot of fun as a more unique experience
Willet is brighter and sweeter than this, which I found quite earthy and ‚Äòdoughy‚Äô. Definitely more viscous than the Willett, and less dill. The Leopold reminded me of Black Maple Hill‚Äôs profile in their bourbon and rye

First few sips were interesting, but overall was glad to finish it. I won‚Äôt be looking for a second pour, let alone a bottle
Sure thing, thanks for reading! I don't think the score tells the whole story here. If you want something different and unique and have money to burn it won't disappoint in that sense. But yeah realistically it was a 7 enjoyment level for me so not really a ""must have."" It's a fun 7 though"

Brandy review #60

*************

**Pouchegu ""Rare Armagnac Collection"" 1978 42 year, lot F1178-20, 50.68%**

**Nose:** Leathery & chocolatey wood, sweet toasted oak, burnt caramel, vanilla, minty chocolate, smooth balanced tannins, burnt grape, strawberry, mellow wood spice. That same incredible depth and balance I've come to love with this stuff. It's woody and dark and brooding, a touch tannic, but with such a smooth and sweet presentation

**Taste:** Big chocolatey wood, drying tannins, vanilla, sweet toasted oak and gentle spice, graham cracker, thick caramel, burnt grape, sweet cherry, grape skin. The oak is dark yet so smooth and sweet at the same time. The fruits are bold but have a brooding quality wher they never pop up in the forefront. Sweet and burnt and oaky, some dry tannic wood, and it all comes together in such a smooth and balanced way. The lower abv makes this much more light and drinkable than the younger ones, almost too light but the flavor holds out well.

**Finish:** Minty spice and black cherry, chocolatey oak, burnt caramel. Dry tannic wood builds and puckers the mouth a little, woody but sweet and chocolatey. A nice thick chocolatey and syrupy sweet finish, killer stuff

**************

How does this stuff manage to be so woody but without the wood taking over? There's so much sweeter toasted barrel notes and thick caramel to go along with all the more tannic qualities, and that dark brooding fruitiness. Man this stuff is seriously good. Not a simple case of ""more age = more wood."" There is more tannic wood but also tons of complexity and excellent Pouchegu character coming through. The lower abv gives this a lighter mouthfeel that keeps it from reaching truly epic levels I think but there's enough excellent flavor to keep the score high

Brandy review #59

********************

**Pouchegu ""Rare Armagnac Collection"" 1981, lot LD681-20, 53.7%**

**Nose:** Dark decadent caramel, wood spice, burnt grape, black cherry, the fruits are sweet yet dark and brooding, minty chocolate, deep toasted wood, sandalwood, anise spice. This is the Pouchegu I know and love, tons of depth and thickly balanced

**Taste:** Big toasted oak and building spice, Sweet dark grape and cherry, vanilla, thick chewy caramel, dark warming spice, soy sauce, charred and tannic oak, minty spice. After the more brooding nose it bursts alive on the palate. It has a sweetness and brightness while still holding onto it's darker tannic wood notes and thickly balanced character. An amazing flavor and mouthfeel

**Finish:** Brighter black cherry, sweet grape, caramel, dark toasted wood, mild tannins, hot spice, balanced rancio. Lingers sweet and mildly tannic with a faint spice tingle. The finish oozes along with that same thick & balanced depth

***********

This is much more in line with what I'm used to from the K&L Pouchegus that I've had. Simply fantastic Armagnac. So thick and it has an incredible depth and balance. Lots of dark wood and tannic notes with darkly sweet fruits and warm delicious spice. It's similar in character to the K&L 1980/1981 bottlings but it has a little more ""action"" going on, some brighter sweetness and livelier spice. I really love it.

Brandy review #58

******************

**Pouchegu ""Rare Armagnac Collection"" 1985, lot H885-20, 57.65%**

**Nose:** Toffee, deep toasted oak, minty spice, burnt vanilla, graham cracker, nilla wafer, dark toasted wood, black cherry, tart grape, hot nose-tingling spice. This is a fantastic nose. It almost noses like an oaky Bourbon except just a bit too much grape sweetness emerges to be mistaken

**Taste:** Syrupy sweet cherry and caramel, big blast of hot spice. It's easily the hottest Pouchegu I've had so far. Cherry, toasted wood, vanilla, mildly tannic. There's some good stuff here but it's just too hot. Water tames the heat and levels it out without making it too thin or boring. Thick syrupy cherry, woody caramel, mildly tannic, still a nice warm spice burn but it's leveled out.

**Finish:** Cherry and hot zingy spice, syrupy caramel, anise, sweet toasted wood. Hot and sweet finish. Water draws out the finish, more syrupy-sweet with tamed spice.

*****************

It's good, but it's the first one that needed water. It's too hot. It's usually a bad sign when I add water, it means I'm not totally enjoying it and I'm trying to improve it. It usually doesn't work, but luckily it did here. Brings down the heat without thinning it out too much. Still not as good as other Pouchegus I've been trying. The nose is by far the best part. With all the spice heat I almost enjoy it more thinking of it as a Bourbon-y Armagnac like the L'Encantada Lous Pibous, although I think those do it a little better than this. 

TL;DR Too hot, water helps a lot but doesn't bring it up to the level of other Pouchegu

So there are frequent comparisons. There is no age given on this label but it's a newer bottling so it might be about 33-34 years old.

Brandy review #57

****************

**Pouchegu ""Rare Armagnac Collection"" 1987, barrel H1, 54.2%**

**Nose:** Rasberry, grape, cherry cola, dark chocolatey mint, sweet caramel, toasted wood, vanilla, wood spice, dark tannic oak, sweet balsamic, burnt toffee. Has the balanced depth of the older vintages but just a bit more syrupy fruits, less tannic and more caramel 

**Taste:** Explosion of syrupy cherry, grape and spice. Toasted wood, thick dark grape, caramel, leather, balanced tannins, burnt sweetness, lively spice. Syrupy and thick with a nice spice blast. Has that woody depth found in the older bottles but there's a lot more lively spice action and syrupy-sweet fruits. It's bold and lively but still has that dark Pouchegu character so I hesitate to call it bright, but almost

**Finish:** Thick syrupy finish of sweet cherry, grape, big warming spice that builds, vanilla, toasted wood, caramel, mint, soft tannic notes. It's a big warm and mouth-filling finish, delicious and satisfying

**********

Not quite like the 1980/1981 K&L bottles that I'm used to. Has the same thickness and depth but where that stuff stays extraordinarily balanced and even-keeled this one has some ""pop"" to it. The fruits are brighter and sweeter, the spice is bigger. Less dank tannic oak and more sweet caramel type oak. Beautiful more lively version of Pouchegu. Drinking side by side I think I prefer my 1981 39 year K&L bottle but this is an awesome armagnac

Great review my friend. Very well described
I think this cask is now available at KL! Really appreciate the review
Yep, the hontambere at K&L is the same cask as this one. It's a bit pricey
Was this available from another bottler as well? Price does seem high but wonder if it's the way of the future :'(
Hontambere is not the usual bottler that K&L uses for Pouchegu. They usually use Rare Armagnac Collection. I know K&L put RAC on their site but it's not the same one. Iys a different bottle. We have to wait and see if their usual Rare Armagnac Collection pouchegu has gone up this much, I'm hoping not"

****************

**Hughes Belle of Bedford Rye (MGP) 8 year single barrel, Jack Rose pick, 57.2%**

**Nose:** Toffee, brown sugar, cool mint, dark toasted oak, light cherry, vanilla, minty barrel char, nose-tingling dark funky rye spice. Nice rich oak with lots of cool minty Rye character coming through I love it 

**Taste:** Chocolatey mint, pine, caramel, darkly sweet toasted wood, brown sugar, vanilla, sharp clean Rye, some lively rye spice adds a little action but never feels too hot. Really nice oak on here that feels toasted and sweet but not heavy at all. Overall it keeps a very clean profile with lots of sharp Rye flavor coming through

**Finish:** Lots of mint and clean Rye, brown sugar, light sweet cherry, toasted wood. A really nice minty sweet Rye finish. Lingering Rye spice and sweet sugary oak

*****************

This is more like it! A much better barrel than the disappointing Potomac pick I had before this. Still wouldn't say it's super oaky but there's enough to feel the age, with tons of big clean Rye flavor coming through. It has a sweet and minty profile with just enough darker oak notes and vanilla to level it all out. Very sippable and delicious. This is my kind of MGP Rye

Love that bottle design.

I‚Äôve never had the good fortune of trying a Jack Rose pick, but my impression is that they basically never miss.
Nice reviews for these 2. This basically mirrors my experience with MGP single barrels. Some are fantastic, but a decent percentage (maybe 50%) are just meh and not worth the chase or msrp. So I've learned to not chase a particular brand just because they source from MGP, but focus on stores/groups that actually can identify special barrels. Just seems some want to have a single barrel to sell and upcharge even if it's really only batch worthy.
Jack Rose Dining Saloon just might be the most wonderful place on Earth.
This was my first Jack Rose but yeah I think I've heard good things about them. But I also hear they are super expensive
You are safe with a Jack Rose pick.  Their Wilderness Trail and RR Single Barrel picks are shockingly good.

Even attached to Jack Rose, $100+ seems an INSANE price to pay for MGP juice with a fancy label.
I've found this too, although my experience might be a little higher than 50% good barrels. I'm a huge fan of MGP rye though so I end up taking the risk sometimes especially with these older 8+ year barrel that have been popping up. I actually did not take the risk on these, I just got the chance to try them from a friend"

American Whiskey review #241

***************

**Hughes Belle of Bedford Rye (MGP) 8 year single barrel Potomac pick, 57.4%**

**Nose:** Brown sugar, mint, caramel, graham cracker, toasted wood, herbal rye, hot spice tingle. Beautiful clean Rye character and sweet toasted wood all very well-balanced

**Taste:** Big brash spice and mint, cinnamon, green apple, sweet brown sugar and toasted wood, some light wood funk. It's hot and brash compared to the balanced nose, with nice strong Rye character. The flavor comes at you in too much of a flash of heat unfortunately. 

**Finish:** The hot spice and cinnamon keeps going fiery and hot, settles into herbal rye, sweet brown sugar, faint fruity green apple.

***************

This is a good Rye but not quite up to the quality I was hoping for with an MGP Rye at 8 years of age. This is more in line with some of the better 5-7 year MGP Rye I've had like Senator or Barrell single barrel. The nose promises great things but then it's a flash of hot spice that sweeps away the flavor. Where is all the oak? It's still a nice fierce Rye and a few years ago when MGP was harder to come by I'd say it was great stuff. But today it doesn't quite measure up to the Nashville Barrel Company 8 year barrels.

**************

**L'Encantada Domaine Lassalle #16, 1990 30 year, 48.1%**

**Nose:** Soft nose for the ABV, deep toasted oak, coffee, graham cracker, pastry, rich swert caramel, understated warm fruity grape, warm floral notes, gentle minty spice. A delicious nose and very unique, like some kind of armagnac flavored bakery-fresh cinnamon bun

**Taste:** Big toasted wood, tannic bitterness with just a hint of bite to it, sweet caramel, sharp coffee and creamy mocha, grape, sweet cherry, no real spice heat to speak of. It's smooth on the palate but with a nice mouthfeel. Very complex and unique character that stays well-balanced and goes down easy

**Finish:** Tannic wood, sweet toasted oak, vanilla, black cherry, graham cracker and pastry, lots of creamy mocha. It's quality carries through well into the finish with the complexity and delicious coffee pastry notes. 

**********

I've never had an Armagnac quite like this. I really enjoy it. There's lots of interesting notes like the coffee and warm balanced floral quality along with the more traditional punchy oak and fruits. It all balnces together really well. It's maybe a bit soft in the mouthfeel but everything is well-executed so I can't really complain.  If it had just a little more oomph it would be a real stunner of a cask I think. Still a total winner for it's quality and uniqueness, just like the one I reviewed right before this. After trying my first two Lassalles in a row I'm a fan, and want to try more

**Taste:** Sweet toasted wood and mint, caramel, sweet grape, graham cracker and pastry type wholesomeness, sweet floral lavender, orange caramel, easygoing tannins, tart black cherry. It's super complex and the mouthfeel is just right. Has a hint of punchy Aramagnac boldness but feels effortlessly thick and smooth overall. The complexity of classic punchy caramel oak & fruit along with the smooth floral notes is very well executed and balanced

**Finish:** Rancio and sweet black cherry, thick caramel, more of that smooth lavender. It keeps it's complex yet thick smooth character through the finish, lingering warm fruits and lavender with mildly bitter oak

**************

I think this is my first Lassalle and I love it. Going in my main question was how this would compare to Pibous, which was made at the same domaine around the same time as this. And it's quite different. Different enough to have it's own charm and qualities and doesn't warrant a ""better/worse"" comparison. Pibous tends to be much more punchy, more oak and spice and dramatic flavor. This is beautiful in it's complexity and still no softy itself. A great Armagnac

Scotch review #259

*********************

**Ballechin 2009 11 year r/Scotch ""The Ultimate"" first fill sherry, 58.3%**

**Nose:** Thick peat, toffee, sulfury red wine, black cherry, orange citrus, creamy vanilla, toasted wood, chocolate, sweet char. Toasted and peaty, sherry is sweet and just a touch brash and sulfury

**Taste:** Creamy caramel, thick peat, toasted wood, sweet fruity cherry, strawberry, tart berry, light sulfury wine, spice, vanilla. The wine and spice hit a little brash, really explodes on the palate with a combination of heat and sweetness that has a nice backbone of toasted woody peat. The peat and creamy barrel notes are really nice with the sweet wine 

**Finish:** Spice and brash wine sweetness, toasted wood, bright citrus and red berry fruits, mellow peat, delicious sweet barrel char

***************

Delicious peat+sherried Scotch. The sherry is very well-integrated which has been a common trait of the wine-aged Ballechin in this series. Peat is huge but at the same time it has a thick and mellow feel that integrates other flavors well, there's creamy and toasted barrel notes and wine sweetness that all meld together well. It's maybe not quite as balanced as the two SFTC bottlings. This one is more lively, more spice and the sherry is a little more sweet and upfront(comparitively speaking) which works great in it's own way. I personally prefer the SFTC bottlings, but this is a great Scotch and also the better value as those are a similar price for a 500ml bottle. Availabe on Finedrams.com for about $90

My main takeaway from this series is that you can't seem to go wrong with Ballechin. They are doing great things with peated Scotch and I think it especially takes very well to wine influence.

**Nose:** Thick peat, bbq meat, black licorice, barrel char, toasted wood, vanilla, spice, strawberry, dark grape, chocolate covered cherry, toffee. Thick peaty and dark with really nice charred anise. A very mellow fruity wine influence

**Taste:** Toffee, thick meaty peat, toasted wood, sweet vanilla, anise, dark earthy strawberry, mellow berry fruits, light sulfury red wine, chocolate, black licorice. Wine influence is mellow, it's a thick warm kind of chocolatey strawberry and dark berry fruitiness. Lots of peat, dark wood and delicious barrel char to balance it out. The anise/black licorice char is light and adds to the complexity. Great mouthfeel and the flavor all melds wonderfully

**Finish:** Light anise and barrel char, sweet vanilla, thick creamy peat, some faint sulfury wine sweetness. Anise and sweet charred peat lingers. A very simple yet delicious finish actually. 

**************

Like the Bordeaux cask I had before this it's not quite what I was expecting. It's such a mellow and well-balnced wine influence, not intrusive or overly sweet at all. It feels chocolatey and peaty with a rich mellow fruitiness. It's excellent, has a lot of personality and tons of balance(just like the Bordeaux cask before this). It isn't just ""PEAT+WINE=SWEET WINEY PEAT"" like this style can be sometimes. Very impressed by this distillery and this line of SFTC bottlings.

Thanks for this review. Your descriptive words are mouth-watering:) I gather from your review of the Bordeaux cask that you may prefer this to the former? I was lucky to grab this and looking forward to cracking it.
Hard to not read this as ‚Äúball chin‚Äù tbh
Man, this sounds good! Thanks for the review!
I just finished the Sherry Oloroso cask. Great review! I live these Edradour offerings.
This sounds lovely, nice reviews. I really enjoy how surprising Edradour/Ballechin can be
I love burgundy and scotch so this sounds good. 
Is it a pricey one?
I've got this one. I love it.
Awesome review.

My favorite part is where you talk about how amazingly awesome it is and I can't buy it! /s

Sounds lovely and I hope they have another expression aging in Burgundy right now.
Oh nice! They are both excellent and I even scored them both the same, but yes I slightly prefer the Burgundy. First thing I did was check FineDrams and was immediately sad that it was gone. So lucky you!
I think you pronounce the E, so I always think of it as ""balls on chin""
Not too bad, They are about $80 for 500ml bottle on Finedrams
All credit to @Bradbo ""McSplits"" Baggins as he helped me in making the decision to grab this. Glad I took his insightful recommendation and your review validates that decision:)
Haha, he goes by u/bradbobaggins here and yes he is definitely a Ballechin enabler

Scotch review #257

**********

**Ballechin 2005 12 year ""Straight From the Cask"" Bordeaux cask #398, 55.7%**

**Nose:** Heavy peat, bbq meat, vanilla, sulfury wine, hot peppery spice, tart berry, bubbly wine sweetness, peaty iodine notes, burnt caramel, sweet char. It almost has the meaty peaty quality of an Octomore, and the heavy sweet wine influence you often find in Octomore as well

**Taste:** The mouthfeel is way more soft and balanced than I was expecting from the powerful nose. Soft strawberry wine, caramel, big meaty peat, vanilla, toasted wood, chocolate, sulfury wine, syrupy berry sweetness, menthol spice. The peat is thick but tamed and there's a lot of wine sweetness, it all softly melds together with some nice wood notes. I often find that strong sweet wine influences can overpower even a heavily peated Scotch but this stays very well-balanced and drinkable

**Finish:** Sweet strawberry and berries, soft sulfury wine, thick peat, toffee, chocolatey wood, mellow spice. Peaty and chocolatey with a soft and balanced fruity sweetness, vanilla barrel char on the end. Tasty finish.

****************

Not quite what I was expecting. These wine finished Scotches can often get a strong sickly-sweet and overpowering wine thing going on (looking at you Port Charlotte). But this has a soft and well-balanced feel. There's a bit of spice and sulfur that keeps it interesting but nothing jumps out and smacks you in the face too hard. A delicious peat monster with a very well done wine influence that never feels overpowering or intrusive

First I have to ask, where are you that you can get such a wonderful wide variety of Scotches? Your reviews are fabulous. I'd love to be able to taste such rare scotches. My first bottle of Ballechin 10yr OB is on its way from fine drams ordered last week. I'm sure it has no exotic finish but at least I'll get to know the spirit.

Second as much as I love your reviews and am jealous of your scotch experiences I wonder about your rating scale. In the English language Great is better than Excellent Everytime..... Everytime, except...... think about it.
Thanks, I'm glad you enjoy my reviews! I'm in the U.S., nowhere specal really. I just happen to be lucky enough to be in a group that shares a lot of good stuff with each other, so I get to sample a wide variety of stuff I would otherwise not be be able to.

I haven't had the standard 10 year but I've been impressed with all the Ballechin I've tried so I bet it will be good. They seem to do everything right

I borrowed the rating scale from t8ke. Honestly I do my best but often have a little trouble grading. I'm not sure I know what you mean by your last sentence, when is excellent better than great?
In the rating scale #7 is Great and #8 is Excellent. Am I the first person to point it out? The GOAT now is the MEOAT(most excellent of all time?) I love the reviews but Great then excellent has always made me wonder.... just saying.
Great is better than Good, Excellent is another level above that. Think of how often you say Great instead of Excellent. Usually something that is Excellent makes you stop and think about it before you make your exclamation. Anyway that's how I look at it. Also, greatest is different than great.
Do not even pass that Kool aid to me. Great is better than excellent always. He's Alexander the ""Great"" not Alexander the ""Most Excellent""...... the rating scale is just a bit wrong, his reviews are...... Great.
The common consensus is that excellent is closer to perfection than great when used to describe the quality of something. 
The example of Alexander might not be a good one as in greek he is called Megas Alexander. IIrc Megas is used to describe the size or might/power of something and not the quality.
That's because he was only great. If he had done better he would be most excellent and have traveled through time in a phone booth. But he did not. He was basically Alexander the Better-than-Good."
"Review #580: Caol Ila 2001 18 year G&M ""Connoisseur's Choice"" 1st fill Bourbon barrel, 57.1%",,https://i.redd.it/3nw80s3hr6m71.jpg,"Scotch review #256

*****************

**Caol Ila 2001 18 year, G&M Connoisseur's Choice, first fill Bourbon, 57.1%**

**Nose:** Intensely thick and smooth Islay nose. HUGE beautiful Islay peat, sharp cutting iodine, thick caramel, lemon, berry, chocolatey toasted oak, black licorice barrel char, peppery spice, vanilla. A proper Islay peat monter that jumps out of the glass at you but somehow stays so thickly balanced and cohesive at the same time

**Taste:** Caramel, huge lumbering boggy peat, brine, wood spice, sharp iodine, black licorice, gritty toasted and charred oak, chocolate, sweet vanilla, some berry fruits. Amazingly balanced for how amazingly huge and thick and complex it is. Age hasn't softened the peat at all. It's just integrated everything together beautifully, so much smooth chocolatey oak and vanilla notes that complements the peat perfectly. I'm in peat heaven 

**Finish:** Sweet barrel char and black licorice, big vanilla, tons of peat. No surprises here, just a huge sweet and charred peaty finish. The sweet vanilla and chocolatey peat lingers for ages

*****************

This is Caol Ila, and indeed Islay, at about it's best. Straightforward Bourbon-barrel peat-monster perfection. No sherry or weird wine finishes to jumble everything up. And it's everything I could hope for in an older Islay, the peat hasn't been dulled or tamed one bit it's just been drenched with tons of chocolatey and charred toasted oak notes. Extremely well aged, all the big notes you can get from Islay peat and 18 years of 1st fill Bourbon have integrated perfectly. This is a beautiful Scotch. An easy high score on this one

I absolutely loved reading your review. The IBs of Caol Ila that I‚Äôve been fortunate to have purchased were truly amazing. The distillate from that distillery is sublimely complex and versatile, and the IBs generally showcase the quality.
That sounds phenomenal. I recently got a bottle of the Gordon and Macphail Discovery Caol Ila 13 and have been really enjoying it.
I got to taste this straight out of the barrel when I went to the distillery. It was fantastic. If you don't mind me asking, where did you get it, and how much was it?
I like this bottle as well. It tasted like fruity beef jerky.
Another great review, this sounds just amazing. Bourbon cask aged scotch is IMHO, the best way to showcase a distilitant (sp?). Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I really enjoy a good Sherry or wine cask finished or aged scotch but a bourbon cask aged is, to me, whisky aged as it should be. Cheers dude!
I have a bottle of this I‚Äôve yet to open. Looking forward to when I decide to try it!! Great review, thank you!
This reminds me I have a Connoisseur‚Äôs Choice HP30 that I still need to crack open! Hope it‚Äôs as good as this bottling.
Well thank you! Caol Ila isn't as sexy as the other Islay distilleries and doesn't get the same kind of attention, but they are a real peat workhorse. It's such a straightforward and excellent peat monster
Right on, that sounds awesome. I tried this from a friends bottle, he got it at K&L in california for about $160 I believe
I agree, especially with peat. Sherry and wine is fun and all but imo peat is best in a bourbon barrel. 

It's funny I dont think of caol ila as a ""favorite distillery,"" but when it's a good barrel I am head over heels. It's up there with all the other islay greats even if it tends to not be as sexy or sought after as other islay distilleries
Sure thing, thanks for reading! You have this same bottling? Barrel #308899? If so I'm jealous haha
How the heck do you forget about a bottle like that? I've only had one other connoisseurs choice I can think of, a glen Scotia 26 year that was delicious. So I've liked the brand so far
Biggest output on the island, IIRC, and it‚Äôs been feeding the IBs like crazy the last few years. Yet if you trust some of the most prolific and regarded bloggers etc., CI is batting an astoundingly high percentage in those IBs. Seems to be essentially can‚Äôt miss.
https://www.klwines.com/p/i?i=1538145

More like $190. I haven't opened mine yet. I am waiting for my father to visit but with the travel restrictions from EU it doesn't look like it'll happen soon...
Hmm, actually I see that I have a slightly different one: 
Gordon & MacPhail, Caol Ila 18yo, 57.2%
Cask No. 308901. Filled 2001, bottled 03.02.2020

Here‚Äôs hoping it‚Äôs similar enough to yours when I open it!!
I know, right?! It‚Äôs less that I forgot about it and more that I put it away to save for a special occasion ~6 months ago and haven‚Äôt found the right time yet. I‚Äôm thinking at this point I might just bite the bullet and open it.
Yes you are correct, it produces more Scotch than any distillery on Islay. That's because it is owned by Diageo, so most of it goes into blends especially Johnny Walker. But yes a lot still ends up in IB's as well
Wow, very similar specs, similar barrel number, and bottled within a month of each other. Interesting. Hope yours is as good as this one!
Opening it can be the special occasion
I truly hope it is!
I like the way you think, good sir!"

It's said to be first fill Oloroso but as usual doesn't say it anywhere on the tube. Haven't seen it for sale yet so I don't know the exact price, but the last release was a bit over $100 so I imagine it's close to that.

Scotch review #255

**********

**Kilkerran 8 Cask Strength 2021 edition, first fill Oloroso, 56.9%**

**Nose:** Oh lovely. Thick creamy toffee and malt, chocolate fudge, smooth toasted oak, vanilla, sweet sugary strawberry and cherry, orange creamsicle, mellow wood spice, that signature campbeltown funk. The creamy wood and malt notes with the sweet yet fruits is divine

**Taste:** Fruits are more on the forefront here. Sugary strawberry, syrupy cherry, sweet vanilla, sweet and mildly tart, bright winey funk, creamy toffee, thick Scotchy malt with chocolatey campbeltown funk , toasted wood, barrel char, vanilla. The fruits are sweet and happy but is still holds onto a lot of richer toffee wood and malty Scotch notes, with that delicious Campbeltown funk

**Finish:** Sweet creamy caramel with sweet strawberry and black cherry fruitiness, some earthy funk, wood spice, vanilla. The finish is sweet and pleasant with just enough wood and malty funk to keep it feeling like a kilkerran

**************

I poured this side-by-side with a little bit of the much-hyped 2019 recharred oloroso bottle and man they are both really good. The 2019 is more dark and sludgy with jammy fruits, darker wood notes, and more spice. This 2021 is more creamy,  fruity in a more sweet and happy way, but still has plenty of rich malty Kilkerran character to it. Insanely cohesive despite all the complexity going on. 2019 is also slightly darker in color which aligns with the flavor profiles I think. 

It's hard to pick a favorite of the two. I think 2019 recharred oloroso is the better sherry bomb, but this 2021 is a better all-around showcase of Kilkerrans core malt being complimented by a sweet sherry fruitiness. A great distillery however you look at it

I like this one more than the ultra hyped 2019. Both are excellent but this one is more fruity and funky
Just picked up a bottle of this whisky, after reading your review I cannot wait to get into it.
Great review! I‚Äôve read peopling mentioning this had too much sulfur, but seems like you didn‚Äôt have that problem. I often feel like this one suffers a bit from the 2019 hype, but nice to see it holds up so well!
As always, great review, this sounds really good. I wish Binny's would get some of these...
Nice review, pretty consistent regarding this. I want to try it, but I haven't seen it anywhere. Was this a special order? Or can be got at certain retailers or online?
Haven't had the 2019 but I have had this one and concur.  Good stuff, well crafted, smart (or lucky) choices in vatting.
They're both great but I think I agree with you. This one is more interesting and more classic Kilkerran which I love. But 2019 is more of a super dark-colored jammy sherry bomb which seems to get the people going
opposite,  2019 imo  less harsh  and feels more mature,more adult , doesnt have that huge yeast punch.  both are just stunnin but my choice is 2019 batch
I definitely detect a good bit of sulphur on this and the 2019, but I enjoy that in this style of sherried whisky.
Kilkerran has become a bit hyped, so it might come and not last long
It was a pretty hyped and sought after bottle, it's probably long gone everywhere. It sold quick
Yea, thought the same thing - here and gone."

**************

**""Jack Daniel's Single Barrel"" Barrel Proof Bourbon, Bourbon Scotch Beer NJ pick, 65.55%**

**Nose:** Big bold sweetness, maple, toffee, creamy banana funk, clean toasted wood, sweet char, big cherry and apple fruitiness, cove, herbal spice, cherry wood, vanilla. Bold and huge yet all the notes come through super clean. Amazing nose

**Taste:** Huge sweet cherry cough syrup, big brash wood and spice, toffee, maple, sweet toasted oak, building clove and wood spice, vanilla. Syrupy sweet, big clean oak, lots of clove and spice but never feels overly hot. It just pops with bold and action-packed flavor. Feels so right

**Finish:** The blast of clove and big sweet spice carries into the finish, settles into sweet Bourbon notes of hot cherry, brash oak, vanilla, lingering maple and clove

*****************

I already knew I liked these Jack Daniels BP Single Barrels, but I somehow always forget just how good they are until I try one again.

I haven't had a bad JDSBBP yet. They are definitely a great buy if you want readily available 125-135 proof.

Reviews #576/577: Pellehaut 1987 33 year -vs- 1989 31 year,,https://i.redd.it/b8exqlrp1ml71.jpg,"A side by side comparison of two similar vintages of Pellehaut Armagnac.

****************************

**Pellehaut 1987 33 year, 48.6%**

**Nose:** Caramel, sweet burnt grape, cherry, tingly wood spice, dark chocolate, dark toasted oak, barrel char, vanilla, mild balsamic

**Taste:** Syrupy sweet caramel and cherry, dark smoothly toasted oak, wood spice, sweet balsamic, mildly tannic, chocolate, vanilla

**Finish:** wood spice, tannic notes, sweet burnt grape, mild rancio, sweet caramel wood and vanilla

****************************

**Pellehaut 1989 31 year, 48.6%**

**Nose:** Caramel, dark toasted oak, burnt grape, brash spice, black cherry, vanilla. Good aged oak notes, a bit hot

**Taste:** Dark bitter wood, toasted oak, spice heat, burnt grape and cherry, the fruit is sweet and smooth, caramel, vanilla

**Finish:** Hot wood spice, settles into sweet caramel, mild rancio that trails off, black cherry, lingering dark woody sweetness

***************

Right off the bat, these are very similar to each other. At first nosing they were almost identical, but nuanced differences slowly emerged. They both feel darkly toasted, sweet and well-aged. After some air the spice heat calms down and they get super drinkable. I think the 1987 flows a little better, there's sweeter fruits and richer oak, and more complexity with the rancio notes. Slightly more balanced overall. The 1989 still has all that, but it comes across thinner and hotter. Like I said these are slight differences, I'm nitpicking for comparison's sake. For the most part it's a very consistent profile which has also been my experience with another thirty-something Pellehaut I tried. Great Armagnac for a great value

It would honestly be really interesting to see a sort of vertical tasting of some of these Pellehaut vintages where we‚Äôve gotten multiple releases from what appear to be same parcel of casks. I tried the 1989 when it was a bit younger and still found it to be a little too hot and tannic for my taste.
Something that I've come to appreciate with the 1989 (mine is younger than yours) is how sessionable it is. Sometimes with armagnac, especially the old stuff, it feels very ""heavy"" and I only want only one glass for the night. But the Pellehaut, because it's on the thinner side, doesn't have that issue.

This seems like it's got a bit more fruit and is more harmonious but I do enjoy the myriad of spices from the 1989.
I've had another similar vintage before, a 1988 I believe which is right between these. It was almost identical in profile and abv to my 1989. They seem to be very consistent at least from this era
It also feels like a service to the community to remove some of the FOMO. Missed out on what got bottled this year? Just wait until they do another batch that is likely to be very, very similar."

Brandy review #52

***********

**Villa Zarri 21 year Brandy, 45%**

**Nose:** Grape, toffee, delicious nutty toasted wood, roasted pecan, graham cracker, smooth chocolate, light mustiness, some mild bitter oak. Beautiful nutty and toffee oak on here that stays soft and perfectly well-balanced, excellent nose

**Taste:** Smooth drying antique wood, nutty toffee, mild sweet tobacco, muted and dry grape that carries throughout, light tart berry, vanilla, delicate complex wood spice. It's a classic smooth and insanely well-balanced Cognac feel, but like the nose there's some richer oak notes that are just beautiful. Smooth yet luxurious mouthfeel. You can feel the age on it without oak smacking you in the face

**Finish:** Light grape and berry, milk chocolate, nutty caramel, the smooth ligtly nutty and chocolatey oak rides out with light fruits and then some rancio notes creep in and pucker the mouth on the tail end. The light rancio and sweet caramel wood lingers

************

My limited experience with Cognac has been too varied to know if this has any kind of uniquely Italian feel. It basically drinks like an excellent Cognac. Fruit is delicate and not super sweet. Drying antique wood. Plenty of oak but it's a beautifully balanced and complex wood feel, lets you really feel the age without getting smacked in the face by it. Individually all the complex notes in this are delicate, but together it all equals this rich and luxurious mouthfeel of Cognac flavor.

Thanks for the review! I have a bottle of the 1991 24 yo cask strength from k&l wines waiting to be opened. After reading your review I am looking forward to trying it!
Villa Zarri stuff is great. Believe they did a tobacco infused 23 year as well? It was quite the experience
Thanks for the review!
I can get a half liter bottle of their 19 year old at cask strength for 60‚Ç¨, do you think it's worth taking over something like delamain pale & dry?
I have that single barrel from K&L, haven't opened mine yet either. I'm really looking forward to it after this one
No question a 19 year cask strength Villa Zarri is the better option of those, definitely worth picking up at that price"

**Nose:** Sweet and creamy, butterscotch, caramel, candy cherry, creamy vanilla frosting, sweet toasted oak, bright clean rye, balanced dill and herbal rye spice. What a delicious nose, Scotch levels of creamy sweetness intermingled with delicious Rye

**Taste:** Butterscotch, sugary frosting, bright clean rye, herbal notes and dill, cherry, caramel, vanilla, sweet toasted wood. Between the two barrels it seems to have absorbed tons of creamy barrel notes and sweet vanilla. Melds together extremely well with the clean, fruity Rye flavor. Just wow. 

**Finsih:** Bold Rye flavor emerges on the finish with big herbal rye grain, warm spice, dill, toasted wood, sweet vanilla, cherry, caramel. After all the sweetness I love how big and bold of a rye finish it is. A very fitting end to a delicious Whiskey

Wow this is fantastic. The wine finishes that these usually get are fun and all, but realistically this is one of the best High Wests I've ever had. I don't know what I was expecting from a Bourbon barrel finish but it seems to have gotten a double dose of sweet and creamy toasted barrel notes. But the rye flavor still emerges bright and clean.

Damn this review was awesome, jealous I‚Äôll never get to try this one lol
Great review! I was surprised when I tried a bourbon finished Rendezvous Rye. I didn‚Äôt expect it to do much but it was really fantastic and similar to your experience.
Thanks for your detailed review. I always enjoy reading them.  I definitely couldn't have done this bottle similar justice with your choice of words here. These bottles were great. Too bad I (and maybe others) may not have truly appreciated them when they were readily available and at affordable prices. These and the finished Double Ryes from those days were stellar, with the bourbon and Manhattan finishes from various stores equally so. I can only hope that recent bottlings meet this level of quality again sometime soon.
I'm thrilled that I got the chance to at least try it, but yeah it's sad that these bottlings are gone
That's awesome, yeah I had these were good but just didn't know what quite to expect. Just an older Rye basically with extra time in wood? Still not sure how it got this amazing profile from a Bourbon barrel
Thank you for the kind words, I'm glad you find my reviews enjoyable! You might do better than you think if you give it a try. And yeah, it's easy to take things for granted but at least we got to enjoy them back when they were around"

**John J. Bowman Single Barrel, 50%**

**Taste:** Blast of big sweet corn and spice, nutty caramel, sweet toasted oak, maple, light vanilla. It's bright and sweet with lots of lively spice, but it stays under control and never feels too hot. It's grain forward and a little brash in a fun way but still has some nice balanced oak to it. Very sippable

**Finish:** Peppery spice, caramel, toasted oak, sweet corn, lingering corn and spice. A simple but tasty finish

************

A tasty little Bourbon. Bright and sweet with some nice spice action that stays under control.

I got more sweet oak and fruit than all that spice, but agreed on the score.
Yeah that's about how I feel. I just try to shy away from a negative perspective such as ""not mindblowing."" It's good Bourbon, price isn't bad, that should be enough even if there are better things out there. 

Now if it's a $100+ bottle then it's worth mentioning that when it's ""not amazing""
It's been heavily reviewed recently on bourbon YouTube. I think people are catching on to it.
That's pretty much right, except it's a custom mash, rumor has always been a 1.5 ratio of 1 and 2, even when I was at the distillery they wouldn't confirm except to say it's specifically made for them. Nobody seems to know 100% but that's been the word for years. Also whatever magic occurs with the last distilling on site. 

It is different from rest of BTs 1 and 2 offerings, you know it's BT distillate but it stands out a bit from the others and not a straight mash 1 or 2 bottle. For me I prefer it over EHT SiB/SmB, RHF, Blantons Gold. Gberally more refined as well, my last 3 RHF taste like they added 20% acentone to each bottle lol.
It seems like you generally pick up on fruit more than I do and I pick up on spice more. Bourbon rarely strikes me as very fruity. I usually get more complex fruit notes from Rye, and Bourbon is usually just different shades of ""cherry"" for me. Candy cherry, black cherry, cherry cough syrup, etc
Lol why did this get downvoted? Have an upvote. Oh that reddit downvote hive mind lol. I agree, I do get fruit but it also has a sweeter oak note, I've had so many and generally consistent in that regard (not as much bitter tannin bite for oak). Comes off sweeter. I get the bright notes also that u/buckydean mentioned, though I associate brightness with fruity moreso. Like how RC6 was bright vs other makers, had a fruit note that popped with it.

Edit - lol, went from like -4 to up 2 ha
I think I started the weekend of with the first review. I agree. Its definitely good and is worth picking up.
Ah that would make sense. I don‚Äôt venture into YouTube much at all so I was in the dark about that. Weird it‚Äôs got a big uptick out of nowhere but that seems to be how bourbon works.

That's a lot of great info, thank you for the informative reply
There's one I watch occasionally that did one a few weeks ago. YouTube then auto recommended 3 others that have since done a review of it too. 

If it keeps the taters chasing all the BT, so be it. I'm a fan, but nothing is worth secondary. Just wait them out."

American Whiskey review #237

*************

**""Nashville Barrel Company"" 8 year Rye (MGP), r/Bourbon single barrel, 54.79%**

**Nose:** Right up front you are hit with huge bold rye notes. Nose-numbing evergreen and cinnamon, peppery rye spice, funky dill. Green apple. It's almost hot on the nose with all the Rye action but it's being tamed extremely well with rich toffee, toasted oak, tobacco, sweet brown sugar. Thick and epic Rye nose

**Taste:** Bold clean Rye flavor right up front again. Delicous clean rye grain, bright evergreen, mint, toffee, rye spice, sweet brown sugar, clean toasted oak, wood spice. It's more grain forward, tons of clean bold Rye flavor but there's still plenty of age and sweet oak that has balanced it out and kept it from feeling too hot or spirity the way a younger version of this profile would. It all combines to make a fierce yet balanced attack of rye flavor

**Finish:** The huge clean minty Rye just keeps coming with sweet toasted oak, brown sugar, big Rye spice, a little minty char on the tail end. Crisp sweet minty rye lingers a long time

*****************

A rye-lovers dream. As a rye fiend, and especially as an MGP rye fiend, I approve. The strong 95% rye character is on full display here, bold and clean and delicious. Enough age and sweet toasted oak to balance it out but it really lets the rye flavor shine without feeling too hot. The whole thing feels bold and thick yet very clean. I'm just loving how very RYE it feels down to the core. I drink a lot of different spirits, and MGP Rye like this is some of my favorite stuff out there It is so great having older barrels like this available again. Even if it is on the pricey side. Great job on this one t8ke, wish I had gotten the other one too

Had a feeling based on the level of the bottle in the picture this was going to be a positive review.
Still waiting on mine.  Excited to try it.
So good! I'm loving my bottle just as much.
awesome!! So glad you enjoyed - I love this one
Nice review.  My only rye is Sazerac, and after reviews of the previous NBC r/bourbon pick, I jumped in on the #197.  I'm really looking forward to receiving it and diving in.
Great review, thanks! I also snagged this bottle and I‚Äôm thoroughly impressed as well. Very very good."
"Review #571: Kilkerran 8 year Cask Strength ""recharred oloroso,"" 57.1%",,https://i.redd.it/gigdzfr341j71.jpg,"I'm not completely sure how it works, but I think Kilkerran releases one of these Cask Strength batches every(?) year now. I only know that it was advertised and spoken of as ""recharred Oloroso"" but it doesn't actually have that or a release year anywhere on the bottle or tube. And if the 8yr cask strength is an annual release, I'm not sure that it always was. Maybe someone can clear this up for me 

Scotch review #254

*********

**Kilkerran 8 year Cask Strength ""recharred oloroso,"" 57.1%**

**Nose:** Toffee, graham cracker, chocolatey and charred oak, heavy dark jammy sherry notes, strawberry jam, black cherry, mildly tart berry, chocolate cherry, bitter chocolate, caramel, lots of malty brine, toasted oak, some funk. Mix of heavy dark sherry and classic briny Kilkerran is killer

**Taste:** Toffee, campbeltown funk, burnt caramel, thick malt, brown sugar, big brine, graham cracker, eases into well integrated thick sherry notes, strawberry jam, chocolate covered cherries, woody tart berry, toasted oak, mild spice. It does a great job of capturing that thick and sludgy chocolate sherry feel but still has a lot of complexity and bolder flavors emerging. It's sweet but it's lots of darker burnt barrel sweetness in addition to the fruity sherry sweetness. 

**Finish:** Sweet malt, graham cracker, milk chocolate, brighter strawberry and sweet tart berry that pops, thick caramel, sugary sweet fruits, mellow warm spice tingle. A smooth and sweet finish, feels almost upbeat after all the darker flavors 

***************

It's a sherry bomb, but just barely. It still holds onto a lot of it's briny and funky Kilkerran character, and it makes for a delicious mix of flavors. For the complexity that it shows it all stays very cohesive, almost even smooth. Another great fucking Scotch from Kilkerran

These are the batches and only identifiable by their ABV. The 2019 is the one that started the hype about these bottles. 

Release	Bottled	ABV	Cask type

5	Feb '21	56.9%	Oloroso Sherry

4	Oct '19	57.1%	Re-charred Oloroso Sherry

3	Oct '18	56.5%	Ex-Bourbon

2	Oct '17	55.7%	Ex-Bourbon

1	Mar '17	56.2%	Ex-Bourbon

Where you able to get a bottle for a decent price? I can definitely agree with what you tasted. I will miss my bottle when it's empty and sadly I can not replace it considering the market value...
Really good review, I think you captured the kind of darker funky notes of this one really well, I doesn't drink like 57.1 at all, I am enjoying this less heavy sherry style and is something I would like to see others do more.

I hope they return to a full bourbon cask next time around I think batch 2 was my favorite.
This is 2019. No release for 2020. Great stuff
Thank for posting the batch info, agreed these flew under the radar until that 2019, adding Sherry to things tends to get a certain segment riled up. This also coincided with a steep rise (where demand was already ridiculous) for anything Springbank relate, at least in the markets where I can get bottles from.
Thank you, this is great info! I went through a bottle of the 55.7% and it was amazing too. I paid $110 for this bottle, which is close to retail but maybe just a tad high. The 55.7% was only about $70 or $80 a few years ago so these have really jumped
Thanks, I edited my review and took 2020 out. I just remember that it was big in 2020 and that's when my store got it and that's when I bought it. Kind of goes to show how difficult it is to treat these like an annual release when they don't actually give any year or info except for the abv"

American Whiskey review #236

****************

**Old Forester Birthday Bourbon 10 year, 2020 edition, 49%**

**Nose:** Brown sugar, big smooth toasted oak, vanilla, light musty tobacco, toasted marshmallow, caramel, sweet corn, candy cherry, a hint of menthol spice. A very nice nose, has an old school Bourbon feel. Sweet and pleasant and agreeable but not overly light. Very inviting

**Taste:** No surprises after the nose, it's tasty and super drinkable. Velvety smooth caramel, sweet toasted oak, lots of delicious vanilla, cherry, brown sugar, sweet corn. Maybe a hint of wood spice but really no heat to speak of. Like an old school Bourbon that's made to be sweet and smooth, but at 49% it still has great mouthfeel and flavor.

**Finish:** Carries on with sweet barrel notes of smooth toasted oak and vanilla, graham cracker, brown sugar, a very mild tannic bite. Pleasant and drinkable til the end

**************

Feels very much like an old school Bourbon, sweet and smooth and drinkable. From back in the days when things were well aged and didn't have to be a barrel proof monster. The abv is perfect to deliver that kind of profile while still having lots of depth and flavor and a great mouthfeel. Just pleasant and delicious through and through

Nice review! üëçüèº It truly sounds delicious. 
I wish I could find it near me without being $400-$600. Cheers!
Oooowee it‚Äôs about that time of year again too!
I need to revisit my bottle.  I was lucky enough to win the chance to buy at MSRP through Ohio's state liquor agency lottery.  I cracked it in early January to celebrate a good friend's birthday and we each had 1 reasonable pour and I hid the bottle after that to make sure no one else in my house touched it lol
I love this bottle and it‚Äôs fantastic but I feel like Bday Bourbon has been getting worse and worse. And I hear from the inside, this year‚Äôs release is more of that. Zykan apparently isn‚Äôt happy with it.
AI driven social media sucks. So does SH.
Chill-filtered and <100 proof? Sounds like a Brown-Forman product alright
What are the odds of getting this in alabama when it comes out this year? I really want to get some but not at secondary price
Fruity sweet and simple indeed.
They want $899 in my area
Less than a month! Or just over 6 more months if you're in Virginia...

The 2021 is going to be murder to get, even more so than usual.
Source?
Need to win a lottery spot. I scored a bottle last year along with a Lot B and I was 40th in line at the Auburn store.
Tried it last month for $45/ 1oz pour. Steep but its the only way I can try it.
I just want to have my name drawn once for anything in the VA lottery. Beginning to lose hope that real people actually win it.
Why do you think this year will be harder?
I have a family friend who works high up in the front office for B-F
Yeah that‚Äôs what I figured
I‚Äôd be game at that price for a pour.  Definitely no interest in $899 blind bottle buy
Very true. I think i‚Äôd give it a go at that price. What did you think of if?
It took me 5 years (and entering EVERY lottery) before I got picked.  Got a bottle of Old Rip Van Winkle 10 year old.
If it gives you any hope my dad has won a bottle of van winkle lot B and his friend won a WLW, lucky bastards I tell ya.
They're doing a special 21st birthday bottling, the few reviews out so far have given it very high scores.
Oh damn! That‚Äôs probably a pretty good source  :)
Agreed. I need to have some standards. üòÇ
I have trouble remembering specific flavors unless I write them down, but I remember is being very smooth, with an even burn across the whole mouth. Sweet and long lingering.
I made the mistake of adding 3 drops of water to it about halfway through and it instantly killed the flavor though.

I also tried rip van winkle 10 year a few days later and prefer the rip to the old forester for sure. Both were very very good though. The rip was the best I've had.
How hard is it to get from their retail store on the release day generally? Any idea?
I don't believe they release BB in their store. I could be wrong. If they do, I would imagine it will be like any OF special release and have a line of a hundred people camping out for it.

I love Birthday Bourbon, it's definitely in my top 3 most sought after bourbons, but unless you have friends in the industry or a pile of money sitting around, you probably won't ever own one."

Available on Seelbachs for a kinda steep price of $189

Brandy review #51

*********************

**""Through the Grapevine"" Tessendier Lot 95 Cognac, 55%**

**Nose:** Thick toffee, tobacco, toasted wood, slight rancio and mustiness, sugary vanilla, lots of sweet wood spice, bright citrus, floral cherry, creamy caramel. Lots of wonderful oaky wood influence, but doesn't overwhelm or get in the way of the sweet and mellow Cognac character. Extremely well balanced and extremely delicious 

**Taste:** Bold grape and cherry fruitiness hits big on arrival but still in that dry cognac kind of way, thick syrupy caramel, creamy, sweet toasted wood, tons of bright wood spice that stays well balanced, citrus, tobacco, sweet vanilla. A lot of complexity between the fruits, toasted sweetness and the darker oaky flavors that all balances out effortlessly. Fantastic Cognac 

**Finish:** Toasted wood, sweet vanilla, mellow fruity grape, slowly descends into darker rancio notes and light sweet grape, lingering wood spice and rancio. Long and complex finish, God it's so good

***********

On the bolder and woodier side, but it keeps it's dry mellow Cognac character in tact. Very oaky but also bright and fruity and sweet, with some nice rancio notes coming out on the finish. Beautiful stuff. Absolutely zero heat from the 55% abv, just tons of thick and vibrant flavor. I'm generally a bigger fan of Armagnac, and I'm still getting into exploring Cognacs more but this is one of the best Cognacs I've had

Great review!  I have a sample of this that I can‚Äôt wait to try.
I'm considering purchasing this as a splurge for Christmas Eve dinner.  I'm a bourbon/rye drinker but think a brandy would be fun for the dress up holiday dinner.  Thoughts?  I really like and respect your reviews both here and on r/bourbon
It's fantastic! And if you live somewhere with limited access to good brandy you couldnt ask for better. It was selected by a pretty large panel including bourbon people so I feel like it's a safe bet. The only other place I know of to try some stuff if you want to go a little cheaper is finedrams, they have some good stuff. The grosperrins I've had have been fantastic you could probably take a chance on any of those. But it probably wont get to you before xmas

Thank you, I'm glad you find my reviews helpful
I'd classify the Panhandle of Florida as VERY limited as far as good brandy access goes!  The Total Wine in Gainesville is the closest thing to a significantly better selection and it's nearly 200 miles away, making $189 plus shipping much more palatable for a special occasion!  Thanks for the advice, I'll check out the grosperrins as well."

**""Jack Daniels Single Barrel"" Barrel Proof Rye, 65.95%**

**Nose:** Big toasted oak, caramel, green apple, syrupy-sweet cherry, maple, vanilla, anise, tobacco, wintergreen, chocolate mint, cool clean menthol spice. Really nice play between oak and sharp clean rye notes

**Taste:** Caramel, maple, bright syrupy cherry and mint that really pops, brash spice, menthol, wintergreen, tobacco, chocolate mint, banana, clean toasted oak. Lots of clean Rye notes with sweet brash oak. It's all very lively and bright but not overly hot at all. Tons of delicious flavor comes at you

**Finish:** Syrupy cherry and sweet toasted oak, lots of peppery wood spice, smooth rye notes. Lingering wood, mint, and cool menthol spice. Delicious finish but the rye character falls back a bit and it finishes more like a hot Bourbon.

****************

My [previous review](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/p0m04k/review_565_jack_daniels_single_barrel_barrel/) was of a different barrel of this same Rye, and for fun I drank a bit of that one side by side for comparison. They both have a very similar feel, bright and lively and brash, big on flavor but not overly hot. And both are great. This one is slightly more oaky and brash than the other barrel. I think the oak and hot spice also makes this one feel a little more Bourbony than the previous barrel, but luckily lots of clean Rye notes still come through. Objectively speaking this is every bit as delicious as the other barrel I tried, but I think I like the stronger Rye charactrer of the previous one more. But speaking as a major Rye fiend, these bottlings all seem to be winners

Well, once again you have gotten my attention. . .  8-)  I have trouble wrapping my head around the words 'jack daniels' and 'rye' together.  All of my experience is with jd bourbon.  This is 70% rye, which is kind of no-mans land (neither barely rye nor MGP land).  What does this rye taste closest to as far as other ryes?
[removed]
[removed]
And that range is why I love the funky Rye mashes, WFE 4yr etc. To me the oddball not high rye and not barely legal Ryes are delicious. Even local place in FL, Kozuba, they have a 6yr SiB Rye that's 65% (35% wheat which nobody does a mash like that), one yummy and unique profile, nothing like a barely or a high.

I can't think of anything that's similar to stuff like that, or even JDBP Rye, just like there is nothing remotley like WFE 4yr. Vs high or barely legals where you could name dozens for X bottle in each.

**Taste:** Woody caramel and big sweet cherry, an oaky and syrupy-sweet mouthfeel, menthol, dark toasted oak notes, tobacco, sweet char, vanilla. It's dark and oaky but also sweet and bright at the same time. It all comes together in an effortlessly balanced way that is super approachable and drinkable. Damn this is good

I was expecting more of an oak bomb with the age on this (which would have been fine with me), but this stuff has some serious personality. There's some dark and oaky tannic notes but they stay friendly and then there's also lots of bright fruit and sweet oak. Extremely well balanced, nothing takes over too much.

Just had a pour tonight!!  Been spacing it out.  Super balanced and complex in all the traditional old profile ways.  I especially am starting to recognize the leather aspect of this one.  Really dang good.
For those who missed out on Russell‚Äôs 13, this bottle is a VERY worthy substitute, albeit marginally easier to find‚Ä¶.
I agree with the 8, pretty darn tasty!
I blinded this against Stagg Jr batch 13, ECBP B520, and Russell's 13. I thought this had the best mouthfeel, and although Russell's edged out thanks to its flavor profile, this was right up there. Honestly one of my favorites.
One of the best not overly hyped and somewhat easy to find premium bourbons out there IMO
I saw this stuff on the shelf for $150, I know it's good but it's extremely hard for me to justify spending that much on a bottle.
How would you compare this to the #5?
This has a lot of the same characteristics I find in 12-15y KC SiBs. Tingly, syrupy sweet that is both brown sugar and fruit, rich tannins, and a long-ass finish. So much to love.
Very on point review. One of the best pours I've had this year for sure.
Glad you're liking these!
A few of you recommended I pick up a bottle. Called a dozen plus stores and found just one, gonna pick this up today and give it a shot on my birthday
Man I wish I had bought two of these.
I would put this bottle up against the highly allocated btac stuff in a blind test and be surprised if there weren't consistent picks of this bottle over many of those.
Since I got DS4 last year, I've been trying to sip it slowly and infrequently so that it would last a little longer. I really should have bought a 2nd bottle.
Thanks for the excellent review. Occasionally I‚Äôll change things up and add a drop or two of Bookers (Maw Maw batch) . Blends well. Also, plays well with a few drops of Disc #4 into Fusion #4 when I‚Äôm into a lighter bourbon experience, but still want some depth.
Yeah those leather and tobacco notes sneak in there, hiding in all the sweetness
I liked this a lot more than RR13 and glad I have several backups of it.
""marginally?""
Tbh given how this release is nearly a year old, I would say $150 is reasonable. I‚Äôd also rate this closer to a 9/10, maybe 8.5-8.75. It‚Äôs goddamn delicious
Haven't had #5, sorry
If you like more of a rounded and well-aged kentucky style, you'll like this one better for sure.  #5 has more citrus and marshmellowy sweetness going on and the oak is toned down.
Stag would blow this out of the water
Thanks! And good to see you around, long time no see dude. Sounds like it's a fun one to blend and play around with
Yeah‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think this is sitting on shelves in too many places anymore
but it did sit on shelves in a lot of places. i got my bottle just a couple of months ago, and they had 2 more next to it. saw it at a couple of other spots as well.

RR13 virtually didn't even get to touch shelves. the hype on discovery 4 never  came close to that

"Review #566: Laphroaig 16 year, 48%",,https://i.redd.it/6x2mfve589g71.jpg,"A newer bottling from Laphroaig that came out last year I believe. It's being marketed as limited edition but is still available right now. Aged for 16 years in ex-bourbon American oak.

Scotch review #253

************

**Laphroaig 16 year, 48%**

**Nose:** Lots of signature Laphroaig here. Heavy medicinal peat, crisp brine, sweet caramel and vanilla, peaty menthol, sugary pastry, white cake frosting, sweet barrel char. Plenty of heavy Frog peat but with a soft and balanced feel, and quite sweet. And so clean. Lovely nose

**Taste:** All the signature Laphroaig peat you could hope for, it arrives huge yet soft and sweet. Not in a rush to smack you in the face. Big medicinal peat, caramel, honey, creamy and buttery malt, cake icing, sweet vanilla, nilla wafer, gentle and balanced wood notes. Not overly smooth at all, it has a great mouthfeel with big peat and lots of sweet bourbon barrel notes. Big flavor that has a soft and balanced flow to it. Fantastic

**Finish:** Grittier black licorice and char, gentle spice, heavy Laphroig peat, sweet vanilla. Lingering creamy barrel sweetness and peat

****************

I'm a huge fan of Laphroaig, but I'll be the first to admit some of their bottlings miss the mark. So honestly I wasn't expecting much from this. It's fantastic though. And it's a unique expression in their lineup that accomplishes it's intended flavor profile extremely well. Classic Bourbon barrel Laphroaig but it's a softer, sweeter, and more balanced Laphroaig that doesn't water things down or sacrifice it's peaty Islay soul to get there. In fact they upped the abv to 48% and it does really well. Still a peat monster, but a soft and sweet peat monster. It's beautiful in it's simplicity. So many Laphroaig special releases just throw crazy wine barrels into the mix and I feel like they often don't work very well. But this stuff embraces the Bourbon barrel profile that really lets Laphroig shine. Maybe not vastly superior to stuff like the 10 Cask Strength which will give you more of a peat assault, but it's one of my favorite Laphroaig special releases in quite some time and a lot of fun for it's uniqueness.

I tasted the Laphroaig 16 next to Ardbeg Blaaaaack a couple months ago and preferred the Laphroaig. And I‚Äôm typically an Ardbeg guy. The Laphroaig 16 is a nicely balanced dram. I do think that it is a bit overpriced but then again you‚Äôre paying for the age statement.
One of the few options for a mid-teen Islay peated whisky.  Compared to Ardbeg's 19 this is a steal!  Echoing the pricing disparity of the annual Carideas vs CR releases.  Even IB Caol Ila around this age is hitting close to $200.  And like you I still see this around quite a few places which surprises me too.

These teen peaters don't bring the peat as aggressively as the younger OBs, but they often begin to take on more depth in the palate.  The smoke hasn't turned dark and brooding like an old Islay, but it is starting to change.

Personally I like this age range (and really old peat) and will probably be trying to find a dram of this at some point.  Thanks for the review!
I cannot find a bottle of this in my state, and it genuinely hurts me.
I got this from my sister-in-law a few years ago and was very underwhelmed. I personally prefer the cask strength, or even the standard 10 year.
Random small liquor store that I've driven by a million times had one bottle of this left on their shelf. Saw the 48% with 16y age statement and blacked out before coming to when I got home and remembered I paid $100 haha. BUT 16Y LAPHROAIG
I just finished a bottle of this last week! In terms of availability, I heard a rumor it would come around once a year in batches (though not named as such). That seems to be true based on what I've seen. It first appeared in my area towards the end of December 2019 (several months after it premiered on Amazon in the UK), then dried up, and reappeared about a month ago. Once local store even allocated the new batch with the customer loyalty program. 

Initially I was really impressed with this. It was much more intense than the green tube 15 year old, which I found quite disappointing and too mild. I got a lot of smoke, and then a lot of woody and herbal notes, but very little of the caramel and vanilla you mention. I think I still like the Cask Strength better than this one.
This is a top favourite of mine.
Yeah, that price oof. It's higher than the 18 used to be. 

I love Ardbeg, but I generally don't care for their special releases. They are usually too light and kind of boring. I haven't had Blaaack but yeah this Frog might beat the other Committee Release Ardbeg's I've tried or at least give them a run for their money
Very well said, completely agree. I think it's special because it's so unique in that regard of being a well aged Islay that is also bottled at a decent strength. It's definitely unique in Laphroaig's lineup
You did great if you paid $100 for this. MSRP is closer to $150

EDIT: it's apparently quite a bit cheaper in some places but $100 still seems like a great price
Same, for my tastes I still prefer the 10CS. But I think this is a very well done scotch and an interesting addition to their portfolio
I set up an alert and managed to get it from amazon for ¬£75.
$150?  Are there different bottlings?  I've only seen it for $100 here at our big chain.
Same‚ÄîI‚Äôm really glad I tried this one. I probably won‚Äôt buy it again, especially with the price. My bottle was $100 but now I‚Äôm seeing it as high as $150 in some places.
> Laphroaig 16

to add a reference point in CA the place with the cheapest prices I'm aware of has it for 140+tax
Prices can vary I guess, but that's a lot. From a quick search cheapest I see is $115 and $120. Most are closer to $140-$150. K&L has it for $140 and they are usually at or near MSRP. $120 would be about right for a slight markup at K&L. So still seems to me like $100 would be a great price, lucky you!
I've never seen it for any more than $100 as well"

American Whiskey review #233

***********

**""Jack Daniels Single Barrel"" Barrel Proof Rye, 66.4%**

**Nose:** Big clean rye notes of wintergreen and anise, pine, menthol, toffee, banana, bright caramel, delicious graham cracker, toasted oak. The mint and evergreen is so prominent but beautifully balanced by the sweet oak and the banana gives it unique character. Love it so far

**Taste:** Huge flavor, it really pops. Big explosion of sugary caramel, bright minty Rye notes, syrupy-sweet cherry, anise, sweet toasted oak, wintergreen, menthol spice. Has a syrupy thick mouthfeel with lots of sweetness but it feels bright and lively with all the Rye flavor that comes through. As a Rye fiend who loves big Rye flavor this really satisfies. Doesn't feel hot at all, huge flavor that pops and comes alive sharp and clean

**Finish:** Sharp minty Rye, sweet caramel, cherry, hot spice. Thick syrupy cherry and big minty Rye notes linger

***************

Fuck, this is a great Rye. It's bright and lively and sharp with tons of fresh Rye notes. The nose is fantastic and then the flavor is huge, it really pops and comes alive on the palate. I'm a major Rye fiend that takes the category very seriously. One thing I hate is when a Rye tastes too Bourbony, I like strong Rye character to come through. This stuff passes the test for me. A Rye that really satisfies

Liquid sex. That's what they should have named it. Great review.
Like everyone else said:

I really need to try this
Gonna be on the lookout for this. Was it distributed awhile ago, or still possible to find in the wild?
An absolute hitter or a bottle.  Hopefully it will be released again.
This bottle is so good
Best rye I ever had
I‚Äôve seen it available for $200. Is that too much? Don‚Äôt want to be a tater but if it‚Äôs a limited release then I don‚Äôt know if I should pass or not.
Your review talked it up immensely but then only an 8 rating. What other ryes would you consider higher, a 9 or a 10?
I gotta try this soon I‚Äôm a huge JD single barrels fan. I got myself a bottle of the single barrel select for my graduation over the spring it was amazing so much flavor.
I need this in my life!!
I have yet to see a barrel proof rye from JD,  but I really want to pick one up. The local stores rarely have any Brown Forman that‚Äôs over the OF 1920 proof. Which is a shame because I love their high proof stuff.
As a proud Kentuckian, I am offended this is on a bourbon sub ü§£

Never tried this one. Sounds good.
How are the non barrel proof versions of this and the JD bourbon? Are they worth picking up or is the barrel proof that much better?
[deleted]
What‚Äôs difference between green and gold label?
Yep, that seems to be the story with this stuff now unfortunately
Seems like all the JD single barrel, barrel proof is too good to pass up.
I definitely enjoy the notes of anise during sex!
>Liquid sex

I dunno about you, but that doesn‚Äôt sound like something I would like to drink.
~~It's a regular release from them now~~, but it is so hyped and hunted that you probably won't be able to find a bottle in the wild at a reasonable price. Good luck though!

EDIT: I was wrong, not a regular release. Jack Daniels webpage says that it is an annual release
Came out last November. In Ohio it was all gone in a week I think.
Secondary is about 260
8/10 is still an excellent score. But scoring is difficult and very subjective, so don't read into it too much haha. For me, A 10 is a rare event and 9 is basically as good as most stuff gets. 

Ryes that have scored better than this would be some of the older 7-10 year MGP single barrels from Willett and Smooth Ambler, and a few WhistlePig single barrels. Those are 95-100% rye mashbills that tend to be my favorite
The SBBP is huuuuuuge in Bananas Foster flavors
You and me both!
No, you need happiness. Rather than just filling the void where happiness and satisfaction with your life are supposed to be with Jack Daniel‚Äôs and Wild Turkey.
Unfortunately it is not comparable. The single barrel Rye (the easily available, 94 proof version) is decent whiskey, but it was never a top tier choice for me. This barrel proof is one of the best ryes I've ever had.

The barrel proof bourbon is pretty good if you like that ""bananas Foster"" note and a pretty hot ethanol kick. Barrel picks of it are widely available where I live in MN, and are priced reasonably. I've never been impressed enough with the non barrel proof version to buy a bottle. But then I don't buy much bourbon or rye under 100 proof, so you might consider me a ""proof hound"", or however that term goes.
Just so you know, any kind of alcohol buying or trading is prohibited on Reddit. Admins will ban you without warning for doing it, even via DM's
Yeah, even the Bourbon BP single barrel's are really good
Their SB BP releases are always killer in quality

Hence why JDSBBP is no longer nationally distributed and only available at (i think?)the distillery itself in Lynchburg. I gotta find a 2nd bottle somewhere
Same here, that's why I always use licorice whips.
Came back just for this secondary joke: 

You spelled anus wrong.
""liquid sex"" not ""sex liquid"".
>It's a regular release from them now, but it is so hyped and hunted that you probably won't be able to find a bottle in the wild at a reasonable price. Good luck though!

I'm pretty sure the Rye was a special release around the holidays last year.  I imagine they'll do it again this winter since it got such a huge reaction last season
I thought JD said they were not releasing it anymore and it was just a 2020 special release
Plenty of it sitting on shelves in Tampa. There‚Äôs even store picks collecting dust. It‚Äôs all at msrp too
I see it everywhere down here in Houston.
It‚Äôs around, you just need to do a bit of searching. It‚Äôs one of the few things I keep a backup of. It‚Äôs liquid banana bread to me.
I can find it on the shelf in Wisconsin no problem.
Edit: heavy allocation. I get it. Don't kill me with downvotes. I wasn't sure if i was correct, I just based my assumption off what i heard someone in the thread say a month or 2 ago
I knew this was you!!

https://youtu.be/5teVixi8XLU
Well I originally just meant the spice, then realized it was a pun and left it as is haha
I would drink sex liquid too, but that‚Äôs probably a discussion best saved for a different sub
You and another comment are right, my bad. Jack Daniels webpage says it is an annual release
You and another comment are right, my bad. Jack Daniels webpage says it is an annual release
Yeah it's in my grocery stores here in the bay area as well. One of the easier bottles to find. Places that don‚Äôt even have a good selection of whiskeys have it
Lucky bastards.
Cant find it anywhere in Vegas near me unless they just don't stock it often
I heard they stopped shipping SBBP nationally....unless i heard wrong
I clicked your profile, and we are both Phils fans and degenerates. We should be friends.

>Cant find it anywhere in Vegas near me unless they just don't stock it often

Drive down to Phoenix, it's at all the Total Wines, AJ's and Safeways here.
It's definitely here in Phoenix, even recent restocks.
You're wrong, but store picks are under heavy allocation right now.
Haha. Go figure. Are you from Delco like the rest of us degenerates?

Oddly, I'm a Phils fan because Schmidtty went to Ohio University (where my dad works) and I wanted to root for a guy from there. Been a fan since Lenny Dykstra and Kruk. I have been to Philly and I fit in well.

Scotch review #252

****************

**Benrinnes 1997 18 year, Gordon and Macphail ""Connoisseur's Choice,"" 1st fill sherry hogsheads 46%**

**Nose:** Thick and well balanced. Tons of honey, toffee, Sweet barley and cereal malt, vanilla, sweet mildly tart fruits dipped in caramel, sulfury malt, meaty with a faint balanced spice.

**Taste:** Caramel, bright barley sugar and lots of honey, sweet syrupy cherry, strawberry, happy sweet fruits, thick cereal malt, sweet vanilla. It feels bright and sweet and happy but maintains a thick and diginified Scotch feel at the same time. Delicious malt notes and tons of sweet fruit, it all melds into a thick and balanced proper Scotch. Fantastic stuff

**Finish:** Caramel, vanilla icing, barley sugar, honey malt, lightly sweet fruits, wonderful holiday spice. Just sweet and pleasant and oh so delicious to the end

*************

For first fill sherry tons of complex malt and cereal notes come through, I easily would have guessed a light sherry finish on this. It's excellent stuff. Like honeyed caramel fruits and malt. Has the huge flavor and thick mouthfeel of cask strength, but with the smooth drinkablilty of 46%. It's just a seriously impressive Scotch all around

Great review. I agree completely. Somehow has massive sherry flavor while not losing the underlying malt. This was absolutely fantastic in my opinion.
U/buckydean you nailed it. I have yet to have a bad sherried Benrinnes. Have you tried the Benrinnes 23?
That's because Benrinnes is a beast in sherry!

Great review u/buckydean
No, I never tried it. This might be my first benrinnes actually. I drank this to test the waters and see how I feel about maybe grabbing a K&L benrinnes. What do you think? https://klwines.com/p/i?i=1524628
Well, your first sounds amazing. I‚Äôve had several Benrinnes bourbon cask aged and while they were ok, just, ok. I‚Äôd try that 23 yo. Is it a bourbon cask aged?
It doesn't say, which yeah makes me think it's Bourbon or refill Bourbon
Yea. I had a 22 year old Benrinnes signatory bourbon cask aged that was, ok. It‚Äôs a great base spirit but seems to shine with a Sherry cask."

Brandy review #50

****************

**L'Encantada Domiane De Laoue #32, 1985 34 year, 48.1%**

**Nose:** Sweet cherry and dark grape fruitiness, chocolate, smooth tobacco, mellow spice, syrupy cherry, caramel, menthol, sweet wood. Beautiful chocolatey and  sweet fruity notes but it feels a bit too smooth and light, like it's struggling to get out

**Taste:** Syrupy sweet dark cherry, caramel, brief tobacco notes, antique wood, smooth toasted oak, some brighter sweet menthol spice, chocolate strawberry, grape. Like the nose it's delicious but feels a bit muted and light, like it's lacking punch and struggling to really come alive.

**Finish:** Cool peppery spice and sweet candy cherry, lingers into some smooth tannic wood and tobacco, chocolatey fruits. A quickish finish

**********************

Delicious with all the bold sweet fruit notes and big chocolatey oak I look for in yak, but the feel is light and lacking punch. If you're looking for typical bold fruity and oaky Armagnac notes but with a more smooth and delicate presentation, this is perfect. Even at the $200 price tag I probably wouldn't regret buying this, it's really good. But having tried it now I won't pursue it and instead look for the punchier yaks that I prefer. It's probably more personal preference than anything else though, because this a quality yak

**Stellum Rye, 58.12%**

**Nose:** Bold Rye right up front, crisp and clean, with lots of brown sugar sweetness, toasted oak, bright mint and evergreen, green apple, tingly menthol, dill, minty barrel char

**Taste:** Brown sugar, big sweet blast of herbal Rye spice, thick syrupy mouthfeel with nice Rye kick, caramel, brash oak, mint, thick clean Rye flavor, mild dill. It's strong yet well-balanced. A middle-of-the-road kind of character, never feels super oaky but never feels overly hot or spirity either. Just tons of thick bold Rye and sweetness

**Finish:** Bold Rye and dill, peppery and herbal rye spice that hits bright and hot, brown sugar, nice kicker of a rye finish but it stays thick and balanced

**************

A really solid Rye with plenty of bold Rye character, which is just the way I like it. It's straightforward and could use maybe a little more age and oak for my tastes, but for what it is and for the price it's a winner. A great addition to the Whiskey aisle for Rye fans. It stops juuust short of greatness though I think

Is the ‚ÄúTennessee‚Äù rye in this Dickel Rye, and therefore actually Indiana rye? I think this has been true with some of the Barrell batches, and I am not aware of any Tennessee distillers known to be sourcing rye.
What is the best MGP rye?
Nice review. I recently tried the Stellum bourbon and thought it also did a great job of not being hot for its proof. Sounds like the rye may have a bit more character than what I got from the bourbon. May need to give it a try
Could be. Dickel might be aging MGP stuff in their own barrels on site and then sourcing them out. I honestly don't know if they are making their own Rye or not. Or possibly Tennessee Distilling Company, who I just learned of and don't know much about. They appear to source stuff out and not have a brand of their own. I wouldn't think Jack Daniels would be supplying stuff like this. 

My Barrell Seagrass bottling also uses sourced ""Tennessee Rye"" so I'm curious what the answer is, maybe someone smarter than me can answer
The best? Probably The 7-10 year single barrels that Willett and Smooth Ambler Old Scout used to put out. Those are long gone though

Best stuff you can still get? I've loved The Nashville Barrel Company I had and also the Redemption 10 year Barrel Proof. A notch below those but still really good would be Senator and some of the Barrell stuff I've had
Yeah I really enjoyed both the Stellum expressions, especially at the price point. It‚Äôs pretty close, but I think the Rye is my favorite of the two.
I just opened my bottle of Stellum Rye.  It's definitely packing a kick but almost has a sweetness to it and some spicy aftertaste.
This is the way.
I just picked up the bourbon yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed it, now I have to go back to Total Wine for the rye. Love the price point as well, especially considering the proof."

They are pretty much impossible to find and sell for much higher on secondary.

American Whiskey review #231

**********

**Weller Antique 107 single barrel select, Kansas City Whiskey Society, 53.5%**

**Nose:** Buttery and creamy, butterscotch, maple, amazing cinnamon coffee cake note with tingly cinnamon spice, toffee, musty toasted wood, sweet vanilla char. A buttery bomb, sweet and creamy, amazing nose

**Taste:** Bright clean caramel, maple, cherry, sweet toasted wood, orange toffee, butterscotch, vanilla, some bright cinnamon and brash wood spice, a little musty funk. It's very bright and sweet and happy, definitely fits the bill of what I look for in a Wheater. It's not quite as thick and creamy as the nose was, but the flavor is all fantastic. As a big Wheater fan I'm loving this stuff

**Finish:** Buttery sweet toffee, bright cherry and mouthwarming cinnamon spice, lingering creamy caramel. Wow nice warm and creamy finish with a warm layer of spice

***********

I'm a shameless fan of Wheated Bourbon, and this Weller is a perfect example of why. It's hard to find the big sweet and creamy notes you get in these. The next best thing for me might be some Maker's Mark stuff, especially the newer wood finishing series. But these Weller single barrels always have an elegant simplicity to them that easily beats any MM I've had. No extra spice or brashness or big bruiser flavors to them, just lots of creamy sweetness with a hint of delicious cinnamon spice. These picks are always great in my experience and this one is no exception

**Taste:** Settles more into thick and balanced flavor. It's like thick creamy orange syrup with a happy boldness that pops, sweet orange candy, floral orange blossom, mild ester funk, friendly spice. Always so hard to review an eau-de-vie, it basically tastes like the thing but with much more complexity than that. Long story short this does a fantastic job with the thing 

**Finish:** Estery alcohol stays balanced with lingereing sweet floral orange, very nice candy-sweet orangey and floral finish

Great stuff. You pretty much know what you are signing up for if you've ever tasted and orange or had orange candy, so all I can really say is that they have pulled it off extremely well.

I use this to make cosmopolitans. You use this instead of lemon vodka and then use homemade Limoncello instead of Cointreau. It‚Äôs fantastic.
I was curious how they were making an orange brandy, when I‚Äôve heard that fermenting orange juice can lead to nasty flavors caused by butyric acid. After some research, turns out store bought orange juice can contain ethyl butyrate which is added by producers to enhance flavors and causes the nasty smells. Using fresh pressed juice will avoid that situation. 

Anyway, just a fun fact for the curious ones out there."

**Nose:** Thick caramel and toffee, malt, strong ocean brine, honey, flawlessly well-integrated layers of fruits with soft berry, cherry, rich plum, apple. It has a thick and elegantly well-balanced feel. Beautiful nose

**Taste:** Decadent caramel, thick honey, malt, brine, soft layers of fruits, chocolate, warm grape, plum, strawberry, soft tart berry, sweet spice. It's very fruity but it's such a soft and well-integrated fruitiness. The flavor all flows very naturally. Complex but thick and elegant. It's like malty salted caramel covered fruit. So much caramel, not what I was expecting from a wine-aged Islay

**Finish:** Soft tart fruits, sweet spice, milk chocolate, decadent caramel and malt. All the big flavor flows smoothly all the way to the finish, with lingering nutty maltiness and caramel and soft fruits

**************

This isn't just an excellent Scotch. It tastes amazingly well crafted. You can end up with a lot of these competing flavors in any ol' wine aged malt, but this has combined all these complex flavors extremely well. And I don't think the ""Manzanilla"" tells the whole story here. There is so much delicious caramel and chocolate here that I think the original wood used must have been some very special stuff. All of it together is so thick and complex yet so elegant, the flavor just flows very naturally. Way more going on here than just a big fruity wine bomb. It's very much a Scotch first and foremost, and a briny Islay Scotch at that, with layers of honey and warm well-integrated fruits

I have a 10 year Bunna single barrel (2009) from a first fill Butte. At a whopping 68.5 percent, I thought it would be ass and peat. Shares many of the notes you describe, and is damn near a perfect Scotch imo. Cheers!
AI driven social media sucks. So does SH.
Nice review!  This was one of my favorites in recent memory.  I ordered a 2nd bottle and recently finished the first.  Expensive, but worth the money in this case.  I‚Äôve found the the specific ‚Äúdrinking sherry‚Äù casks like manzanilla, amontillado, and palo cortado can really make Bunnahabhain shine.
Nice Review! I had a 20cl bottle of a Manzanilla Bunnahabhain once and loved it I think Manzanilla works brilliantly with their style really bringing out that salted caramel note.
Sounds great.  If fully Manzanilla matured it is likely the cask was American oak which can be the source of those caramel notes.  And just plain good casks.  It's one of the reasons I'm often drawn to these other sherries.  Fino, Manzanilla, Amontillado and Palo Cortado.  They generally are a better cask.
I have this. Yet to open it.  Excited to try it based on your review.
Is it an ""Ultimate"" bottling? I've seen several of those Bunnas with similar specs, those things are beasts
Agreed. As much as I loved it I dont think I could do it for $200
Here‚Äôs the thing about spending $200+ on this bottle: you are guaranteed to enjoy it. You already know that it‚Äôs good. If you have ever gambled on a whisky for 60 bucks and been disappointed, and then a few years later did the same thing again. And a few years later did the same‚Ä¶ would you not give up those three sub par bottle for a guaranteed enjoyment? Or even if you spend $100 a month on whisky. Pull off a dry month and reward it with a more expensive bottle that tastes good. Drink less, drink better.
What about Oloroso? Are the Fini and Manzanila casks higher quality to prevent overpowering the more delicate nature of those sherries?
I opened mine when my daughter was born with my brother to celebrate. I only have half of it left. It‚Äôs probably the best scotch I‚Äôve ever had. If there is a better one then please recommend it as I can only think of highland park 15 cask strength as a contender.
No, signatory release. Some 600ish bottles of this disappeared very quickly
Oloroso is often in either for seasoning, but maturation to produce drinking quality wine will be done American oak.
Interesting there's so many similar casks around from different bottlers, I wonder if they are all coming from the same place. My ""The Ultimate"" bottle is 2009 1st fill sherry 67%
It is suggested that Ultimate buys most of if not all of their stock through Signatory and you do sometimes see others with parts of Signatory parcels.  The SCN Clynelish 23 for instance and some SMOS bottlings."

**Wild Turkey Rare Breed Rye, 56.1%**

**Nose:** Toffee, strong herbal notes, cinnamon spice, strong minty Rye notes, mellow toasted oak. Lots of spice, it's somewhere between nice herbal/cinnamon Rye spice and a thin hot kick. I dig the nose.

**Taste:** Tinny caramel, hot cherry, hot spice kick, some herbal and mint rye notes, cinnamon blast. Decent flavor and it's not overly Bourbon-y which is what I usually hate about Kentucky Ryes. Some nice Rye flavor does come through but it just feels a little too hot and thin. Not bad, just rough around the edges

**Finish:** Cinnamon spice blast and sweet brash cherry, thin caramel, wood spice. Again leaves with some nice lingering spicy Rye flavor but overall it's just lacking a bit in body and feel

*****************

It's a solid Rye, but nothing amazing. I think the Rare Breed Bourbon is much more impressive. For a similar price if you can find it I like Willett 4 year a lot more. But if you can't find Willett then this might be one of the better Rye offereings in this price range from what I've seen. I should mention that I'm a Rye fiend and usually chase 95-100% mashbill stuff, so this stuff wins some major points for at least tasting like a proper Rye. Some of that barely legal mashbill stuff out there is barely distinguishable from a Bourbon.

I want to try this, but I can't not buy RRSiB rye instead.
I find this bottle to be absolutely stellar. It‚Äôs big, bold, and high proof. One of my absolutely favorite ryes out there. I give it an 8.
The Rye 101 isn't bad either
Nice review! It‚Äôs been near impossible for me to find here in Northern Illinois. I ended up giving up and trying Stellum Rye since I had the money burning a hole in my pocket, and am super pleased I did. I‚Äôve tried RBR, Willett 4 and Stellum Rye and prefer the Stellum by a large margine. All three are great, though!
I ended up getting a bottle of the RB rye at total wine for 60$ and although it‚Äôs not my favorite it‚Äôs definitely good. Your rank seems fair. I do much prefer the original rare breed.
It's good, but Pikesville for $15 less is my go-to for barrel-proof rye.
She‚Äôs a hot girl for sure. Slow sipper for me. Thanks for the review
My only complaint about RB Rye is that it is $15 more than regular RB for seemingly no reason other than Ryes being the hype thing currently.
I have a bottle and I like it, not love it.  Yes it is good but for the price, $56 retail Houston, I much prefer Mitchers single barrel straight rye at $46.  While the Rare Breed was nice to drink neat, it didn't stand up to making a Manhattan.  The Mitcher's works for me neat or in a Manhattan.  Personally, my favorite every day pour rye and favorite for Manhattan's is Old Forrester rye at $26.

Do I like it?  Yes.  Do I recommend it? Yes.  Will I buy it again?  Maybe.
I really need to revisit this bottle. A friend who I always trade bottles with brought me one of these at New Years and I found it almost sickeningly sweet. I haven‚Äôt touched it since, but the last month or so I have been focusing on Rye so I will make it a point to give it a second chance.
Can you make some Rye rec's? I am a fan as well, and I am sure I may know a lot of what's out there, but always love hearing from a drinker what they have come across and enjoyed.  Never know if someone's adventurous palate discovered something I may have passed by before.

Speaking of...I tried the Elijah Craig SB Rye - a little sweet, but for the price, a solid pour. I am a sucker for HH stuff though, so I am likely biased.
It is good, sounds like you maybe just enjoyed it a little more than I did. That's great though, everyone's gonna have their own tastes
Much better value, too.  You can get almost 3 bottles of the 101 rye here for the price of one of these.
Thanks for reading! I haven't had Stellum but I'll be trying it soon I think. Are you talking about their Cask Strength?
Where are you finding the Stellum Rye in northern IL if I may ask? I‚Äôm in Dekalb and haven‚Äôt seen it around.
Take a trip to Total Wine in Wisconsin. We got plenty.
It could also be due to the fact that rye is a more expensive commodity than corn.
As I mentioned I usually go for 95-100% mashbill stuff which is mostly WhistlePig and MGP. I always love the WhistlePig 10 single barrel store picks, and The Senator 6 year is a solid MGP Rye that can be found. Nashville Barrel Company does some good MGP Rye from what I've had and heard. Also Barrell. Those are all pricier options and harder to find though. In the cheaper price bracket, Willett 4 year and to a lesser extent this Rare Breed are a couple of the better ""strong Rye character"" Ryes I've had. I've heard good things about New Riff but I wasn't big fan of their BIB Rye. Maybe someone can chime in with other suggestions
I think Stellum only offers the 116 proof rye (no ""regular"" strength). It's very good and better than the WT RB for roughly the same price, imo.
Yep! I drinks well below the proof though.
OMG Liqour in Yorkville has 1 bottle left as of Friday. Ronick is the owner and a great dude, tell him Ben sent you (call first to make sure he still has it).
It‚Äôs on Taste Select Repeat if you want to get it shipped.
 Where in Wisconsin are you? I am in central WI an have a hard time finding large selections other than Discount in Milwaukee.
Is it? I didn't realize. I've always heard about rye being used in climates with especially harsh conditions (which is why it's more prevalent in Canada). I never considered the cost of the grain.
I don‚Äôt think the grain is a huge factor in the end price unless they‚Äôre sourcing some uber-fancy strain of something. Buffalo Trace claims it takes $21 million to fill one of their new warehouses that store 55,000 barrels with white dog. I understand they‚Äôre buying in crazy volumes (with respect to whiskey) but so is Wild Turkey. Take away the cost of the barrel, because those aren‚Äôt cheap, and you‚Äôre left with a product that only costs a few dollars per gallon to make. Again that‚Äôs at a massive scale, but Wild Turkey would be similar. The cost components in whiskey that have the biggest impact are distribution, tax, retail markup, and time spent in the barrel. Take all that away and you‚Äôre just drinking illegal moonshine. Also shitty vodka has production costs in the ballpark of a few dollars per gallon, so that‚Äôs another validator that the type of grain chosen isn‚Äôt a huge factor in cost of production for a mass-produced liquor. Yeah rye might be 2x, 3x, or 4x the price of corn but it only changes the equation for one part of the process.
Check out Wilderness Trail Settlers Select Rye. One of my favorite ryes after you open it and give it some time to open up.
I do love that Willet...especially the Estate Rye when you can nab it at Cask Strength (SO good).  Never heard of the Senator...have to give it a look.   


Try Pikesville Rye if you get a chance...solid BiB Rye for the price point.
I quite like the Whistlepig 6 year, and that usually comes at a more affordable price point than some of their other offerings. Very drinkable neat in my experience, and can definitely shine in a cocktail.
Oh I didn't realize that about the Rye, that's interesting then. Thanks for the info u/booger_dick
My nearest Total Wine is Bayshore. They always seem to have it in stock. They have a good selection, just don't plan on ever getting anything from Buffalo Trace.
Historically, yes, rye will cost more. A quick check of the markets shows that corn prices are on the rise, probably due to drought affecting the 2021 harvest yield, and rye prices are about 13% lower than they were this time last year.
I'm guessing OP isn't a fan of Pikesville due to the mashbill, but I agree that it's pretty amazing. He mentioned Barrell‚ÄîI got a bottle of Seagrass recently and it's totally blowing my mind! I haven't seen it mentioned here yet, but Alberta Premium is pretty fantastic stuff, though tough to find. Lastly (but certainly not least-ly), Old Forester Rye is So. Damn. Delicous! It's another one that's probably a little low in the mashbill for OP, but there's not another bottle under $30 in the whiskey world that I enjoy more than OF Rye.
Yup, same for the bourbon too! They're both right in that 115-proof area. Same guys who make Barrell, as you're probably aware.
 Thanks for the info! I will check them out.

 I have found a pretty decent place in Appleton, WI - Flanagan's Stop and Shop.
Nice. Thanks for teaching me something.
What‚Äôs your general thoughts on the Seagrass? I had a chance to nab a bottle (never tried it) but at $95, I couldn‚Äôt get myself to pull the trigger on it
It‚Äôs a very delicious mix of traditional spicy rye flavors with both rich dark and light fruits (big apricot flavor for me). I think it‚Äôs exceptional, but I totally get your hesitation. I‚Äôll parrot what others say here that Barrell is one of the most consistent near-$100 bottles available. I‚Äôd gladly pay that again for another bottle of this, dovetail, and their bourbon releases. However, I read lots of reviews before purchase and already knew that I really liked Barrell going in. 

Dovetail is probably a safer and less polarizing release, but if you‚Äôre a big fan of rye and you like new and bold flavors, Seagrass might be a hit for you.
Gotcha, thanks for your perspective, and taking the time to write it out!
You‚Äôre welcome!"
"Review #557: Wild Turkey 9 year Single Cask Nation, 57.85%",,https://i.redd.it/uc768od9cvb71.jpg,"Using some kind of crazy influence and connections, Single Cask Nation (who usually bottle Scotch) is occasionally able to pick Wild Turkey barrels and bottle them at full strength. It's the only true full proof, single barrel version of Wild Turkey out there these days that I know of. And from a great independent Scotch bottler at that. These sold via a lottery system for $101 each, this is one of the 2 latest barrels that were recently released 

American Whiskey review #229

*******************

**Wild Turkey 9 year Single Cask Nation, rickhouse E 4th floor, 57.85%**

**Nose:** Smooth musty oak, woody caramel, warm cinnamon spice, mild tannic notes of cigar and leather, some of that sweet cherry fruit hiding in all the chocolatey wood. Very much reminds me of a rich woody-smooth dusty Turkey profile

**Taste:** Big sweet toasted oak, very clean, smooth bold corn, bright fruity cherry and cinnamon, chocolatey toasted oak, caramel, some musty wood. After the more oaky nose this is sleek and sweet. I'm loving all the corn flavor and sweet fruitiness, but still plenty of delicious smooth oakiness and must. All effortlessly balanced like Wild Turkey can do so well

**Finish:** Sweet caramel, smooth toasted oak, friendly blast of sweet sweet cinnamon spice and Bourbon corn. Sweet and bright for a Wild Turkey, but still super balanced and smooth. Delicious til the end

****************

A really fun Turkey. It definitely has some hallmark WT flavors going on, but also has a fun and unique character. It feels sweet and clean, almost bright even. And it has that effortless quality I love in a good Wild Turkey, like it's just so darn delicious and drinkable without even trying very hard. Big flavor that doesn't need to pummel you. This does that extremely well. I like when they are maybe a little more oaky than this but no complaints this is delicious

I was so bummed to miss out on this lottery.
I got lucky and got this bottle through the online lotto.  Great review of it and I completely agree that it's got huge flavor and high abv but not at all brash or heavy heat.  haven't had it in a few weeks but your notes sound pretty spot on as well.  Cheers!
Sweet and bright Wild Turkey sounds great. SCN nailed it with their first two Turkeys and this sounds like another winner. Thanks for the review
Thanks for the review!  I was totally confused when I saw these pop up on social media. I‚Äôd love to know how it all works.

Oh man 9yr Turkey Barrel Proof sounds so god damn good, even just on paper. Damn.
Right on! For the price it's a no-brainer, fantastic Turkey bottling not like anything else you'll be able to get. I entered the lotto but didn't win anything"
"Review #556: Clynelish 1998 15 year G&M Cask Strength, refill sherry casks 58%",,https://i.redd.it/b60v109jmtb71.jpg,"Scotch review #250

******************

**Clynelish 1998 15 year, Gordon and Macphail Cask Strength, refill sherry casks, 58%**

**Nose:** Thick honey and waxy malt, orange, toffee, tart and sweet fruitiness, light berry and strawberry, mild wine funk, light wood spice. Well rounded and delicious nose, very balanced, comes together beautifully

**Taste:** Friendly and approachable but bright with a nice oily mouthfeel. Honey and warm fruits, lemon, waxy malt, syrupy thick caramel, graham cracker pie crust, pastry, mellow sweet strawberry and cherry fruitiness. Just the right balance of Scotch-y caramel malt notes and sweet fruits. Exactly what I look for in a refill sherry bottle with a light yet noticable sherry influence. Great stuff

**Finish:** Sweet red fruits and bright lemon, spice kick, mellows back into honeyed caramel, graham cracker, waxy maltiness. Lingering fruity sweetness and caramel. 

**************

Perfectly embodies everything I love about a good refill sherry Scotch. Plenty of bold malty Scotch notes with a light touch of sweet fruity sherry. This one is very sweet but it all strikes a perfect balance and makes for a delicious experience that is hard to put down. So drinkable. Great mouthfeel at 58% too, full flavored but still smooth and no trace of heat. Clynelish is hit and miss for me but this one is a winner. 

A few cool points I noticed reading the Whiskybase page. This is apparently a blend of two casks, and it was distilled on my 16th birthday in 1998(I'll save you the math and just tell you I'm 38)

Man I miss that line of bottlings. Since the redesign everything seems less good and pricier.
Damn, that sounds good. I want a bottle of that. Waxy malt, ahhh. Another great review. Congrats on 250!
man that sounds good, Clynelish is still one of my favorite, always go to scotches. Thanks!
I've only had a few and they were all solid. I'll definitely keep an eye out for any other dusty ones sitting around
Thanks dude! You've certainly helped inspire a few of them haha
I just love Clynelish and this one sounds quite good. Do you know if this one is any way available?
No, I tried it from an old sample. No idea where this would be found sorry. But thatfamousgrouse commented that these older G&M Cask Strength bottlings were really good in general if you ever find any of them
Good to know. The hunt continues."
"Review #555: Springbank 10 ""Local Barley"" Oloroso sherry casks, 55.6%",,https://i.redd.it/uthzeqqc5wa71.jpg,"Price on this bottle is in the $150-$175 range 

Scotch review #249

***********

**Springbank 10 ""Local Barley"" 2020, Oloroso sherry casks, 55.6%**

**Nose:** Chocolate strawberry jam, fudgy chocolate, toffee and Scotchy malt, thick toasted oak, brine and light funky smoke, tart berry, salted chocolate fudge, a beautiful undercurrent of minty wood spice and anise. It's fudgy and jammy, hits with a warm thickness but no heat. Fantastic

**Taste:** Cereal malt comes through surprisingly thick and clean, rich caramel, bright black cherry and fruit notes settle into well-balanced weet jammy sherry notes, warm holiday spice, big warming strawberry, chocolate, smooth toasted wood, mild springbank funk. There's so much warm jammy sweetness, it's a really thick yet velvety soft sherry influence with lots of chocolate fudge and malt and just enough warm tingly spice. Just a touch of funk and oak to remind you you're drinking a Springbank

**Finish:** Beautiful milk chocolate and toffee, jammy sweet strawberry, tart dark berries, soft undercurrent of spice. Not an explosive finish, it oozes thick and fudgy and darkly sweet

**************

Pretty amazing bottle. All the notes combine together really well to create a sludgy thick and chocolatey sherry bomb, with all the fruit nores being jammy and sweet and warm. I often feel like aging these Local Barley bottlings in anything other than Bourbon barrels is kind of a waste, since the whole point is to showcase a local barley malted with care at the distillery. I still kind of feel that way, but there is no denying how amazing this stuff is. And actually a surprising amount of clean barley character does come through on the palate. The price is a little difficult though, I'm torn on whether I will get it or not

Haven't had anything bad from Campbelltown. Really great stuff
I think this bottle retails around $150 but is impossible to buy at retail, grey market prices are at $500-600 per bottle.
I'm kind of torn about this bottle. I managed to pick it up for EUR105 by a stroke of luck. Since then I have seen that it is selling for 450 plus at auction. The temptation is definitely there to sell it and reinvest the money in 4 excellent but less hyped bottles and drink them.
Thanks for the review of this. This is the second positive review I've read in the past few days. Just killed a15 OB and agree with others here that it is one very good bottle.
that kind of stuff should be tested blind  imo, tooooo many hype around that particular bottle.  when i tried blind testing  of sb 15 and 21  i picked 15 as winner i doubt that i would pick 15 if i had known.  i have 25cl sample... waiting for cold weather to try it
MRSP in the UK was like 90¬£; in the US it was $199. Getting it for $150-$175 involves having some great connections, as far as I‚Äôve seen.
In hindsight this is what I should have done. In my opinion it is an excellent bottle of whisky, well worth the 105‚Ç¨ and more. But is it worth 500-ish or 4 other very good bottles you can get for that price? No. I do have another one and i‚Äôm not sure if I should sell it now or keep it for 10 years and see what happens with the price
I agree, blind is a great way to taste things like this. But unfortunately we can't exactly pick the things that we get to taste blind or it wouldn't be blind. But I like to think I enter these reviews objectively and I didn't really have a lot riding on this or anything. It was from a sample so I don't have a bottle I'm trying to justify buying. Of course there could always be some bias involved but I try to minimize it. And honestly, it's excellent but I was hoping it might do just a little better based on all the hype and get closer to a 9/10
Funny I recently did a 8 single cask, 15 OB, 28 single cask, all sherry comparison and 15 for me was also the best (couldn't do it blind because I knew them too well)

There is something about the balance of spirit and wood
I agree. This is a fine whisky, but the hype is definitely skewing reviews.
Agreed.  The current 15yo OB is better than many single cask and society releases of Springbank I‚Äôve had.
I actually won one in a local lottery, checked the grey market pricing and it seems to be around 500 euros.
I know, I‚Äôve seen that too. I‚Äôm just saying the stated price range is on the low end for the US release.
Just under $200 in DC."

It's a similar bottling but this one is a 1998 20 year while the currently available one is a 2000 20 year. Interestingly, I assumed ""1st fill hogshead"" on this one meant Bourbon and reviewed it as such. But according to K&L, this 1st fill hogshead is ""likely a mixture of ex-bourbon and sherry.""

Scotch review #248

*********

**Tamdhu 1998 20 year, Old Malt Cask K&L pick, 1st fill hogshead, 56.7%**

**Nose:** Thick malt, lots of rich caramel, orange zest, beautifully balanced toasted wood, toasted and nutty, vanilla, warm wood spice. Malty with nice rich wood notes and it's all extremely well balanced in that nice aged way

**Taste:** Caramel, brown sugar, thick smooth maltiness, sweet pastry, bright barley sugar and citrus, friendly toasted oak, vanilla, mild spice. It's a simple and straightforward dram but very satisfying. The easygoing sugary barley and light caramel wood notes are very balanced, it's pleasant in a sweet and ""Scotchy"" kind of way. Tastes like a crowd pleaser

**Finish:** Sweet pastry malt and vanilla icing, sugary barley, brown sugar, light smooth caramel, darkens into some lingering barrel char and mild wood spice. Stays sweet and balanced with some friendly complexity

**************

It stays friendly and sweet for being 1st fill with so much age on it. Not huge and dramatic, it's not even what I would call a malt bomb. But the barley and friendly wood notes are so delicious and balanced in that way that age can accomplish extremely well. It's the kind of stuff I like to describe as being very ""Scotchy"" if that makes any sense. Just thoroughly pleasant and drinkable, a very well aged Scotch.

American Whisk(e)y review #228

***************

**Balcones 2015 4 year Texas single malt, Single Cask Nation, 60.9%**

**Nose:** Rich toffee, chocolate fudge, heavily toasted wood and barrel char, graham cracker, creamy pastry, wood spice. Has a creamy quality along with all the brash Bourbony wood, great mix of styles

**Taste:** Big hot blast of flavor. Brash toasted wood and big peppery spice kick, cinnamon, caramel, hot cherry, sweet funky malt, some mild oaky and spirity bitterness. It's good but a cacaphony of flavors. Some water tones it down a bit, brings out a vague kind of sweet creamy thickness, woody caramel, bitter cacoa, menthol. It's nice but I think I prefer it brasher.

**Finish:** Funky malt and spice, sweet toasted wood, vanilla, menthol and cinnamon spice. A nice sweet oaky and malty finish with a sweet spice kick

*************

Good stuff and a very interesting style. I like the mix of worlds with the sweet creamy malt and big brash Bourbony wood, it maybe just doesn't quite come together as something I would want to drink over and over or own a bottle of. A really fun sample though. It's a little rough on it's own but I think I prefer it that way, because adding just a little bit of water leveled it out too much and made it a tad boring imo. Really enjoyed this stuff though

Glad you picked this instead of the Baby Blue, only bourbon so far that left with an upset stomach and a weird after taste.
Agree about the Balcones Baby Blue. Not a fan.

But the single malt is so good if you put a drop of it on your hat your tounge will beat your brains out trying to get to it.
Just saw this, looove Balcones Single Malt. Those Cask Strength Picks are amazing, and even Lineage I go through a lot which is like the lil bro to Cask Strength Single Malt. Local store just did a single malt pick recently and Total Wine has a pick as well.

Whenever I just want something great and different and don't feel like pouring  bourbon or scotch (even though Balcones leans far more towards latter), just hits the spot including Lineage.

If you haven't had Brimstone do so, if you've ever had Nikka Coffey Malt it's literally like the 'Murica version, extremely similar but that toasted blue corn is different. https://i.imgur.com/EP0Jo6U.jpg

Huge fan of what Balcones is doing, something I wouldn't say years ago and I wonder if it's b/c in those years got heavy into scotch and there's a lot of similarities.
Baby Blue is a corn whisky not a Bourbon. And yes, it is terrible. I don‚Äôt see how it could make you sick, unless you are allergic to corn.
I found it too sweet and syrupy, more than my body wanted to deal with at least.  Same kind of feeling after drinking too many Mike Hard‚Äôs or etc.
You might have a corn allergy. Baby Blue contains no sugar since its all distilled without anything added.
I think this dude would have a lot more indication about being allergic to corn in eating every day items, compared to drinking a few corn whiskies. The allergens (proteins) are *mostly* eliminated during distillation."

Scotch review #247

************

**Hazelburn 2007 11 year single cask, re-charred Bourbon hogshead, 55.1%**

**Nose:** Nice malty nose with a heavy dose of brine. Pastry malt, bready, buttery and sweet,clean coastal brine, sweet lightly toasted oak, vanilla, strong peppery spice blast. Delightful malt bomb but with nice spice and brininess that keeps it from feeling too friendly. Love love love this nose 

**Taste:** Oh yeah, and the flavor delivers. Bright blast of citrus and caramel, sugary Nilla wafer, you could chew on this, sweet toasted wood, bright spice kick, tons of thick sweet malt, pastry notes, buttercream, coastal brine, vanilla. Some nice gritty char and toasted wood on the end. It feels very bright and crisp and clean but with a thick oily mouthfeel at the same time, the maltiness is on full display and does extremely well. Damn this is seriously good.

**Finish:** Sweet sugary malt, bright citrus, sweet vanilla and lightly toasted wood. A long sugary sweet and malty finish, all the flavor is just perfect

***********

This is fucking phenomenal. It's a malt bomb and definitely on the sweeter side. It is bright and happy and creamy with a sugary sweetness but has a seriously hefty feel at the same time. It all just clicks and works so well. One of those Scotches where everything falls into place right where it needs to be. As someone who loves a good malt bomb this one is very special

Hazelburn is very underrated IMO.
Man this sounds tasty, a well executed ex-bourbon scotch is a thing of beauty!

Love a malty, sweet dram! Buttery bread notes are so nice to find!
Super jealous. I tried an 8 year old Hazelburn bourbon cask years ago and have been trying to recapture that profile ever since. This sounds similar enough that I‚Äôd love to have some. 

http://cocktailchem.blogspot.com/2012/09/whisky-review-hazelburn-8-year-bourbon.html
Love a Hazelburn - your notes sounds like mine from the standard 10 year old, amped up a few notches. Will look out for this.
My mouth is watering reading this review
Nice review! I actually just found a bottle of this a couple weeks ago and decided to grab it. Very excited to try it after your review!
This bottle/cask is stellar, I agree with your malt bomb descriptor. Great review, glad you enjoyed it!
Bought the 13 year yesterday and very excited about it . This review makes me more excited
Agreed. Unfortunately though the price is still pretty high on them
Agreed! This is a style that I really love and is deceptively hard to pull off well
Just read your review, and yes that does sound like a very similar profile. It's just magical, I can see why you are trying to recapture it. I'll be keping an eye out too
Nice! You found a bottle of this same 11 year re-charred Bourbon hogshead? How much was it?
Recently found this bottle in Vegas for 140
So i grabbed without thinking
Yeah I was in Arizona and there were actually three different liquor stores that had this in stock. A couple of them were like 180-190, but one of them had it for 130 or 140 (can‚Äôt quite remember), that‚Äôs the one I picked up. 

A high price to pay for an 11 year old, but that seems to be about right for anything springbank in the US. And unfortunately I‚Äôve loved everything hazelburn I‚Äôve had so I couldn‚Äôt pass it up haha.
Nice! Yeah sounds like it‚Äôs a good purchase!
What part of AZ?
I think I found them in the Tempe area.
Thanks. I'll do some exploring this weekend and see what I can find. Live in downtown PHX and haven't stopped into many stores in the Tempe-area aside from Total Wine."

Brandy review #48

*************

**Daniel Bouju ""Royal"" Grande Champagne Cognac, brut de fut 60%**

**Nose:** Wow, what a nose. You can really feel the heat but it's got tons of flavor and depth. Smoth dark fruits, grape, burnt plum, strawberry, toffee, black cherry cough syrup, lots of hot tingly menthol and wood spice, deeply toasted and charred oak, vanilla, tobacco, fudgy chocolate. Some dry and bitter wood, soy sauce type notes but stays leveled out and approachable 

**Taste:** Doesn't drink nearly as hot as I thought it would. Thick syrupy cherry, big chocolatey and darkly toasted wood, bright pop of bold grape and wood spice, toffee, vanilla, charred and toasted, warmer grape and strawberry fruitiness. healthy dose of bitter tannic wood and tobacco. The wood notes on this are dark and complex, so delicious. All the flavor melds extremely well with a thick syrupy mouthfeel. 

**Finish:** Dry wood notes, smooth thick caramel, sweet vanilla, barrel char, warm chocolatey grape, hint of wood spice. The finish levels out into a more cognacy feel with smooth balanced sweetness, still quite woody and boldly fruity but it all feels a little more elegant. Excellent finish

*******************

I love this! I tend to prefer Armagnac so I always get excited when I find a Cognac I enjoy this much. It's quite bold and woody for a Cognac though granted. It still holds onto it's Cognac character I think, with the elegnat fruitiness and drier wood notes. The nose is almost like a hot Bourbon except it's way too fruity, but then on the palate it's not hot at all. It uses every bit of that 60% abv to deliver tons of huge flavor with a thick syrupy mouthfeel.

Score: **8**

"Review #550: Willett 4 year Small Batch Rye, 55.4%",,https://i.redd.it/dm8xe0oygp871.jpg,"These go for about $60, but I think they are hard to find in certain places and might have secondary value to varying degrees

American Whiskey review #227

****************

**Willett Family Estate 4 year small batch Rye, 55.4%**

**Nose:** Impressive nose, I've always loved the strong rye character these have. Toffee, tons of cool delicious rye, bright mint, crisp clean herbal notes, bold rye spice, cherry, sweet toasted wood. Right off the bat it's fiercely rye but feels very mature and balanced, not young or spirity at all. 

**Taste:** After the thick minty toffee nose it comes alive with a bang on the palate in all the right ways. Hot cherry and big brash toasted wood, lots of mint and big herbal rye flavor with peppery spice, once the initial lively kick settles down there is darker notes of toffee and chocolate, graham cracker, dark cherry, wood spice. The wood notes are really nice for being so young but mostly it's just tons of bold vibrant rye I love it.

**Finish:** Thick minty rye that just keeps coming, fruity cherry, layers of delicious herbal rye spice. Has a lingering sweet minty rye flavor that tingles on the tongue. 

*****************

Always impressed by how well this stuff drinks at the young age. As a Rye fiend who usually tends towards the 95-100% mashbills of MGP and WhistlePig this satisfies the Rye itch very nicely. It's such a fiercely strong Rye with tons of big bold Rye flavor. The young age obviously helps it retain that strong Rye character, but it never feels overly hot or young. Very balnced with just the right kind of kick. It's missing the deeper chocolatey toasted oak and vanilla notes you would get with more age but it's so vibrant the way it is. I love it and as always I look forward to seeing this stuff with more age on it

Yeah it‚Äôs the only bottle I ‚Äúhunt‚Äù these days. Affordable, sometimes findable. Fuck the unicorns
Probably my favorite rye of all time.
Nice review. Have you had Pikesville rye? If so, how do you think they compare? Wondering if this is worth the step up in price. Thanks!
Opened my first bottle of it this weekend.  Immediately became my favorite rye.  Had it next to the Rare Breed Rye and the Old Scout Rye....both are great...but not in the same league as this beauty.  I'll buy it every time I see it.
This and Rare Breed rye have been my two favorite ryes that are actually available. Great review
Hunting for this now.  Tried it at Next Whiskey Bar a month ago and been searching ever since.
Couldn't agree more.
""Minty rye"" nails it. I love how it varies in ABV but that is one thing I always get.  The minty rye.  So bright and fresh to me and definitely one of my favorites as a dedicated rye fan.  And I just got another bottle of it at Trader Joe's of all places
Nice review. Think I‚Äôm going to open my bottle soon (tonight). Anything to slow down the Rare Breed Rye obsession is good-just love that hot spicy rye. Willett just started being avail in Ohio, but I‚Äôm able to find it pretty easily in NKy for under MSRP.
I see these all over in my area but are pushing 90$ so I keep walking because I never really was sure of how it was or what I should be paying. At 90$ I would really like to try the juice before I open my wallet.
One of my favorites that I can find fairly easily at around $60.
I‚Äôm with you. This and maybe a Four Roses store pick once a quarter and I‚Äôm a pig in shit
Site near me gets it in once a month or so. First time bought one bottle, realized how good it was and went back for 2 more the next time they had it
Yeah I have a three year that I have just been nursing! For waaaay to long because I have no idea when I‚Äôll find more
This is second to MWND for me
Sorry, it's been a long time since I've tried Pikesville I don't remember how it would compare to this. I think I like this one more though from what I remember. Pikesville never made a real strong impression on me.
This is heads and shoulders better than Pikesville. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of barely legal rye and actually prefer Rittenhouse over Pikesville because of value and I can‚Äôt tell them apart
pikesville runs hot to me. It‚Äôs not an unpleasant whiskey, but I seldom pick it up because Willet absolutely kicks its butt, and pikesville is by no means a bargain. Willet is just so flavorful
Still need to try that Rare Breede Rye, I've heard good things! I'm not usually big on Wild Turkey Rye but I'm still looking forward to trying that one soon
Where are you that rare breed rye is available? I haven‚Äôt seen it anywhere in DC (yet) and I don‚Äôt think has been a bottle in Virginia since January.
What is MWND?
No worries, thanks for the reply. Guess I have to try this now!
I‚Äôm admittedly a Wild Turkey fan in general. But the rare breed rye is really great.
It‚Äôs been on the shelf at my local total wine pretty consistently in KY
High west mid winters nights dram
I love Pikesville and this spanks Pikesville. Get a bottle if you find it for under $70
Awesome, thank you for this. This was what was holding me back. Definitely want to grab a bottle now. Thanks again.
Pikesville is probably my favorite Kentucky style ""barely legal"" ryes, but as a rye guy, willet 4yr is in a league of its own along with WP picks and Barrell Seagrass. Would definitely snag for 60-70 if you've never tried."

Brandy review #47

****************

**Copper & Kings Pear Brandy single barrel, Bevmo pick, 54.5%**

**Nose:** Unsurprisingly, nose is...pear! Tons of pear, it's bold and crisp and juicy. Like exactly how you imagine a juicy bartlett pear smelling, only moreso. I think there is some toffee wood and sweet vanilla in there, some mild wood spice. But it's all struggling to get past the huge juicy and sugary pear.

**Taste:**On the palate, like the nose, tons and tons of pear. It's like the biggest pear flavor you've ever had, more pear than an actual pear lol. Bold and juicy. It's a sugary bartlett pear, when it is so soft and ripe that your teeth just glide through it. Like the nose, the pear is so strong that I'm struggling to get much else. I think there's maybe a subtle caramel layer way in the back but maybe not. Mostly just big sharp juicy pear.

**Finish:** The sugary pear builds big and bold, a little more wood and toffee are there on the peak but it's subtle. Bold pear continues to take over, lingers and slowly fades. A long pear-y finish

**********

If you love pear and want a delicious pear-tasting spirit this is definitely for you. Saying this is spirit-forward is an understatement. Honestly, it may as well be a clear Eau De Vie Pear Brandy. Wood influence is minimal, or to put it more accurately the Pear flavor is so strong and upfront that nothing else can compete with it. Luckily though the pear flavor is excellent. But for my tastes, I wish there was more wood which is surprising given the dark natural color. I'm not a big fan of clear Brandy, to me it just tastes like the thing. This tastes like a really good pear but I already knew what a pear tastes like. For me, brandy doesn't get exciting until there's wood involved. And in that way it's disappointing. So it's kind of hard to score. It's excellent and well made for what it is, but not really my kind of thing. If you like fruit and pear Eau De Vie you will love this. I'll keep it for guests because I think it will really wow people.
Just came here to say pear brandy rocks!!
‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep it for guests.‚Äù  Good lord what must your liquor shelf look like."

Scotch review #246

*******************

**Kilchoman ""Machir Bay"" cask strength, 58.6% (done blind)**

**Nose:** Huge charred peat, powerful but so clean and sharp. Thick vanilla cream, light caramel, spice, sweet toasted oak, gritty barrel char. It's clean and sweet and the peat is just beautiful on it. Feeling sweet Bourbon barrel here

**Taste:** Big and peaty, no surprises here after the nose. Powerful blast of huge sweet peat and spice, sweet vanilla cream, light caramel and wood, bold bright fruitiness, gritty char, some malty and funky new make. It's a straightforward peat monster that is very well done. I'm still feeling sweet Bourbon barrel, leaning towards refill from how clean and bright it is

**Finish:** Barrel char and big sweet peat, delicious building spice, brightly sweet barrel notes. It's a huge and bright finish that pops with tons of heavy peat. Peat and sweet bright vanilla linger a long time 

* Definitely feeling Bourbon barrel peat here. The peat is so powerful and clean, and it feels bright and sweet so I'm leaning towards refill Bourbon barrel. Age is hard, the peat is strong enough that it could be young but I think it's all balanced enough that it probably has some decent 10ish years of age on it. I can't come up with a guess, but it's quality stuff. An excellent peat monster

Score **9**

*****************

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** wtf! This is unlike any Kilchoman I've ever had. I haven't been a huge fan of their other stuff I've tried. I've never had a Kilchoman that is such a straightforward peat monster like this one is. They always have some unique or quirky feel to them, they are just all over the place.

Damnit I remember when these were around and I passed it up. Kilchoman has always been such an easy pass for me because of the mixed results I've had with them plus the price

The post-reveal surprise is so fun! Just curious about what other Kilchoman expressions you've had and not been impressed by... I love the regular strength Machir Bay and have been eyeing the cask strength version. Sounds like I should pick up a bottle (or two)!
I so desperately want to try a CS Machir Bay. Thanks for the review and adding to my FOMO!
I don't remember a lot of them specifically, I've had good and bad from them going back 4 or 5 years. I'm actually wondering if maybe stuff was just too young that I tried and it will be better with more age. 

I do remember a young single cask Bourbon barrel release being one of the worst single malts I've ever had. Every pour of that bottle was me saying ""it can't be as bad as I remember, let me try it again"" and then ""yep it is as bad as I remember.""
Is the 2019 Meet the Peat version still available anywhere? It was only available in the Midwest US. I kept almost ordering one from Ace Spirits but never did and now it‚Äôs long gone. I grabbed the 2020 Festive Edition, but haven‚Äôt opened it yet. It‚Äôs gotten some good reviews, though. For more on Kilchoman, you should check out the cluster of reviews from [the Diving for Pearls blog. ](https://www.divingforpearlsblog.com/2021/02/five-week-kilchoman-cluster-begins.html?m=1)
Interesting. Maybe they're finding their feet.
I received that 2020 Machir Bay CS Holiday Edition a week ago.  I opened it for a quick sip before laying it away to finish some others.  It's a big one, as it has the strength of flavors to stand up to the alcohol level.  The other nice thing is that it has a good long finish, unlike reported for some of the other Machir Bay batches.  Glad I purchased it.
Wow, that's an interesting read, thanks. He sure came to a different conclusion than OP regarding the 2020 cask strength release.
Sounds great‚Äîthanks for sharing your impressions!
OP was writing about the 2019 Meet the Peat tour but yeah, I‚Äôm kind of shocked by how much he disliked many of the MB Cask Stregths because they are generally really well reviewed by just about everyone else.
Oops, my mistake, I see that now. Got confused because the 2020 CS is the one I can find locally.
I still picked that one up myself. Like I said, everyone else seemed to like it. I don‚Äôt put too much stock in a review based on a single dram anyway."

**Port Charlotte Micro-Provenance 2008 9 year, cask #3582 2nd fill Rivesaltes, 62.6% (done blind)**

**Nose:** Clean powerful peat, sweet caramel, funky strawberry and black cherry, milk chocolate, sweet vanilla, tropical fruitiness, bright lemon, sweet barrel char. A lot going on here, really delicious. Getting strong Port Charlotte vibes

**Taste:**  Caramel and thick peat, big blast of ashy char and peppery spice, calms down into milk chocolate, funky fruits, some zingy and hot dark cherry. Super complex, big peatiness but it's very lively with lots of other delicious flavors and spice competing

**Finish:**Caramel, big layer of warm tingly spice, black cherry, lots of sweet charred peat. Action packed til the end

* Great stuff. It immediately reminded me of Port Charlotte and I'm still feeling that. Hopefully it's not just a case of me making my mind up and then fitting the pieces where I think they should go. It's heavily peated but has a clean sharpness to it with lots of big vibrant flavors. Very lively and complex. All that along with the fruitiness and funk is reminding me of Port Charlotte. In any case I'm pretty sure it's another Islay

Score: **8**

**************

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** Nice! I often don't like to commit so hard to a guess out of fear of embarrasment haha, but I was really feeling PC on this. They just have such a distinct style. I wasn't even gonna try and guess barrel type, being Port Charlotte. You never know with Bruichladdich. But I should  have guessed Riveslates just for fun becasue of the funk. I have a theory that Rivesaltes is where a lot of the signature Laddie funk comes from. They use it a lot in their standard bottlings

**Lagavulin Distillery Exclusive, 54.1%(done blind)**

**Nose:** The last mystery sample was peated, and so is this one! We have thick Islay peat, menthol, vanilla, toasted marshmallow, sweet barrel char, clean caramel, wood spice, boggy peat. It noses like a Bourbon barrel Islay, awesome peaty goodness

**Taste:** Big and peaty, the peat hits a little softer than I was expecting. Heavy peat but it softly melds with thick sweet caramel, vanilla frosting, sweet toasted barrel notes, some boggy peat, vanilla char. There's a zingy little spice kick. The barrel notes hit big and delicious, the peat is huge but melds softly and doesn't take over. Delicious 

**Finish:** Thick soft peat, sweet toasted vanilla, some nice wood spice and ashy char. A peaty and sweetly toasted finish with sweet toasted vanilla and peat that lingers a long time

* I'm feeling Bourbon barrel Islay here, and it feels like a straightforward and delicious peat monster in the best possible way. Caol Ila fits that bill nicely, a stalwart peat monster. About 55% but the spice kick makes it feel like it might be a bit hotter in the upper 50's. There is nothing to not love here if you're a peat fiend like me. 

Score: **8**

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** What a zinger, nothing like I remember the 12 year being. I forgot to mention in my review but I was thinking a healthy 10-15 years. But there's no info given on the age/cask type for this unfortunately. There's a rumor on whiskyfun.com which I almost don't want to mention because there's no way to know if it's true, that it's 16 years old mostly bourbon barrel with a moscatel finish. I don't personally get any wine on this but it could certainly just be well integrated who knows. Excellent stuff whatever it is, not enough cask strength Laga out there

Scotch review #243

*********

**Bunnahabhain 2018 Feis Ile, 10 year Oloroso, 59.5% (done blind)**

**Nose:** Oh man, it's peaty and funky and tart. Fierce Islay peat, burnt and charred, burnt rubber, black licorice, sweet vanilla, chocolatey and oak, a strong dark berry tartness and lots of anise spice. Feels like an Islay with a strong tart wine influence

**Taste:** Darkly charred peat, tar, burnt rubber, peppery spice, once the dark funk calms down there's sweeter barrel notes of toasted oak and vanilla. Still lots of tart and sulfury wine, anise and spice. I don't think it's sherry, if it is then it's a powerful full term sherry. Reminds me more of some kind of strong red wine.

**Finish:** Strong peat and sweet vanilla, thick tart berry fruitiness, ashy charred peat, lingering smoke and black licorice and tartness. The flavors all come together really thick and delicious on the finish, I wish the initial blast of flavor was this good

* This is really interesting, but don't know if I'm a huge fan. The tart wine influence is a bit much and doesn't quite jive with all the burnt flavor. The big peat and barrel notes come through enough to save it but it's a wild bunch of flavors. It reminds me a little of the Laphroaig 2016 Cairdeas Madeira finish, but I like this one more than that monstrosity. Could also guess a Port Charlotte but it feels too peaty. I'm gonna say an unconventional-wine aged Laphroaig. Also, while I wasn't big on it at first I think it's growing on me as I drink it

*************

**Post-reveal thoughts:** Wow, that's a really cool one! Bunna wasn't even on my radar for guesses haha. I felt pretty strongly about it being some kind of unconventional red wine, can't believe it's oloroso. So tart and wine-y. Interestingly, I was told that someoene else who recieved this as a mystery also guessed a wine cask Laphroaig.

Not completely sure on price but I think it's about $60 for a liter

American Whiskey review #226

**************

**Wild Turkey 13 year ""Father and Son,"" 43%**

**Nose:** Woody caramel, leather, sweet vanilla, smooth tannic toasted oak, there's pronounced tobacco notes like cigar box and sweet pipe tobacco but it stays light and balnced. A hint of brighter cherry sweetness and mint. It's woody and old tasting but in a light easy way. Really nice

**Taste:** Drying oak, smooth toasted wood, some sweet flavored tobacco notes. Brightens as sweeter wood notes emerge like woody caramel, sweet vanillla, cherry, light chocolate. It's decieving, because at first it just hits you as this pleasant little sweet woody treat. But as the flavor unfolds you realize there's some complex wood notes in here. Great mouthfeel at only 43% too, won't blow you away or anything but it feels like a thick and viscous 40-45% in that old school kind of dusty way. 

**Finish:** Smooth sweet finish.  Sweet toasted oak, cherry, caramel, bright vanilla, descends into lightly tannic notes of pipe tobacco and sandalwood but stays sweet and oaky

*****************

At first glance it's just a simple little sweet and woody sipper, and then as you drink and dive in you realize there's some really interesting and complex wood notes going on. The light tobacco notes are particularly delicious to me. And it all balances together so well in that effortless way that Wild Turkey does extremely well. It achieves an impressive amount of flavor and complexity at only 43% with a really nice mouthfeel, but still keeps that smooth and easy drinking character of an old school low proof Bourbon at the same time. Great stuff

Very good notes on this one! While the proof is lower, I think this bottling remains in line profile wise with past travel exclusives (like the old Tradition). It definitely has some dusty notes and good complexity, I agree on the nice mouthfeel as well.
Fully agree.  This is a pretty wonderful bourbon at 43%, for my money the most dusty-profile new release WT has had in a long time.
Will this be available in most retail locations? Would love to buy a bottle for my father who‚Äôs a Turkey fan. Used to be his mothers Bourbon of choice.
Asking my dad in a few weeks to be my best man. He‚Äôs a big bourbon guy. I think this would be a great way to ask him. Any recommendations on how I can get a bottle??
Your notes align with mine very well on this one. I really enjoyed its complexity at lower proof. I think the key is it must be your first pour of the night.
Wow
No, I think this is only available as a travel exclusive in duty free airport shops and maybe some places like Japan
At least for now it seems to only be available in some shops in Japan or EU. It was intended for Duty Free shops, but with Covid they are showing up elsewhere.
Yeah, that helps with the low proof. Sometimes you're just in the mood for an easy sipper and something like this is nice
Bummer. Figured it‚Äôd be like that though.
Ahhh got it, good to know. Thanks!
Exactly! I told another user I wish it were readily available. Would be a perfect weekday pour after a rough day at work."

Scotch review #242

***************

**Imperial 1995 17 year, A.D. Rattray, Bourbon barrel, 52.2%**

**Nose:** Beautiful malty nose. Lots of rich honey, sugary pastry, cereal, some easygoing zippy spice and anise, crisp pear, vanilla, creamy malt, delicious tropical fruitiness. Complex and thick and silky smooth, fantastic nose

**Taste:** Syrupy and oily, honey, sugary vanilla icing, smooth cereal malt, delicious creaminess and buttery wood notes, warm tropical fruits, some light anise and char. It totally delivers on the excellent nose, has an oily and silky smooth mouthfeel. The flavor and feel is just right for a nice malty Scotch. I especially like the absence of strong floral notes you often find in stuff like this, it mostly feels very malty and fruity

**Finish:** A sweet and creamy smooth finish, thick honey, smooth cereal maltiness, some light tropical fruits, sweet and Scotchy. It just feels so right

This is a perfect example of when 'smooth' isn't a bad thing. It's smooth in a balanced and elegant way, but still has rich flavor with a really nice oily and creamy mouthfeel. It's not even what I would usually call a ""maltbomb,"" the malt and cereal notes are there but not loud or upfront. It balances well with a lot of sweet creamy and fruity notes. A beautiful pour. It's my very first Imperial and I'm quite impressed.

Great review, this sounds up my alley from your experience. I've only tried one Imperial but this warrants seeking more.
This sounds really good and makes you wonder why they mothballed this distillery? I remember a few years ago when Imperial was fairly available and reasonably priced - not so much any more. Very nice review.
Agreed. Binny's had a bunch of them maybe 3-4 years ago and around $100 or so. I didn't get around to getting any of those from Binny's but I did pick up a Signatory bottling, of a 1995 Imperial, 50.2% abv from Vine and Table in Caramel, IN. It was ( is) really good. In fact I went back and bought 2 more bottles. That's something I rarely do. They were around $90, I think? I finished the first one and have just opened up the 2nd with 1 still unopened. Bourbon cask aged and your review could have been written for it, IMHO. I took a chance because, well, FOMO and glad I did.
A year and a day since I opened the bottle, and just shy of 2 years since I bought it ($82 for 375ml) - which was also the last time I was on a commercial flight. I miss flying. Anyway, glad you enjoyed it.
Yeah makes me feel like maybe I missed out back when it was more available. I just never got around to trying it
It's a very floral (think cherry blossom tea) and subtly fragrant (think pomegranate) spirit with a massive hit of resin. Probably something that was not in vogue for a long time, especially as a single malt.

Something went right with the 1995 Imperials. The SV 46% NCF bottles are very good to great.
That's interesting. Well, I have a couple of the Signatory bottlings from 1995 ( abv 50.2% ) It's quite good. I'd love to try some of the other bottlings with those notes you described above. Maybe in a whisky bar someday as they've gotten pretty pricey.  Cheers.
I don't really give a shit about what your or others' anecdotal experience says. Empirical evidence of how taste works exists, I sum up the research literature there. Want to claim flavour difference? At least do it with reference to demonstrated mechanisms for it, not just irreversibly-tainted anecdotal experience.
Nice try with the anti-intellectualism you carried over from r/headphones and the stalking."
"Review #542: Doc Swinsons 15 year ""Exploratory Cask Series"" batch 009 Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, 56.9%",,https://i.redd.it/wg1ewwoqvp671.jpg,"Mystery Bourbon sourced from somewhere in Kentucky, bottled at an impressive 15 years of age and at barrel proof. There's different theories of where this might be sourced from, but from what I understand it's impossible to really know for sure. For more info u/Prepreludesh did an excellent writeup on these and other similar bottlings [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/l0ngzh/the_mystery_of_the_785_13_85_kentucky_straight/). The tl;dr is that it's a custom mashbill not to be found at any of the big distilleries(78.5% corn/13% rye/8.5% barley), and it is all being sold & bottled from big storage containers instead of the original oak barrels, so there's really nothing to go on. 

Also as a sidenote, this sample I tried was from a ""Nasa Liquor pick,"" but K&L Wine also had an ""exclusive pick"" with the same batch number and identical specs. This batch was about 4,000 barrels and I don't think either store got that many, so stores seem to be putting their own labels and names on these large and widely available batches. Just an fyi

These were going for about $150, not sure if they are still available anywhere

American Whiskey review #225

****************

**Doc Swinsons 15 year Kentucky Straigh Bourbon Whiskey, ""exploratory cask series"" batch 009, 56.9%**

**Nose:** Rich nutty brown sugar and toffee, sweet cherry cola, vanilla, clean toasted oak, toasted marshmallow, a strong yet mellow layer of warm menthol spice. Sweet and oaky in an approachable way, it's so incredibly balanced. Delicious nose

**Taste:** More oak comes out on the palate, but it still keeps a lot of that bright happy sweetness. Tannic oak, tobacco, sweet brash corn, bright cherry cola, creamy nutty caramel, herbal and minty spice, brown sugar, sweet toasted oak. Has some notes that can be a bit harsh in younger Bourbons but they come together really nice and it's balanced by some nice creaminess and sweetness. Like the nose it's big but incredibly balanced

**Finish:** Big bright finish of Cherry cola and corn, sweet spice blast, toasted oak. Some spice and dry tannic oak lingers. A bright blast of a finish, very fun

*************

This is really nice stuff. I love how bright it is along with the nice nutty and creamy sweetness. The oak is definitely still there but it hasn't taken over at all. It just feels very balanced and drinkable overall, the classic Bourbon flavors are all there but nothing takes over too strongly. Just for fun I poured some Stagg to compare, the only other super old Bourbon I have. It is much bigger all around: thicker, denser, hotter. This Doc Swinson can't quite compete on it's level, but it's nice in it's own way by taking more bright and brash flavors and leveling them out with age. Didn't know what to expect from this but I'm a fan!

Yes yes, but did you mix it with Coke, or Pepsi?
I have a batch 11 unopened and I am very, very excited. Thank you for the review!
I have the same batch and have been nursing it for a while now. I find it, like you, highly enjoyable. Excellent review. My liquor store guy says it is sourced from Heaven Hill, but who knows?
Great review. I honestly really love this stuff and keep a couple bottles on hand.
Thanks for the review!

I can still get this batch for $155.  Have you had Bardstown Discovery Series 4?  If so, how does this compare?  That stuff is right up my alley.
Nice review. I have a sample of this tucked away that I need to try. I also stumbled upon a new 15 year bottle from a brand I‚Äôve never heard of at my local TW. Assumption is it‚Äôs the same juice.
So in your opinion, did it taste like Beam? üòâ

And excellent research on NASA and K&L having identical batch and proof specs!
Diet Dr Pepper is the only way to go
Hopefully not either, but especially not Coke.
Sorry, I haven't had that Bardstown. That price is about right for this stuff, it's a tough call for me though. I don't think I would do it, mainly because I drink a lot of Scotch and other spirits and I feel like that much money could probably be a little better spent elsewhere. But if you're mainly a Bourbon drinker the quality is there and I don't think you'll be disappointed
I don't think I feel confident enough in the flavor to wager any kind of guess on the origins, sorry. 

I got lucky on that observation about store picks. I got this sample + a bottle picture of the Nasa pick and I had a bottle of the K&L pick when I got it for a friend, so I was able to compare
A Doctor & Doctor, then?
Thanks again. I've been passing on this for a long time and don't think I'll be in any rush to purchase."

Scotch review #241

*************

**Octomore 2008 6 year ""Rest & Be Thankful,"" ex-Bourbon cask #B000005708, 66.3%**

**Nose:** Thick creamy peat, rich toasted oak, caramel, fudgy chocolate, strong menthol spice, sweet vanilla, brine, sweet peaty char. Strong oak notes meld with the huge Octo peat, it's a thick oaky monster of an Octo with insane peat

**Taste:** Arrives with an explosion of flavor, it's huge. Big blast of intense Octo peat, peppery spice, burnt rubber, big brash toasted wood, vanilla, toffee, wood spice. It's a bit brash almost in a Bourbon kind of way, it's a flavorful brashness of spice and oak and tons of peat. Delivers on signature Octo notes but has a kick for sure. A great lively Octo

**Finish:** Huge finish of oaky vanilla and caramel, huge peat, chocolate, big blast of peppery spice, slowly fades into sweet vanilla and creamy thick peat with lingering spice.

***********

This is a really cool one. It takes on a lot of character from the Bourbon barrel, it has a lot of Bourbon-y spice and brashness along with rich toasted oak notes that works really well with the thick Octo peat. Beautiful stuff. Like the previous casks, it's Octo on Steroids. Instead of that thickly soft and layered texture that standard releases have it's extremely bold and punchy, all the flavors seem more intense. That could be good or bad depending on your tastes. As a big Octomore fan I fucking love it, and on top of that it's just really interesting to experience that raw and bold Octomore flavor before it is skillfully blended and balanced. These have been great and a whole lot of fun. 

In summary, the first two casks were the standouts. Both were some of the best Octomore and best Scotch I've ever had. The French oak was my favorite, and the 6 year Sauternes was right alongside it in quality and more of a wine bomb of an Octomore. The 7 year Sauternes was my least favorite, it's a bit hot and closed but still a solid peat monster. This Bourbon barrel is excellent too but can't quite compete with the winners for my tastes. I would still be thrilled to own a bottle though

*****************

**Octomore 2007 7 year ""Rest & Be Thankful,"" Sauternes Cask #2007003810, 63.9%**

**Nose:** Big Octomore peat, thick and creamy, vanilla, malty caramel, creamy toffee, cake frosting, menthol spice, some smooth strawberry and wine funk. The peat and sweet creamy notes are the main attraction, the wine doesn't smack you in the face right away

**Taste:** Thick peat and menthol, hot HOT cherry and spice, creamy caramel, sweet vanilla icing, mild strawberry wine funk, thick charred peat. Plenty of thick Octo peat but the rest of the flavor doesn't quite come together, and it drinks too hot. A little water mellows out the flavor and brings out a more oily mouthfeel, but doesn't drastically improve it

**Finish:** Lots of brash peppery spice, creamy vanilla and peat, some peaty barrel char. Long finish but it stays pretty hot and overwhelms the flavor a bit

***********

Delicious, but nowhere near as spectacular as the first two. The nose is very promising with a thick peaty creaminess and a more subtle wine influence than the previous Sauternes cask. On the palate it basically holds onto that character, but the flavor is a bit too closed and with a lot of heat. It's still delicious with plenty of signature thick Octo peat, but for the price I'm entitled to nitpick. I was thinking water might help so I added a little at the end, it's interesting but doesn't drastically improve it. Sauternes cask #R0000016751 was much better.

*******************

**Octomore 2007 6 year ""Rest & Be Thankful,"" Sauternes Cask #R0000016751, 64.5%**

**Nose:** Big Octomore peat with lots of wine sweetness. Thick peat, vanilla, heavy brine and peppery spice, sweet malty caramel, fruity berries, wine funk, lemon citrus, brightly floral. Some menthol and char on the back end. The thick peat is always there with bright sweet wine notes and spice up front.

**Taste:** Big briny Octomore peat explodes on the palate with a blast of peppery spice, malty caramel, a lot of bright fruits and floral notes, lemon citrus, tart berries, sweet funky wine, but then the sweetness is contrasted beautifully by vanilla and dark ashy barrel char. And that thick Octo peat throughout. The flavor all hits so intensely

**Finish:** Thick peat and bright peppery spice, tart berries, sharp clean caramel. Sweet and fruity but plenty of spice heat and Octo peat, the fnish is impossibly long

*************************

You are signing up for the wine finished Octomore experience with this, and it does not disappoint. The wine and fruits are bright and in your face, but they can't outcompete that intense briny Octomore peat so it never overwhelms. This is suprisingly malty too. I'm blown away by the complexity for how huge the flavors are, it's all over the place but in a good way. In fact standard Octomore bottles feel a little soft and layered compared to these R&BT single casks so far. These drink bolder with much more intense flavors, yet at the same time it feels more nimble on the palate. It definitely drinks hot at 64.5%, hotter than a standard Octo would at a similar abv. It's incredible stuff though

Great review. A Sauternes Cask is pretty typical of Bruichladdich. Would be interesting to see what the bottle would be like after a bit of Oxygen in it. Was this your own bottle?
I've got a bottle of this one and it's wonderful, I'll have to formally review it on here at some point
A very unusual bottling for Bruichladdich. I can't seem to find one in my area, but I'd love to give it a go.
So much on finedrams that I want. Just wish I wasn't too cheap to pay for shipping.
Great review BTW. I'm an aspiring octomore fan. I've only had a few drams and own only 1 myself. Now I'll be jonesing for this bottle as well
It's available on FineDrams.com in Europe, they ship to the U.S.
Thanks! No it's not my bottle. I got to try it freshly opened from a friend
It's not actually bottled by bruichladdich. Rest & Be Thankful is an independent bottler that got hold of these octomore barrels and released them themselves. But yeah it's pretty unusual to see octomore single barrels
Given that there are only 302 bottles of this in the world, I'm not surprised you can't find it at your local stores
You won‚Äôt find cheaper shipping to the states anywhere.
[removed]
Yeah, I know. Just need to buckle down and drop a few hundred so it makes shipping worth it. That means I need to cut back on something else, like cigars, and I detest that idea.

***********

**Octomore 2008 7 year ""Rest & Be Thankful,"" French oak cask ##200800908, 63.9%**

**Nose:** No mistaking the nose, this is a beast of an Octomore through and through. HUGE meaty peat, It's powerful and phenolic, sharp intense brine, thick vanilla icing, rich furniture woodiness, chocolatey toasted oak, menthol, peaty char, tannic oak and cacao. So much delicious complex oak notes and epicly peaty

**Taste:** Huge peat, it's sharp and intense, big toasted wood, blast of sweet hot spice, caramel oakiness, chocolatey toasted oak, waves of intense peat that just keep coming. Sweet vanilla and menthol char. A lot of complex oak on this but it keeps it intensely peaty Octomore character. All the flavors are huge and intense but it's glued together by that insanely thick octomore peatiness. Amazing stuff

**Finish:** That wave of thick octo peat just stays with you and coats your mouth right into the finish with fudgy chocolate, woody caramel, toasted oak, sweet vanilla char. It's a thick sludgy finish with impossibly huge peaty flavor

******************

This is incredible. I was wondering how much of that familiar thick Octo character might come from strategic blending, but this single cask is fiercely Octomore. So recognizable right away. There's just nothing else out there like it. If anything this is more Octomore than Octomore. All the flavors seem to hit bigger and more intense, but at the same time it's so nimble and complex. That peat is just insane. This one has some very active wood going on and it drinks hot but it's beautifully executed with the big octo peat. One of the best Octomores and best Scotches I've ever had.

I look at this bottle just about every day on FineDrams. Glad somebody on here has finally been able to try it and review it. 

Definitely wish I could get get my hands on one of these. 

Great review! Look forward to seeing the rest of the series!
I really enjoyed my sample of this one, too. I remember the finish being so good it made you forget about the already great nose and taste. The prices are tough to get past, but every Octomore from this bottler I see it's always such a struggle to pass up.
Stunning bottle that's a keeper
Stop this series right now! I'll probably have to get a bottle of Octomore after it.. Great review, this sounds really tasty!
Octomore hype!  Glad you liked it.  These R&BT ones are so good and the price so painful.  I don't usually feel like expensive bottles are worth it-- but these have all been good enough I wouldn't feel bad about having a whole bottle.
Great review despite the lack of filthy minkeys.

That u/b1uepenguin is a rotten FOMO inducing SOB.
Oh God, that sounds like a wonderful dram! Thank you for the review.
WOW, this sounds amazing. Thanks for sharing!
Thanks! I hope you find it useful, but also I hope you won't hold it against me if you end up wanting one
Exactly this. Octomore has always been ""painful but worth it"" on the price, then these have to come along and sink the dagger even deeper.
Ha, sorry for the lack of minkey. I started thinking a while back that a picture of the bottle being reviewed might be more helpful than my neat poster. It still gets to appear when I review a bottle of my own
100% did. Just need to drop the dough and start diving into Octomore in general
It's good.  I've thought about that with samples too.

**Nose:** Brown sugar, caramel, sweet orange, big delicious nuttiness, graham cracker, sweet toasted wood and char, complex minty and herbal spice. Minty and nutty with lots of brown sugar, beautiful sweet nose

**Taste:** It's hot but in a big bold way, tons of flavor. Big mint and spice, bright sweet toasted wood, hot minty cherry, brown sugar and caramel, nutty graham cracker, musty wood, lots of delicious oak spice. It has a really well balanced feel for how big and hot it is. It's spicy but doesn't feel brash or burning. Just a really flavorful spice. Great stuff

**Finish:** Flavor keeps coming and building huge on the finish. Bright syrupy caramel and wood, sweet corn, big minty spice, it builds and rides out for a really long time sweet and minty and spice-y. What a fantastic finish

***********

I was never a big fan of Bookers so my experience is limited, but this stuff is fantastic. Easily the best Bookers I've ever had. Big and bold and complex, and the flavors stay balanced despite all the spice and heat. Flavors and mouthfeel all come together really well.

Just curious, do you have an idea of how long these glass bottles keep a sample? Was it recently poured into the bottle, or has it been sitting in there for a few years?
Glad you enjoyed this. It is a really good batch. I have only about two pours left of the bottle and just poured one now:)
This was just recently poured into the sample bottle by a friend. He actually just opened his bottle and this was the very first pour interestingly enough. 

As far as how long it will last in the 2oz sample bottle, it shouldn't be any different than the original bottle or any other sealed glass container. If anything it might be a little safer, since corks can rot or dry out while these use a plastic seal.
That makes sense. I have the same ones and they seem to seal fairly well. I mainly use mine to store a pour from a favorite bottle, but I haven't been doing it very long so I don't know if they're suitable for long term storage. I figure it'll be better keeping a pour in these than keeping it in a nearly empty original bottle because you have less headspace evaporation loss."

Scotch review #237

*************

**Bruichladdich 1991 25 year, Cadenhead's 175th anniversary, single 1st fill Bourbon cask, 54%**

**Nose:** Thick hay malt, honey, coastal brine, big clean caramel, sugary frosting, some brighter lemon citrus and floral sweetness, vanilla, baking spice. It all unfolds gently and naturally, beautiful malty nose

**Taste:** Elegant flavor, clean and effortless. Honey, light syrupy caramel, sugary frosting, clean hay maltiness, lightly sweet vanilla, gentle floral notes, understated brine. It has that oily mouthfeel and easygoing complexity that comes with age. It's delicate but very rewarding, you really need to take your time with it

**Finish:** A light pop of bright sweet sugary frosting and lemon citrus, slowly oozes into warm baking spices, sweet malt and light sugary caramel. It leaves a very lightly sweet and ""happy"" feel on the tongue

******************

Excellent example of a well aged Scotch. It's on the more delicate and sweet side, but all the flavor just falls into place perfectly with a nice oily mouthfeel. It has that quality of effortless complexity I often associate with age where all the flavors flow so smoothly. Really nice stuff, it could maybe be a little thicker and less delicate for my tastes but all in all it's exactly the kind of thing I would look for in a well-aged Bourbon barrel Scotch.

Just curious to see what your definition. Of hay malt is? Like more farmhouse?
Great review.  

I was lucky to find a similar small batch at 22 years of age that has some wonderful complexity and brings a real challenge to Black Art.  Sadly there aren't many of these older Bruichladdich any longer.  But they can be such good whisky.
Great review and glad you liked it. It is so good. As one mention, ‚Äúhay malt‚Äù?
I tried this stuff from a friend, but I believe the bottle originally went for about $250
I guess I meant more of a grassy malt, but it just reminded me of hay more. Like more rustic maybe? I don't know it felt right at the time haha
Thanks dude! I explained it to someone else, I think it was kind of like grassy malt but ""hay"" just felt right at the time for whatever reason. Sorry if that doesn't help much haha"

American Whiskey review #223

**************

**Colonel E.H. Taylor Barrel Proof, 63.75%**

**Nose:** Big creamy and buttery nose with a Bourbony edge. Creme brulee, big sweet corn, lots of powerful complex spice, musty wood, thick orange caramel, cherry, minty barrel char. Wow this nose promises so much more than just your average big spicy hot Bourbon. A dense and complex creamy nose that hits powerful but measured

**Taste:** Aaaaand the flavor delivers on what the nose promised. Huge sweet Bourbony corn, thick creamy caramel and creme brulee, sweet toasted wood, bright caramel, vanilla, big spice that is thick and complex and delicious. Everything about this is huge, the flavor just keeps building but it feels very refined and ""finished"" at the same time. Has a delicious creamy quality to it along with all the big spicy Bourbon flavors 

**Finish:** Bright orange caramel and brown sugar, thick minty spice heat and corn, sweet toasted wood. The delicious Bourbon spice and bright sweet caramel lingers a long time. Killer finish that hits with a bright sweet bang and rides out a long time

*****************

I've only ever tried this stuff once before now, and it as a long time ago. I'm blown away at how good this is. Truly a barrel proof monster but at the same time it has a refined quality compared to more hot and untamed stuff like Stagg jr or 60%+ Four Roses Private Selects. And the thick creamy flavors it has are amazing, unlike any other big barrel proofer I've had. This is an epic pour. Now I'm just wondering if this is an especially good batch or if they are consistently this good.

For a fun extra I poured a little Stagg jr Batch 8 to go alongside this. The Stagg jr feels much hotter and brasher than this. The Taylor hits every bit as hard but it's thicker and more flavorful, it has much more interesting flavors to compliment the big Bourbony punch. I love Stagg jr don't get me wrong but I feel like the Taylor Barrel Proof is clearly it's superior.

Ugh if I could only find a bottle, seems like all that is near me are mainly small batch with the occasional single barrel
As my flair says, it's my all-time fav. I snagged a bunch of these years ago before they became completely impossible to find and have been slowly drinking through them ever since.
passed on EHT BP  at $300 this year... assuming this stuff is probably 8-10 years old, the SiB picks are up to 9 years old?

Shame nearly all BP products of BT are near impossible to get because honestly their distillate is crazy good at BP.
Is it true that E.H. Taylor is one of those brands that is being counterfeited?
Great review. This is an all time favorite for me, and probably one of the best, if not the best I‚Äôve ever tried.     I appreciate that you didn‚Äôt do the whole ‚Äúthis stuff is overrated‚Äù slant that seems to accompany most BT product reviews on this sub; it‚Äôs simply great whiskey, period, point blank!  Now with all that said, I wouldn‚Äôt even dream of finding a bottle of this in the wild; but if you go to a good bourbon/ whiskey bar, the BT distillery, or somewhere that happens to have this, and you can get a pour or two, I‚Äôd never pass it up.
I lucked into two bottles of the BP in a raffle. It‚Äôs the one I go for when I want a drink for a special occasion, pretty tasty stuff.
Seems like maybe BT figured out their barrel proofers. Stagg Jr and EHTBP have both gotten pretty consistently high praise over time. I‚Äôd challenge OP to do this one head-to-head with batch 12 or 13, if not the current 15!
This is one of those bottles that I can never seem to find, even for more than retail. I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than retail but man, I‚Äôd love to try this...and I will eventually.
This is on my bottle bucket list
I‚Äôm happy to just get small batch. Never even seen one of these.
Great review of the 2016 batch.  I thought the 2018 and 2019 batches of ehtbp were outstanding.  Was very disappointed with the 2020 batch.  Tasted like small batch with ethanol added to it.  Hopefully 2021 is better.
Would love to even find one of these
This and Small Batch are the only two Taylors worth it to me (at MSRP, of course...or even a little above for these two). Thanks for the review!
i was lucky enough to find a bottle for $89 earlier this year and it's incredible. i'm always on the search for a second
Seen one where I‚Äôm at for $699. Never seen one for $100.
Awesome review.  i was fortunate to purchase one for retail (\~$90) in the greater Chicagoland area.  This bottle as well as small batch, single barrel, and the rye never make it onto shelves otherwise ""the hunters"" come out of the wood work.  I am debating if i give it a taste this weekend or wait for the holidays to share with my family.
Excellent review, it's been a loooong time since I finished this particular bottle too & recent prices have made me consistently pass up another bottle just because of how stupid the pricing is (especially here in WA state).
Dude I would be thrilled to stumble across a small batch alone.
Same here in north Georgia. Hoping to find 2.
Smart man. I‚Äôm still looking for one. Hoping I can find one or trade one of these days
$300 is a real pain point on this bottle - I would probably pick it up at that amount but feel like a dickhead for it. Snagged a bottle for $150 last year, which I felt totally fine paying
Yea it was on 60 minutes I believe. A big time store in NYC was caught selling a counterfeit four grain. They sent it to BT to be analyzed and it was completely off ABV and mash bill
Thanks! 

> I appreciate that you didn‚Äôt do the whole ‚Äúthis stuff is overrated‚Äù slant that seems to accompany most BT product reviews on this sub

I will say that there's stuff like Weller or Blanton's where it is a bit silly to be hunting and buying at crazy secondary prices. But then there's stuff like this or Stagg where the hype is unfortunate, but it at least makes more sense because it is phenomenal
I'd love to, side by sides like that are a lot of fun! I haven't tried many newer batched of Stagg jr actually, so I'd love to see how far it's come along. I probably should have mentioned that fact when I compared the two bottles in my review
Here in SoCal there are quite a few from $50-$100
$150 is a steal tbh... felt 300 was too much, 229/249 would be my upper maximum.

But they sold at $300 so ü§∑
I thought that I heard something about that, thanks.
Here in NOLA they‚Äôre few and far between. I‚Äôd snap one up for $50 in a heartbeat.
In that price range you must be mistaken for the small batch.
Whereabouts in Socal?  Looking at the ones closer to $50, please.
local store sold 2 at 499 each here
I asked everyone around me (Denver, CO) and they are making people join raffles to get a bottle.
That‚Äôs the price point I bought a couple of bottles for. Interestingly enough I like it a lot but never gravitate towards it.
I was referring to small batch
Not sure at the moment, they pop up sporadically
I love bourbon but that's just a crazy price.
It ain‚Äôt that good.
If you ever visit Vegas I‚Äôll happily hook you up with a bottle or two!
I'll hold you to that man, I'm actually planning a trip there later this year! Haha

I actually made a post on here asking for suggestions for a good substitute for the EH Taylor I couldn't find in town.
Where in Vegas?
You seriously can. Just shoot me a PM whenever."

American Whiskey review #222

**************

**Wild Turkey 12 year 101, 50.5%**

**Nose:** Decadent maple soaked wood, lots of vanilla, fudgy chocolate, smooth corn sweetness, tart berry fruitiness, smooth toasted wood. It all melds into a smooth and thick treat

**Taste:** A bit more dry than the sweet nose. Big toasted oak, woody caramel, cacao, vanilla, mild cherry fruitiness, some nice clean corn sweetness emerges on the end. It's on the more ""smooth and drinkable"" side. But the whole thing feels very measured and controlled, incredibly balanced with delicious flavor.

**Finish:** vanilla and corn sweetness builds brighter with some balanced spice, leaves sweet and oaky smooth.

**********************

Delicious flavor that all works very harmoniously. It's maybe a little too light, which is surprising at the 50.5% abv. But as an old school smooth and easy sipping style of Bourbon it's just about perfect. All the flavor falls into place perfectly even if I wish there was a little more of it. I would gladly keep a bottle of this around if they still made stuff like this (fuckers).

When?
Here‚Äôs to hoping ü•É
Not sure. I think it should be released already, just trickling into stores. I know I‚Äôm keeping an eye out. I love the RR SiB‚Äôs and Wild Turkey pretty much anything.
Already released in Colorado apparently. Saw a few go on secondary for way more than I would pay

American Whiskey review #221

******************

**Smooth Ambler Old Scout Bourbon(MGP) single barrel #27810, r/Bourbon pick, 6 year 59.5%**

**Nose:** Friendly blast of herbal spice and nose numbing menthol, bold sweet funky corn, fun and fruity, rich nutty caramel, clean toasted wood. Feels lively and sweet and fun with a beautiful caramel richness to balance it all

**Taste:** Big bright blast of sweet corn and spice, cherry fruitiness, herbal and lively, but also lots of rich sweet caramel, sweet toasted wood. The spice and brashness is just enough to be fun and lively but it stays friendly, and it's balanced well by all the fruity sweetness and caramel. It's remarkably well rounded. Drinks ridiculously well at the abv too 

**Finish:** Sweet woody caramel and bright spice, corn and menthol. Long flavorful finish that is bright and happy, it just pops and is so satisfying. Lingering herbal spice and tons of Bourbony sweetness

*************

This is a firecracker of a Bourbon. It's lively and bright in a drinkable way, and so much delicious Bourbon sweetness. Just enough rich caramel and sweet oak to where it doesn't feel *too* spirity. It never feels too hot or out of control at all, not even a little, an impressive feat considering the young age and high abv. This is what a barrel selection is all about, finding gems like this one that are just plain drinkable and tasty. Well done on this one u/t8ke and any others involved!

Oh damn dude I knew that already, I watched the video with you guys picking it haha. Slipped my mind, there's been so many of these picks lately. That was a great video, you were great and knowledgeable which is nothing new but also fun to watch which I did not know. Yeah great job and thanks for the great sipper

If I remember correctly you liked the other barrel, but you weren't going to pick it and got outvoted right? You still liked it though? I'm really curious about that one now too, I have it but haven't opened it yet
Dontcha hate that? With a 4R pick, you get to a sheet of all the barrel numbers that were available that day. That helped me track down the barrel that I loved the most the day I helped do a pick (which was an OBSK).  But we may never know who got that other SAOS pick!"

American Whiskey reviews #219/220

*********************************

**(A) Rebel Yell 10 year single barrel #5083206, 50%**

**Nose:** Creamy caramel, brash peppery spice, menthol heat, musty stale wood, brash hot metallic cherry. A bit unpleasant of a nose

**Taste:** Creamy caramel, thin brash wood, hot bitter spice kick, hot metallic cherry, caramel and corn sweetness. Some good flavor but it's thin and stale with a heavy dose of spice and the wood notes are off. Throws it all off a little

**Finish:** thin caramel and wood, some cherry sweetness and corn

********************************

**(B) Rebel Yell 10 year single barrel #4744369 (sample), 50%**

**Nose:** Creamy caramel, slightly burnt and nutty, toasted wood, vanilla, musty, candy cherry, mellow spice. It's light but it's a nice sweet wheater nose

**Taste:** Smooth easy drinking. Warm caramel, sweet cherry, mellow toasted wood, vanilla, some zingy corn sweetness, a nutty creaminess that is nice but a little washed out unfortunately, mellow spice flavor

**Finish:** Caramel and thin sweet toasted wood, some sweet cherry toffee, vanilla

**********************************

Interesting set of barrels to pair together. There's some common themes but they each have unique qualities that make them drink quite differently. B is the clear winner here, no question. They both have a creamy caramel quality and cherry sweetness with rather thin wood. 

A is much more spicy and brash with an off-putting stale musty quality, and the wood notes are a little ""off."" B is super mellow and smooth, maybe too smooth. But good in an easy drinking kind of way. It has a creamy nuttiness that is nice and the sweetness clicks better. They both feel a little thin and unspectacular, but B isn't bad for the $50 price or whatever they go for now.

I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of heaven hill wheated bourbons which these were rumored to be but I bought a couple a few years ago for $60 and I think they represent pretty solid value at that price. 10+ years, solid proof, wheater not easy to find these days for that much. But yeah didn‚Äôt wow me.
‚ÄúMore, more, more!‚Äù

Can't beat the WHEAT
I would agree with you on B in my review here, a solid little WHEATER even if it's nothing too special. But unfortunately the bottle I have (A in my review) is kinda bad"

Brandy review #46

*************

**Grosperrin 1988 Fins Bois Cognac ""Lot 235,"" 47%**

**Nose:** Butterscotch, sugary caramel, cinnamon wood spice, floral and sweet, clean elegant wood, mellow refined grape fruitiness, a slightly musty fruitiness, sugary cream. Very elegant and refined, quite sweet but not overly so

**Taste:** Caramel, sweet buttercream, flavorful but smooth and elegant, floral pop of sweetness, the fruits are subtle and dry, clean lightly toasted wood, mellow spice tingle, some mildly bitter grape. It feels like most of the sweetness comes from a sugary and buttery wood flavor, it's very reserved on the fruits

**Finish:** Mildly bitter rancio notes emerge more on the finish that make this a little more interesting and complex, still plenty of light caramel, floral wood spice and grape skin, sweet lightly toasted wood

***********

This is my quintessential idea of a Cognac. Elegant and refined with light balanced flavors that flow smoothly and don't smack you in the face. Floral. Has an effortlessly smooth complex feel and it's fun to let it unfold in your mouth and pick apart. I tend to prefer the bolder flavors of Armagnac but this is hitting the spot tonight, I could see the gentler more subtle flavor being good for the right mood. Really well done for this style that I'm not usually big on(maybe it's growing on me!).

**Taste:** Fruity and spicy, butterscotch and light Rye spice kick, sweet caramel grape, clean minty Rye, some light hot cherry. It's tasty, but maybe a little light compared to the amazing nose. Really solid Rye flavor though with an extra touch of fruitiness I think

**Finish:** Minty Rye and spice, hot cherry, a light balanced fruitiness, light caramel. Sweet and easygoing Rye, tasty and drinkable

*******

Really good stuff. I think I can pick up the Cognac finish here, it seems a little extra fruity to me in a balanced and well integrated way. I swear I even get a little grape fruitiness but maybe it's just my head playing tricks. The butterscotch notes are particularly delicious, especially on the fantastic nose. An all around tasty Rye, it's maybe just a little too light but it stays very drinkable. Great for the 50ish dollars these usually go for

Scotch review #236

*****************

**Balmenach 2008 11 year, Blackadder Raw Cask, sherry finish 58.5%**

**Nose:** Beautiful nose. Caramel malt, thick toffee and graham cracker, nutty almost, orange slice, strawberry candy sweetness, tart grape, vanilla, toffee char, nutty spice. Delicious and super inviting.

**Taste:** Nice toffee and toasted wood, smooth rich malt, graham cracker and hearty pastry/bread notes, hot wood spice, a wholesome nuttiness. A balanced fruit sweetness slowly emerges of candy cherry and strawberry with some tart grape, but it stays light and subtle. Builds to some green apple, mild spice and sweet char. So complex and tasty.

**Finish:** Toasted barrel and toffee with sweet char notes, green apple, warm easy fruits, grassy malt. Delicious and easygoing yet thick bodied all the way to the finish. Has a lingering sweet nuttiness and malt

************

This is so tasty and drinkable. There's a really interesting kind of nutty toffee/graham cracker thing that works really well with the maltiness and sweet candied fruit. And it's one of those nice sherry finishes that has a sweet influence but stays subtle, I love that about it. Complex and inviting and the flavors stay very well-balanced. Great stuff

Hey, great review. This was a tough one. I see we had a lot of similar notes but I am going to have to go back and see just what I thought was ""glazed raw steak"" or ""cooked tomatoes"". I might have been hungry when I reviewed this one. Sweet and savory, great depth. Really fun stuff.  It's interesting to read different reviews of the same whisky. Cheers!
Balmenach is underrated IMO.
>I might have been hungry when I reviewed this one

Lol, this cracked me up. Yeah it's always fun to see other points of view on the same stuff

Hah, well...Tasting notes are so varied. They are impacted and influenced by so many factors. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs so cool about scotch, one   can  pick  up different notes / tastes and memories each time. The bottom line is you know a good one from a not so good. Yeah, well, back to work."

World Whisky review #23

*************

**Connemara Peated Irish Whiskey, Cask Strength Bourbon barrel 57.9%**

**Nose:** Intense dirty peat, lots of burnt rubber, heavy smoke, citrus, brine, mean barrel char, vanilla frosting, washed out caramel, peppery spice heat, black licorice and spirity funk. That charred peat is a profile I usually love, but I think it's maybe too burnt and charred and hot. Feels unbalanced

**Taste:** Yeah, it's hot and lively. Big intense peat, charred and dirty, big peppery spice blast of heat, bright citrus, funky wood, an overload of anise and black licorice kind of of burnt peaty spice. Like the nose there's a nice peaty experience at the core, but it all hits too burnt and hot and unbalanced. Healthy amount of spirity funk too, it might be a tad too young

**Finish:** vanilla and charred peat, funky stale wood, peaty toasted bourbon barrel notes. Leaves spicy and peaty

*******************

I was a big fan of the standard Connemara 10 peated bottle, it was impressive for only being 40%. But I don't like this as much as I had hoped. Plenty of intense peat, but it hits kind of unbalanced and hot with some unpleasant funky notes. The burnt rubber and black licorice is too strong and there's a kind of funky stale wood thing going on. It's not terrible, still plenty of nice peatiness to enjoy. I think it's just too young maybe based on some of the spirity funk I'm getting. I was just expecting more based on the quality of the 10 year.

EDIT: I don't normally add water, but I tried it here and it really helped. Calms down the heat and funk, balances it out really nicely. More honey sweetness emerges, the peat is thick but softer and more tasty, starts to resemble a good peated highland malt.

I'd love to try the 12 year old. Probably the oldest peated Irish expression in existence.
I can totally see that. It just doesn't quite click and come together very well. Goes to show that a good peat monster isn't as simple as just making something super peaty. And yeah, try some water it made a world of difference"

Brandy review #45

******

**Tertre 1998 20 year Calvados single barrel, 58.5%**

**Nose:** Plenty of big bold apple, caramel, toffee wood, sweet anise char and vanilla, smooth chocolatey toasted wood, lots of sweet sugary fruitiness. At first wood isn't as heavy as I thought it might be at the age, but it kinda sneaks up on you. Still a straightforward bold Calvados nose but with smooth balanced and sweet wood notes. Beautiful

**Taste:** Smooth bold apple, velvety soft caramel and toffee woodiness, light sweet vanilla, smooth and well-balanced toasted wood, chocolate, some mild anise and mellow spice. The toffee and toasted wood is soft and well integrated, still has lots of bold apple-y calvados flavor. Thick and bold yet such a smooth and mellow pleasure, just wow 

**Finish:** Big finish of bright fruity juicy apple and anise spice, minty black liquorice, caramel, sweet vanilla and toasted wood. Maybe some mildly bitter wood that plays out nicely and adds to the complexity. Excellent finish, it really comes alive hugely on the finsih and completes the experience

**********

I think this is my first cask strength Calvados, and probably my oldest too. And it's excellent. Thick, effortlessly smooth and complex. It doesn't hit you as very woody at first, but it's there just very well integrated and balanced. Still plenty of bold apple-y calvados flavor. So much complexity to pick apart, it's really impressive stuff. In my experience so far Calvados performs so well at 40% that the boost in abv here isn't immediately apparent. But the finish is where it really comes alive and shines, gives that extra punch that lower abv Calvados is missing. I could go on and on, it's just excellent and probably the best Calvados I've ever had. I was maybe hoping to try a woodier Calvados for once, but I quickly got over that

Rum review #8

*************

**Damoiseau Rhum Agricole, 55%**

**Nose:** STRONG new make and grassy funk, it's like stale gasoline mixed with rotting vegetation and vomit. There's some syrupy sugar and grassiness, but mostly this is just foul. Reminds me of new make Scotch or Bourbon

**Taste:** Taste isn't quite as bad, a lot more syrupy sugar comes through, vegetal sweet grassiness, some vanilla cream and spice. But still lots of funky new make flavor that reminds me of young spirity Whisk(e)y, enough to turn me off. With some air and acclimation it becomes drinkable, but still not even close to enjoyable

**Finish:** Some mild ethanol and spice, sweet sugary vanilla cream, funk

*************

Wow this stuff is gross. I've had drinks before that I can appreciate even if it isn't quite my cup of tea, but this is totally different. I have no idea how people enjoy this or get past the strong new make and funk flavors. It reminds me a lot of White Dog Bourbon or young Scotch that's been aged in a super tired cask and has little to no wood influence. I just can't do this

wow, interesting. tried this side by side with two other agricoles, pere labat 59 and rhumJM 55 and this was my preferred of the three. I loved all three, though.

Edit: that tasting was a couple weeks ago, and gave me a reason to finally check out the duquesne 50 blanc which i am enjoying obsessively in 'ti punches lately.
I think 99% is being used in Ti-Punch here in France and on the islands there's a few hard core people that drink it like that. 

I would agree Rhum Blanc isn't necessarily the best for neat sipping, especially over 50%.
I wouldn‚Äôt drink it neat, but it makes great cocktails.
I wouldn't sip a 55% agricole rhum neither. Try Rhum Bologne 50% next time. It's made on the other part of the island and has a nice floral / fruity flavor.
Yeah, I‚Äôve had a bottle of this stuff for a few years now. Cant find a way to use it. I totally agree with your review.
I am curious, what other white rums have you reviewed and/or tasted and which ones did you like in comparison?
Does this stuff just taste like cachaca?
It has some fans I think that enjoy it neat. But yeah, I was told I really need to try it in a ti punch so that's my plan to make some this weekend
i will say that i typically utilize the spirit in a ‚Äòti punch because i use the jm cane sirop which compliments the spirit so well, but i really enjoy these rhums for their toasted sugar cane qualities. much more subtle flavors than, say, a clairin, but i would have no qualms drinking them neat
That's what I hear, gonna make some ti punch with it and see how it goes! But it was indeed recommended to me as a rum I would enjoy based on me liking a rhum clement single barrel I had
Oh good thanks haha. In my other group, people keep coming out saying they love this stuff. Thought I was taking crazy pills. Good to see someone that agrees. Sorry about having a whole bottle of it though
So far I've loved the high ester clear rums, clairin le rocher and rum bar overproof and Savannah herr. Dok trelawney is like my holy grail of rum, it's amazing stuff.
Sorry I dont know what cachaca is
if you can find it, i really recommend using sugar cane syrup over like a rich simple or demerara syrup. rhum jm makes a sugar cane syrup that really complements the flavor profiles of the rhum. another thing, don‚Äôt simply use lime juice, cut out a lime cheek and muddle it in the glass you‚Äôre using to express the oils and get a smaller amount of lime juice. think of it almost like a rum old-fashioned
While more complicated, I really like it in this daiquiri variation. 

https://cocktailwonk.com/2016/01/turn-your-daiquiri-up-to-11.html
I‚Äôd actually be curious about making syrups with it. Maybe I‚Äôll try some in a base for falernum for steeping.
Thanks for your answer!
An other white agricoles that you tried / liked?
It's Brazil's national distillate. Very similar to rum, but made from fermented sugar cane juice, not molasses. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacha%C3%A7a
That would still be rum wouldn't it? Isnt lots of rum still made from sugar cane juice? Such as rhum agricoles?
>rhum agricoles

I had to look up what rhum agricoles was. Yes, it would be the same."

But it wasn't certified and can't carry a true age statement, hence the ""lot 73."" This is actually kind of a re-review, I've already done this but it was as a mystery sample. So I wanted to give it a proper review as well. Here is my original mystery sample review: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brandy/comments/egu53h/review_jeanluc_pasquet_lot_73_503_done_blind/

Brandy review #44

*************

**Jean Luc Pasquet Cognac ""Lot 73"" afish pick, 1973 46(?) year, 50.3%**

**Nose:** Lots of wonderful fruitiness, grape, strawberry jam, raisin, fresh mahogany wood, cigar box, sweet vanilla, light chocolate and toasted oak, menthol. The wood is complex but very mellow for the age, balances with the smooth fruitiness very nicely.

**Taste:** Smooth tannic wood, it dries out and puckers my mouth a little, tobacco, vanilla, sweet toasted oak and strong wood spice, milk chocolate. The fruits finally arrive on the tail end but it's muted, mild cocao and smooth sweet grape. Has a delicate and smooth sweetness with lots of complex wood notes that all meld together

**Finish:** Big sweet wood spice, milk chocolate and toasted oak, sweet vanilla, mild grape. Really delicious wood spice and vanilla lingers

*************

This stuff is all about mellow and balanced flavors, nothing hits very hard at all despite the age. The oak notes are interesting and incredibly complex but never heavy handed. The fruits are really nice on the nose but light and understated on the palate. It all melds together nicely and sweetly. It's maybe just a little bit too delicate and dry for my tastes, I'm a sucker for bigger and punchier flavors. But it's great stuff and I enjoy it for what it is.

Bourbon review #217

*************

**Nashville Barrel Company single barrel Rye (MGP), Bourbon Finds/Shared Pour pick #155, 8 year 58.56%**

**Nose:** This is a woody one, but still has tons of Rye character coming through. Big toasted oak, cacao, charred minty chocolate, big clean herbal Rye, herbal minty spice, green apple, wood spice and barrel char. Really nice oaky-charred and minty Rye nose. Maybe even a little dill in there

**Taste:** Right away there's big clean herbal and minty Rye flavor with balanced rye spice, delicious toasted oak notes, vanilla, some dark cherry, sweet wood spice, cacao and tannic wood that doesn't get too overwhelming, sweet minty char. Plenty of wood but never feels too oaky at all. It's a strong bold Rye that won't get confused with a Bourbon, just the way I like it.

**Finish:** Big blast of sweet minty and peppery Rye spice, calms down into sweet cherry, toasted oak, bold delicious Rye flavor. The herbal Rye, mild spice and sweet oak lingers

*****************

I'm a complete Rye fiend and this stuff hits the spot. No doubt it's one of the better MGP Ryes I've had in some time. The age works very well here, lots of strong oak but it still holds onto it's fierce Rye character. I've been lamenting the loss of MGP Rye ""honey barrels"" ever since we lost the sourced Willett and Smooth Ambler Old Scout stuff some years ago. This is the kind of bottle that gives me hope for the future.

Nice find! I saw a few of these on the shelf my way, but they were a bit over a Benjamin each and I decided to hold off for the time being. Curiosity set in between then and my next visit, but by the time I made it back to get one they were all gone. 

Mouth watering review; glad you enjoyed it! I‚Äôll have to pull the trigger next time I come across a bottle.
these are pretty good. a local did an 8yr single barrel and it sits on the shelf, i assume due to the $100 asking price. $100 is a far cry from the $45 i used to pay for SAOS ryes, but in this day and age, it's not the worst for something that's good and available.
Oh wow. My gf just picked this up (barrel #30) for $75 which is crazy since the place we got it is usually more expensive than average. Still a good pour though!
[deleted]
This post is top shelf shit. Thank you
Agreed, I think $100 is reasonable in today's market for this. At least it's not like Willett, $150-$200 for similarly aged stuff. I hear that Willett is great though
I think even the owner of smooth ambler has lamented selling all that MGP for so cheap. I think the days of $45 aged MGP rye are gone
What are the specs on it, age and abv? Is it Indiana distilled?
May I ask at which big red?
Yes I have been noticing more 7 and 8 year stuff lately. But the age has been slowly creeping up on these over the last several years, so it doesn't seem totally out of nowhere to me. For a while it was all 4-5 year stuff such as Bonesnapper, 6 year stuff like The Senator, then I was seeing 7 year barrell stuff, and now the 8 year stuff is coming around more. I just hope the trend continues

I paid $120 for this. Sorry about that, I meant to throw that into the review
i personally would choose 8 year mgp rye over willett distilled rye 10 out of 10 times. i don‚Äôt particularly care for willett‚Äôs own distillate these days. it all has this cinnamon funk that i just can‚Äôt shake.
Sure, here are pics of the front and back. Bought at Big Red in Indiana on Saturday

The big one downtown btown. Twas the last one but idk if they put out more since
likewise!
Seriously ... tastes like cinnamon red hots for days. It‚Äôs the worst
Cool thanks for sharing pics. Yeah that all looks like a really similar bottling to mine. I figured I overpaid a little, but thought MSRP was right around $100 on these. That's crazy cheap for $75. Are you sure that's what she paid?
I am, as i was with her. Here is a pic of the email they sent out confirming that 

https://imgur.com/a/PHtKrPS
For what it‚Äôs worth mine was 100 too. Can‚Äôt wait to open mine after reading your review!
Thanks for all the info and pics! That is an amazing price on these, you aren't likely to find that anywhere else. Enjoy!"

Brandy review #43

***************

**Lemorton Reserve Calvados Domfrontais, 40%**

**Nose:** Bright, crisp, fresh. Delicious caramel apple, bright tart pear, sweet and sugary. Feels very upbeat and refreshing.

**Taste:** The upbeat spirit of the nose carries through to the palate. Bright sugary apple, toffee, maybe some pear but it mostly feels very caramel-apply to me. The pear might help with that crisp tart sweetness on the mouthfeel. The light toffee balances it out beautifully

**Finish:** Sugary sweet apple and easy toffee, mild spice, gets a little grittier and richer but still very sweet

********************

In a way these are hard to review. It's not so much that they are all similar, more like the differences are hard to put in words. They are all basically sugary sweet with bold apple and light caramel, but they still each manage to have their own distinct personality. This one keeps some nice light toffee notes for how bright and crisp it is, which I really love. Like most of the others it has a fantastic mouthfeel at 40%. You don't even think about the abv when you're drinking it, it just feels so right. What a wonderful bunch of bottles here and what a wonderful spirit

Yeah we may have been a little overly optimistic about it, but to some extent it's sorta 'if you build it they will come', you know?
Unfortunately I‚Äôve found that many people (even hardcore spirits enthusiasts) don‚Äôt know much about brandies, and have never even heard of Calvados. It‚Äôs also unfortunate how hard it is to get a hold of calvados, making it less likely for people to stumble into the category.

Calvados/Apple Brandy, and the brandy category in general, is in desperate need of more advertising and education."

Brandy review #42

*******************

**Roger Groult 3 year Calvados Pays D'Auge, 40%**

**Nose:** Delicious apple, bright and happy, mild sweet tartness, buttery & sugary caramel, has an easygoing juicy quality. It's on the lighter side. Such a pleasure to nose

**Taste:** Has that same happy and juicy quality to that the nose had. Juicy apple, sugary sweet icing, light caramel, an easygoing kind of tart sweetness to it. Delicious flavor, but it's maybe a little too tame. The mouthfeel is lacking just a bit. A very minor complaint though, it's balanced and delicious overall

**Finish:** A light finish of juicy apple, mild spice and brown sugar, light sugary caramel.

**************

Another delicious Calvados. These have all been so incredibly balanced and clean for being so young, and so full flavored at the low abv. I have a feeling that this stuff was pretty magical even when it was unaged, and the light sweet wood influence just adds a little extra something. I think the mouthfeel is noticeably lacking a bit here compared to the 42% Hubert and 44% Manoir but it still does decently well.

Brandy review #41

*******

**Domaine du Manoir de Montreuil ""Selection"" Calvados, 44%**

**Nose:** Smooth and balanced. Rich creamy apple, bold and mildly tart, caramel, brown sugar, mild spice tingle. Complex and inviting so far, maybe a little light but it smells delicious

**Taste:** Creamy apple and caramel, buttercream, brown sugar, some brighter tartness and spice zing but it melds with the creamy and mellow sweetness. Has a very controlled and mellow creamy quality to it but with great complexity at the same time.

**Finish:** Brighter apple and spice, sweet buttercream, a sweet and creamy finish

**************

This one feels mellow and creamy, It doesn't have as much of that bright ""pop"" of crisp apple flavor like the Hubert had. But still plenty of bold apple flavor that melds into the the creamy caramel and brown sugar. Great complexity. A really good choice bottling this at 44%; it does well at that abv but I feel like the more mellow nature might have been boring or overly delicate at 40%. Another delicious Calvados, especially at the $40 price.

**Domaine Hubert Pays d'Auge Vieux Calvados, 42%**

**Nose:** Bold apple that is crisp and bright and so darn clean, sweet and sugary, vanilla frosting, sweet caramel. Sweet and apple-y but it's balanced well by a nice light sugary layer

**Taste:** Well balanced and pleasant with a nice mouthfeel. Sugary sweet red apple, dessert pastry, light sugary caramel, musty funk, some mild spice heat creeps in. It's straightforward and simple but all the flavors are clean and bold and well presented. Decently rich mouthfeel for how easy and drinkable it is too.

**Finish:** Rich apple and light caramel with some nice spice, a surprisingly bold finish for this sweet little Calvados

****************

This is delicious however you look at it, and for the $35 price tag it's a ridiculously good deal. Bold apple flavor that scratches the Calvados itch nicely I think. Very quaffable. I wasn't expecting much from this so I'm completely surprised and impressed

They coould be slightly different too. This newer one just came out a few months ago, on the site they used all the same info and write-ups as that older one.

Rum review #7

***********

**Clement Rhum Agricole single barrel, K&L #229, Martinique, 56.6%**
 
**Nose:** Creamy and buttery wood, sweet funky rum, light green apple, menthol, gentle spice zing. It's very cool and understated, the notes all flow very lightly

**Taste:** Sweet caramel, pineapple, mellow tropical fruit, light buttery wood, vegetal funk. Nice funky fruit and light wood sweetness

**Finish:** Comes alive on the finish more with green vegetal notes, creamy menthol rum, sweet caramel, spice kick

****************
 
**Clement Rhum Agricole single barrel, K&L #49, Martinique, 56.6%**
 
**Nose:** Chocolatey wood, mellow vegetal rum, funky banana, caramel, spice. Like 229 it's still quite mellow and understated
 
**Taste:** Chocolate, spice, heavier wood, tropical rumsmooth creamy sweetness. Very mellow and balanced flavor with just a touch of brash spice heat
 
**Finish:** Wood spice and sweet caramel, menthol and vegetal rum funk

*****************

Both are mellow and balanced with decent wood influence. I don't think I could pick a favorite, both are good and both have their own strengths. More rum flavor and bright fruits come through on 229, but it still has a really nice sweet woody influence. 49 is more chocolatey and heavier wood, but some nice funk comes through. These are a little boring for my tastes though. I'm not super experienced with rum but I seem to prefer bigger funkier flavors, and high ester clear rum is my favorite. These are solid but a far cry from that. Objectively speaking though, in my totally inexperienced opinion these are a great buy at $29

Just saw the #229 pop up in the K&L email and wanted to find out more.  Thank you for the review.  

If I purchase a bottle, it'll mainly be used for making Mai Tais and other cocktails. I'm interested to see how the higher proof agricole rum will work in a Mai Tai.

**Nose:** Thick syrupy caramel, toffee, light strawberry and berry fruitiness, malt, honey, brown sugar, toasted wood and root beer char. Very cohesive and thick, love this nose

**Taste:**Thick caramel and honey, tart berry and wine, big spice, delicious smooth maltiness, toffee, smooth toasted wood, earthy wine funk(not heavy), healthy spice kick. It's a strong delicious wine influence but not overwhelming, there's lots of malt and caramel/toffee sweetness.

**Finish:** The peppery spice calms down into black cherry, tart berry, toffee, caramel toasted wood, mild wine funk and spices

*************

Really great stuff, I dig the dark sweet and toffee flavors with the lighter wine influence(even though it is full maturation in Sauternes casks). I really enjoyed this but it's a bit hot, and I had a suspicion that water would calm it down and make it come alive a little more. It didn't really help though. Calmed down the heat but leveled out the rich flavors too much and made it kind of boring. It's ok though, it's delicious and doesn't need the water

**Glen Moray 10 Chardonnay Cask, 43%**

**Taste:** Buttercream and caramel, sweet pastry malt, rich bready dessert notes, clean sweet wine fruitiness, vanilla and mild toasted wood. Considering the low abv and funky nose, I'm actually pleasantly surprised here. Really nice balanced flavor, straddling sweet malt and richer caramel fruits in it's light and drinkable way. Nice oily mouthfeel too

**Finish:** Sweet icing and pleasant wine fruits, light breezy pastry malt, honey, toffee. A sweet finish, light in an easy and pleasant way

***********

Wow this is surprisingly good. I wasn't expecting much from a low abv Glen Moray, and Chardonnay isn't a common wine barrel so I was thinking it was maybe a little cheap and gimmicky. But there is a 10 year age statement on it, and 43% is a good sign that they aren't totally cheaping out like a 40% does. A true crowd-pleaser of a Scotch, just sweet and pleasant and drinkable all around. I'm especially impressed by how clean and thick the malt comes through. Nice complexity and mouthfeel, good flavor and well balanced. For what it is I'm very impressed

This was rather a steal back in the day (i.e. circa 2013). I remember it being in stores for about $30 or wee bit less. Alas, I haven't seen it for many years and like a little noted endangered species, its passing from the scene is one small marker among many, of a bygone era.
Moray is really good quality for the price. They still have a chardonnay in their core range but sadly it's just a finish now. Really wish they would push out single casks but there's a good amount of IBs floating around.
Damn dude, you just made me shed a tear like seriously
Oh man came.here to say this. I grabbed a bottle 3-4 years ago for straight up $30 which is unthinkable these days. Even back then I thought it was a finish in Chardonnay casks and was skeptical it was a full maturation due to the price point alone. This was perhaps the best value bottle I've ever purchased
Hey, all we can do is to enjoy it as best we can & then move on. *Ichi-go ichi-e*, *No man ever steps in the same river twice*, etc.

**Nose:** Butterscotch with a wonderful oaky edge, charred oak, vanilla, nutty toasted pecan, caramel, mocha. Wow this nose is like oaky butterscotch candy, it's decadently good

**Taste:** Hot cherry and caramel, big exotic spice, bold corn sweetness, creamy butterscotch, clean toasted wood. The huge nutty butterscotch thing from the nose doesn't quite carry over, but it's a bright sweet and fun Bourbon. I really love the complex spice notes, they are strong but not hot. Really delicious stuff that is just fun to drink

**Finish:** Nice warm layer of exotic spice rides out with bold corn and caramel sweetness, some creamy wood notes. A sweet Bourbony and spice-y finish

*****************

I've only tried a few of these Maker's Mark Private Selects, and I wasn't a big fan. This is delicious though. Definitely one of the better ones I've had. Nose is always very important to me, and the nose here is just amazing. On the palate it's fun and complex, a sweet bright Bourbon with interesting spice notes. A pleasure to sip on

Maker‚Äôs is making excellent whiskey and folks are still sleeping on ‚Äòem. Last summer, a dusty (1970s) Maker‚Äôs 90 proof came into my possession and it totally rearranged my palate. Ever since, I‚Äôve come to find that almost every expression outside of the standard is delicious and worth owning. These picks can be a gamble but the payoff can be huge. Dig the review.
Thanks! I got to try some 90's Maker's Mark 90 proof, it was awesome stuff. Did a blind side by side with the modern version and it blew the new stuff away.

Haven't tried a lot of these Private Selects but I'm curious to try more
Almost 10 years ago Makers damn near shot themselves in the foot planning to water down further and got so much backlash they had to flip a 180 and maintain and move forward like ok my bad bruhhhs. Lol, but now we have Private Selects, Cask Strength, Limited/Finish series. 

Love Private Selects.

If you enjoyed old Makers. Man try some prefire EC, or ND Old Grand Dad line. Especially the ND stuff, night and day different vs Old Granddad/114 today, someone that enjoys that stuff today would spontaneously combust if they had the ND stuff. Forget better, it's literally night and day different in profile."
"Review #513: Willett 7 year Rye (MGP) single barrel, 59.8%",,https://i.redd.it/8pyr0er6jkz61.jpg,"This is an older single barrel bottling, Indiana distilled. From back when they were sourcing their Rye from MGP for these single barrels.

American Whiskey review #215

***************

**Willett 7 year Rye (MGP), single barrel #671, 59.8%**

**Nose:** Big clean minty rye, dill, toffee, rich toasted oak, chocolate coffee, big fruity cherry, warm herbal spice. A wonderful Rye nose. The minty & dill Rye notes are strong and clean, oak is rich and balanced, just the right amount of delicious fruitiness spice. Cohesive and richly balanced

**Taste:** Big clean Rye notes of minty chocolate, dill, delicious warm herbal Rye, darker notes of toffee, rich deeply toasted oak, black cherry syrup, wood spice, caramel wood. It's oaky with a darkly sweet edge to it, but the Rye stays clean and bold. It all balances together perfectly. Has a big hot mouthfeel that is packed with rich dark flavor and fun Rye action

**Finish:** Big clean Rye spice and brighter sweet cherry builds, sweet caramel, minty char, the minty herbal rye sweetness lingers a long time. 

***********

This stuff is a zinger. Even at a similar age this is on another level compared to modern MGP Rye I've had. Tons of delicious oak and dark sweetness but with bold clean Rye character that is right up front at the same time. A complexity that all comes together hotly and hugely. I don't know what happened to all these honey barrels that Willett and Smooth Ambler Old Scout used to get but I miss them. This stuff is special to me, and I'm trying my best to be objective. But I really think it drinks like something very special

Should mention price! I think MGP has some great older rye out that can match this for less than what this bottle costs. Secondary has this as high as BTAC stuff.
Love thes old WFE ryes.
is Rye bourbon?
The difference nowadays as it‚Äôs not just high west, willet, and a few others competing for MGP rye. Now there are ton of non-producing brands battling for the best mgp stuff.
Are Willet products overrated? Never tried but curious.
I grabbed a few of these in SD around late 2016 for $80 and have one left. Kicking myself for not getting more. Great stuff.
I have a bottle of this is anyones interested
I don't really follow secondary, but I bought this about 5 years ago for $70. There is still some really good MGP Rye out there for sure. I've really liked the Senator Barrel Proof and Redemption 10yr, and Nashville Barrel Company is doing good stuff. But so far, from what I've tried, none of those match the older 7-10 year Willett and Smooth Ambler Old Scout single barrels
Rye is different from Bourbon. Bourbon is made from corn, Rye is made from Rye grain. If you're asking why a Rye review is posted in r/Bourbon, it is allowed. This sub is for all American Whiskey
That's a good point, but I've tried a lot of these modern MGP Rye brands and none of them seem to get barrels of this older quality. Just wondering WHO is getting the greatest barrels now. Maybe it's all luck and hard to know for sure. We are only just recently starting to see 7-8 year barrels come back so hopefully the truly great stuff is on the horizon again
I've always been impressed with their rye for being such a young age actually, and I feel they will just get better as they get older. But the 4yr small batch is solid at around $50-$60
The Estate line definitely not, quite hard to find their older Estate stuff now, but the 4yr WFE Rye is too notch. They have the distillate absolutely dialed in perfectly at that age. Probably my favorite overall sipping Rye, and its a unique mash profile, not a high or barely legal mash.
As far as the family reserve stuff‚Ä¶ Not in the slightest. I‚Äôve been drinking willet since the wax seal era. I couldn‚Äôt believe that for such an amazing whiskey, it was only $32 a bottle. Currently work at a bar with over 25 different single barrels of willet. 

Good news is even though it‚Äôs not single barrel anymore, the 4 year small batch rye is quite outstanding. Solid 8/10, probably 9/10 for most people. 

Don‚Äôt be fooled by the young age of rye. its sweet spot is generally in the 6-7 year age, IMO
Same! Bought 4 or 5 around the same time, they went for about that price at bevmo and then I would use the $10 or $20 off coupons to get them
The 4 year can easily cost $70 these days.  This would be in the hundreds if you find it.
nebco got some good ones recently
oh gotcha. not trying to gatekeep I've just noticed Rye gets posted here too so I thought I'd just go ahead and ask. thanks !
Secondary for anything over 4 years is gonna run $500-3k
No problem, happy to help"
"Review #512: Port Charlotte OLC:01 2010, 55.1%",,https://i.redd.it/eso66yijeez61.jpg,"Quite the production from Bruichladdich on this one, who are no strangers to zany cask antics: Initially aged in a blend of Bourbon, Vin Doux Naturel and Syrah casks, then finished for 18 months in ""a standout parcel of genuine Oloroso hogsheads"" from Fernando de Castilla in Jerez Spain.

Scotch review #233

************

**Port Charlotte OLC:01 2010, 55.1%**

**Nose:** Big toasted wood and heavy coastal peat, creamy vanilla, brine, tons and tons of funk, bitter wine, red fruits, strong hot spice. As usual with Port Charlotte the Peat notes are wonderful, but the funky bitter wine and spice isn't totally clicking for me

**Taste:** Caramel, funky wine, smooth heavy smoke, creamy vanilla, tannic wood. A subtle sweet and creamy fruitiness, mellow spice, wine funk, mildly sulfury red fruits, anise and spice. Plenty of that signature clean coastal Port Charlotte smokiness. But the PC smoke is the main attraction here, because as a sherried/wine aged Islay it's kind of boring.

**Finish:** The wine pops more on the finish with mildly sulfury sweet fruits and vanilla, descends into big smooth smokiness, coastal brine, light chocolate, sweet ashy char. Nice sweet peaty finish

*********

It's a solid Port Charlotte, but I'm not crazy about it. The nose of a Scotch is always super important to me, and the nose here is off-putting. Flavor is better luckily, but still nothing special. Especially for the $125 I paid. It's still a solid Islay. I might just hold Port Charlotte to a higher standard because I know the greatness they are capable of. When I think of all the big crazy flavors That Bruichladdich gets from wine casks in their Laddie and Octomore and lots of other Port Charlotte bottlings, this just feels a bit tame. The MRC:01 was better and had a much more interesting wine profile imo

Huge Bruichladdich fan. I like this release a lot. But I‚Äôd rather drink PC Islay Barley.
This is the only one of their recent limited editions I haven't tried, and I'm not really curious to seek it out. 

Went ahead and bought a PAC:01 though, that sounded a lot more interesting
I‚Äôve tried this only once and while it was solid I agree that it was a bit underwhelming especially for the price
Hi u/buckydean,

Thanks for the review. It sounds like I'd probably not like this one as well. 

I've only just recently tried Port Charlotte (Heavily Peated 10). I thought it was enjoyable (and I'm not a peat fan). Are there any other standout Port Charlotte's you'd recommend, or should I just stick with the 10? (Note: I'm not a Wine fan in general, so I'm not sure I'd like any French Wine cask finishes?) Thanks.
These special release Port  Charlotte's are going to be expensive and a bit hard to find, so if you're not always a fan of peat or wine finishes I wouldn't recommend seeking them out. But PC 10 is a heavily peated scotch, so if you like it then you might be a bigger fan than you think. Otherwise you can try some other scotches with lighter smoke levels like talisker or ardmore"

Brandy review #39

**********

**Pouchegu 1980 38 year, Rare Armagnac Collection ""Mars,"" 49.5%**

**Nose:** Balanced in a thick and elegant way. Dark cherry cola, chocolate fudge, dark fruity grape, smooth rich wood, tobacco, syrupy dark caramel, a wonderful layer of warm wood spice. The fruits are reserved, wood is more chocolatey/mildly bitter

**Taste:** Thick syrupy cherry cola and rich caramel, smooth toasted wood, bitter chocolate, flavor slowly builds to big wood spice, fruity black cherry and dark grape, smooth wood. There's tannic oak and tobacco, mild rancio, but it all stays so extremely well balanced and thick. Very elegant and seamless presentation of all these big flavors 

**Finish:** The grape pops a little more bright and tart, dark tannic wood notes, plenty of sweet wood spice, trails off into some nice bitter oak, chocolate, and dark reserved fruits.

************

It feels a bit reserved at first, but it opens up so beautifully and there's a lot to unravel. Big flavor that is elegant and seamlessly balanced. There aren't any single notes that smack you in the face in a big way like bright fruits or heavy oak. It all just oozes together in a very cohesive way. Excellent stuff

For comparison I poured some 1981 39yr from last year to drink sbs with this, and the main thing that strikes me is just how similar they are. This 1980 is a little more chocolatey and bitter, the 1981 is a little more spicy and bright and sweet. But they are minor differences, the characters of both are quite similar. I probably slightly prefer the 1981 but would score them similarly

Thanks for this, curious if you have had this years release of Pouchegu and how your rank it compared to the other two.
Well said.
Boy do these look good. Thank you for the review.
/r/armagnac to go private on your request

If you read the final paragraph of my summary, I give a short comparison between these two releases. 

K&L released two different 1981 39 year pouchegus very close to each other, one in 2019 and one in 2020(which i think is the one you are talking about). I've had them both and they are extremely similar. Here's my review of the first one from 2019: https://www.reddit.com/r/Armagnac/comments/ko3vfw/review_442_pouchegu_1981_39_year_rare_armagnac/

Scotch review #232

************

**Craigellachie ""Exceptional Cask,"" 1999 19 year, refill sherry butt, 55.2%**

**Nose:** Bold and delicious nose. Big buttery cream, clean sharp metallic caramel, tons and tons of classic Craigellachie meaty sulfury malt, nice warm spice layer, musty wood, light strawberry and prune, floral sweetness. It really jumps out of the glass at you everything is just huge. Fiercely meaty and Scotchy

**Taste:** The flavor holds onto that huge meaty and bold character that the nose had. Bold and clean caramel, ridiculously thick & meaty sulfury malt, god you can almost chew on this. Buttercream, sweet barley grain, warm peppery and complex spice layer. A light sherry funk and sweetness but it's steamrolled by the thick sulfury malt. This is just HUGE

**Finish:** Epic finish. Peaks with thick sulfury malt, chewy caramel and spice, bright barley sweetness, sweet fruity and floral notes. It's a vaguely sweet/fruity and thick/malty amalgam that is huge and rides out for a long time

********

The name of this stuff is not misleading at all, it truly is an exceptional cask. Even as a big fan of the distillery this is probably the best Craigellachie I've ever had. The thick meaty and sulfury style they are known for is on full display here and dialed up to 11. The sherry gives some interesting accompanying notes but it's not the main attraction. Everything about this is huge and meaty and complex and delicious. Just wow

Great review, thanks! I have a similar experience with a Craigellachie 23 exceptional cask in my closet. The thick sulphur is so strong that it is like drinking a firework, gunpowder and all, in this strangely savory and alluring way that compliments the sherry layer. Just bonkers stuff and in the best way possible if you are a fan of that style of whisky.
Very nice, I picked this one up for $200 and it might be the best buy I've had in years.  This outperforms many whiskies in the $400+ range.  Cheers!
Great review.  These are just so well done.  The team at Dewar's have been very judicious in the use of ""ECS"" and I'll always consider one a strong potential purchase.  Hope we see another round soon and maybe some Brackla or Aultmore.
Oh I heard that 23 year was great too. I'm impressed by this one and want to try more. Bonkers stuff indeed, so good
Where did you find a bottle? I‚Äôm quite curious!
Cool, glad I'm not the only one who found this extremely impressive.and yeah I would do this for $200 if I had access
Binnys Chicago.  Search their website, they had several in stock but that was a few months back.
Great review. I heard about this one from u/Solid_Snaku, so a big thank you to him. It is tastee.
Man it sure is. I'm gonna be keeping an eye out for these craigellachie casks in the future
Ayyy!  Glad you enjoy!"
"Review #509: Loch Dhu 10 year ""The Black Whisky""",,https://i.redd.it/kb9qvqoqjmx61.jpg,"A gimmicky bottling from Mannochmore released in the late 90's. It has a somewhat notorious reputation for the ridiculous amount of e150 that is clearly used. From the back of the bottle: ""A fine malt, patiently rested in charred, sweet oak casks to create a Whisky as black as night. With a rich velvety taste savour the smooth, intense flavour and discover hidden complexities in this unique Black Whisky.""

Scotch review #231

********

**Loch Dhu 10 year ""The Black Whisky,"" Mannochmore distillery, 40%**

**Nose:** I hope it's not just the color getting to me, but it does indeed smell darkly charred and sweet. Dark sweet cola, dark and concentrated, vanilla, sweet char, pastry malt, black licorice, balsamic, light menthol, vanilla toasted wood. It's actually a nice and interesting nose 

**Taste:** Straightforward kind of 10 year easy sipping 40% single malt flavor but with some darker burnt elements. Caramel, smooth malt, vanilla, lots of sweet toasted wood, burnt fruits. Darker concentrated flavors butt in with dark bitter oak, balsamic, sweet char and black licorice but it stays light and mostly inoffensive at the low abv. It has a nice oily mouthfeel that feels full flavored and smooth at 40%

**Finish:** Dark burnt caramel and sweet char, burnt grape, sweet toasted wood notes, bitter balsamic. A short but tasty finish

**********

As far as a gimmicky young 40% Scotch goes, this isn't bad. The flavor matches the ""Black"" gimmick pretty well which is cool to me. And they did it in an old fashioned smooth and drinkable 40% kind of way. It has that dusty quality of having a nice oily mouthfeel for only being 40%, back in the days when better barrels and older Scotch were regularly used even in basic bottlings. I don't want to oversell it though, it's nothing amazing. And the color is just comically ridiculous, makes it more of a testament to e150 caramel coloring than anything else. But it's better than I expected especially compared to modern 40% Scotch. I could see other people having trouble with the dark and bitter flavors here

A much more positive review than [the last time I saw this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/knt34i/review_541_loch_dhu_10_capping_off_a_terrible/), haha
Hah, that stuff looks like prune juice. Sounds kind of interesting.... but a lot of ""burnt"" notes. Thanks for sharing.
I wonder if those (or at least some) ""dark flavors"" are a placebo from the color and the description on the back. Not doubting your tasting or anything, just thinking it would be really cool if it was placebo cause that could open the door for a lot of interesting experimentation with whiskey. 

Nevertheless, looks like a really cool bottle/whiskey and I'd 100% get one if I saw it in a store.
Why (I mean ‚Äûhow‚Äú) is it black?
Is e150 actually flavorless? At those quantities I would expect it to impact flavor.
I would totally buy a bottle of this to use as our club‚Äôs ‚Äúhazing whisky‚Äù for new members.
Great review of a unique whisky. 

Dark rums are a much easier way to experience this level of e150.  Coruba dark, Meyers dark and Cruzan Blackstrap are all widely available unaged and heavily dosed.  And you can go side by side with their unaged white or gold rum (Meyers is appleton/J.Wray).  They are not quite as loaded with e150a as this, but are close and you can definitely taste it.  As someone who makes alot of tiki cocktails, I taste the raw ingredients to know how they'll mix into the cocktail and I've got around 50 rums including 3 different dark rums.

I would expect heavily charred barrels to also contribute some caramel and potentially bitter flavors of their own.
Yes! Haha

I discussed this dram with u/the_muskox and he was thrilled I enjoyed it as much as I did. I dont think I swayed his opinion on it though
It's different for sure, odd but interesting
Yes, I know what you mean. I tried really hard to be as objective as possible. I was even sipping it at times with my eyes closed, imagining the color being lighter and how it would taste to me. I think I did a decent job of letting the whisky speak for itself, but I'm still only human so a little bias might have kept in from the color haha
Yeah I'd love to have this one come up in a truly blind tasting.
I'm not sure if you're aware, but Scotch is allowed to use a flavorless caramel coloring called E150a. Most of the time it's used more discreetly to give Scotch a darker hue since that looks prettier on the shelf to many consumers. This Loch Dhu took it to an extreme
It's supposed to be flavorless, but there have always been people who swear it can effect a whisky. I dont know if anyone has ever had a chance to chug straight E150a to really see how the stuff tastes on it's own in larger quantities
I know that. Just didn‚Äòt know of that was how they darkened this whisky so strong.
I did find this where he says there is a difference in a blind test:
https://whisky-discovery.blogspot.com/2013/04/e150a-experiment.html?m=1#:~:text=The%20E150a%20liquid%20is%20a,a%20little%20more%20more%20unpleasant.
Most likely that is the case, there's just no other way to achieve this naturally. Even the oldest and most wettest cask sherry bombs dont begin to approach this level of blackness"

**Jim Beam 100 months old(8.3 years) ""Ducks Unlimited 50th anniversary"" decanter, 1987, 40%**

**Nose:** Smooth, rich and delicious. Big deeply toasted oak, pecan, creamy caramel, maple, leather, big fruity warm grape, vanilla, cool balanced menthol spice and slight char. Fantastic nose, so rich and oaky but in a creamy and balanced way that is super inviting

**Taste:** Thick syrupy caramel, maple, deeply toasted oak, vanilla and sweet char, warm smooth corn sweetness, sweet creamy caramel wood. The caramel and wood notes are smooth and full flavored. I'm not gonna lie and say it drinks way above 40%, it definitely feels a bit light. But It drinks better than most modern 40% stuff I've had

**Finish:** Sweet maple, smooth corn and mellow spice, rich woody caramel, toasted pecan, leaves with faint sweet wood notes

*************

A really cool Bourbon, very tasty and drinkable. It does feel a little light at 40% unfortunately, but I think it outperforms most modern 40% stuff. The nose especially is just fantastic, so rich and complex. None of it reminds me of any modern Jim Beam I've ever had. Like some other dusty Bourbon I've had it has an impressive kind of deep oakiness that manages to stay very smooth and warm and drinkable. Has a nice creamy feel to it too. 

Sometimes with these older Bourbons I find it helpful to transport myself back in time. Back when things didn't all have to be barrel proof monsters, and people were content to sip on a smooth drinkable Bourbon. This one drinks very well in that way

Bourbon aside, I must say the decanter is a very cool one for a natural lover.
I have one of these from the 1972 Kentucky derby, found it about 11 years ago unopened at an antique store when I was in my early 20‚Äôs. Back then I liked to think I had a decent palate for whiskey but when i tried it I didn‚Äôt care much for it so it ended up in storage for years. Fast forward about 8-9 years I revisited the bottle and it blew me away, very much like your description, sweet, buttery mouth feel, super oaky, and very smooth.
Big fan of the chimp picture
Very cool find! 

Very curious what you paid for that, if you don‚Äôt mind me asking.
Thanks for the unique review, I'm curious if they will ever bring back these collectible bottles or why they were ever discontinued.
I nabbed one of these about 7 years ago. Still haven't cracked it, but man does it make a statement.
Found a '74 a few months back and bought it out of sheer curiosity. I'll buy every single one of them I see from now on..  The nose on this thing is chocolate covered cherry bliss! Little funk on the aftertaste but not in an off-putting way, I'm going to be real sad when I finish it
My dad gave me a DU 50th anniversary decanter for Christmas in ‚Äò87. I swore I‚Äôd not touch it until I retired. Well I did just that in December. Waiting for a weekend when my friends are all free and I‚Äôm finally breaking the seal. Good to know that other folks have just done the same and been pleased by the taste. You never know what to expect when you leave something sit for decades‚Ä¶
How cool! This one is very pretty, so can see the appeal
Natural lover......like Ron Burgundy.....as in he‚Äôs a natural? Or do you mean, liking hairy ladies?  You could put sex panther in that duck I suppose.
That's so cool you were able to find something like that, and that you were able to hold onto it long enough to appreciate it. Tastes really can change a lot over time
My uncle grabbed it for me at an estate sale. So I don't know exactly how much but it was probably pretty cheap
Sure thing, thanks for reading! These were an interesting phenomenon. Back in the 70's and 80's Bourbon wasn't selling so good, and these were one of the ways they tried to drum up excitement by bottling them in collectible decanters. It doesn't seem like the kind of thing that would come back in any major way, but who knows. I could see a distillery doing it for fun as a throwback to these classic bottlings
See these on a group on FB every day for sale.... actually I just bought a 71' Buffalo Bill for $75+ shipping üëç
What an awesome story thanks. Mine was just found at an estate sale, that's so cool yours is a gift from your dad all those years ago. Luckily if yours is like mine it has a gasketed screw cap which holds up better than a cork often does.
Ah. I meant nature. Sorry.
They absolutely can, when I revisited that bourbon I was totally blown away by it lol...
Yep that's exactly how I found mine! I've got a few I'm holding out on, seller has 5 of em so I'm just gonna buy the whole lot and see if I can get a discount

Brandy review #38

**********

**Grosperrin Lot no. 72 Grande Champagne Cognac, afish pick, 56.1%**

**Nose:** What a rich and luxurious nose, just beautiful. Dense and chocolatey, rich wood, leather, cherry syrup, dark luxurious stewed grape, rich vanilla, warm mellow wood spice. It flirts with being quite bitter and tannic but stays rich and chocolatey

**Taste:** Wow, deep and rich with tons of wood. I love it. Huge rich woody flavor, huge thick caramel, big toasted oak, leathery and tannic, sweet caramel, chocolate, drying wood. Just as it's barely starting to feel overly woody and bitter, tons of sweet creamy vanilla and chocolatey grape brightly emerge, with delicious building wood spice. It's just amazingly complex and delicious but so balanced at the same time. Tons of big flavor here to pick apart

**Finish:** Brighten up on the finish with sweet caramel, vanilla, tons of sweet toasted wood, delicious spice, chocolatey grape. A very delicious and pleasant ending to this complex and woody Cognac

Cognac can be hit or miss with me, I tend to be a bigger fan of Armagnac. But no question this stuff is fucking fantastic and speaks to my soul. It's so rich and big, tons of complex flavor and it's all delicious. I especially love all the heavy wood notes, running the full range from sweet and vanilla-chocolatey to dry and leathery and bitter. It's the kind of pour where every sip is an event

that's a very cool bottle thanks for sharing
Ooh even you scored this even higher than the 96! I'm not sure if I'll ever pony up for this, but it sounds lovely.
Great review! This really is an awesome bottle! I was blown away when we selected it.
That sounds like my kind of pour. Wish I was sipping it right now!

I have to laugh though - do you ever get skeptical of these Fine Drams descriptions? ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know the vintage because we lost the records... but fortunately we do still have the records that show the EXACT methodology and conditions of its distillation.‚Äù
Yeah, I was surprised about that too. Especially since I'm usually just not a big fan of cognac. This one was closer to an armagnac profile though I think. 9's are generally a rare score for me too

> I'm not sure if I'll ever pony up for this

Unfortunately, I have to buy it now after trying it
It's a quote directly from the Guilhem Grosperrin. They have to say it like that because the rules about vintages in Cognac are incredibly strict, which is why everyone is using lot numbers instead of four digit vintages, since no one really cares enough to adhere to the strict rules of the BNIC. They obviously know that it's from 1972, but they'll get in trouble with the BNIC if they say it, as the BNIC has not certified the cask. No other spirits category have rules this strict for vintages.  

Certified casks have to be sealed with wax their entire lifetime, and can only be opened in the presence of a BNIC representative. This is tedious and expensive, so most don't bother when everyone know what the lot system means anyways."

American Whiskey review #213

**********

**WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel, K&L #20234, 17.928 year, 56.3%**

**Nose:** Hot peppery spice, caramel, light maple toasted wood, syrupy hot cherry, strong menthol Rye. This is a hot and spicy one. Still quite sweet with plenty bold Rye notes

**Taste:** Hot cherry and spice, caramel, bold spicy Rye, sweet and spicy, black cherry, toasted wood. Has a dark syrupy cherry sweetness to it, with lots of spice heat and bold Rye flavor. Delicious flavor if you can get past the heat. Water helps it a bit. Balances out the heat and brings out more creamy caramel sweetness and fruits

**Finish:** Syrupy-sweet hot cherry and big Rye spice, light maple. The hot peppery spice stays with you a long time. Heat is tempered well with water, more fruity sweetness on the finish

********

This one stands out as a little different from the other two. It's darker and hotter overall. More dark fruits, slightly more woody, and much hotter. Another great Rye, it's complex and lively like the other two but with much different flavors. Water helps it get past the heat and balances it out a bit. On my first tasting this was my least favorite of the 3, but I'm liking it much more now even without water so air might help it as well.

**WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel, K&L #20015, 17.928 year, 55.9%**

**Nose:** Sweet butterscotch, sugary caramel, hot cherry, tons of peppery and menthol spice, clean bold rye, sharp fruity cherry and apple, some maple toasted wood. A big bold Rye that is delicious and amazingly complex. Grain forward. Fantastic nose

**Taste:** Sweet butterscotch, big blast of bright herbal Rye, peppery spice, hot cherry, some light sugary maple, clean and sweet. Tons of bright clean Rye flavor, a nice hot and spicy kick, not as oaky as it is syrupy and butterscotchy and sugary-sweet. Lots of big flavor but the age has balanced all the complex flavors extremely well

**Finish:** Sweet cherry and caramel, clean bold Rye, herbal and menthol spice kick. Lots of clean sweet Rye and menthol spice lingers. A lively and sweet finish

**********

The last barrel I did(#20239) was really good, but this one is way better. Huge flavor, bold and complex and sweet with just the right amount of Rye spice kick. It's all very bright and clean. The lack of any heavy oak despite the age still makes me think these may have been some old tired casks originally. But luckily 18 years has done them well.

**WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel, K&L #20239, 17.99 year, 56.3%**

**Nose:** Butterscotch, sweet and herbal, bright clean Rye, dill, sugary frosting, strong menthol and rye spice, bright caramel, slight funk. Grain forward with strong sharp Rye character

**Taste:** Thick creamy butterscotch, big blast of sweet herbal Rye and spice, cherry, caramel, bright peppery spice, floral sweetness. Tastes well aged but not super oaky at all. The interplay between the bold herbal Rye notes and creamy butterscotch wood is delicious, and it all feels very clean and streamlined. I love it

**Finish:** Bright peppery spice and citrus, creamy notes of caramel and butterscotch, green apple fruit, sharp clean Rye. The clean Rye flavor and sweet fruity spice lingers a long time

*******

Delicious and interesting Rye. The going theory on these is that rather than the standard Alberta stuff that WP usually bottles they managed to get some older Rye that had originally been thrown into some old tired refill barrels. And I can totally see that being the case here. Despite the old age it is not very oaky at all, still very grain forward. But it works well with the age. Much like the 17.5 year stuff that K&L released recently, it reminds me of the Rye version of a well-aged refill barrel Scotch that lets the malt grain shine.

Love this
TL;DR, it‚Äôs disgusting. That‚Äôll do pig, that‚Äôll do
Did you not like this one then?
It‚Äôs all relative anyway but no, this was a big disappointment to me. I really, really like their Piggy back rye expression
As much as I like it, I could see why some people wouldn't. Especially if you're looking for a more standard Rye profile with maybe more oak. But I'm a major Rye fiend and I love how unique this stuff is. I haven't tried the piggyback
I was really bummed when i bought a bottle to try. I was disappointed as well."

Scotch review #230

*************

**Dailuaine 2008 11 year, Cadenhead Binny's pick, Bourbon cask #800139, 56.3%**

**Nose:** Classic rich and malty nose. Grassy malt, smooth rich caramel, vanilla cream, sweet cereal barley, background minty spice, brine. 

**Taste:** No surprises here, like the nose it is a well executed classic malty Scotch. Thick oily malt, smooth caramel, buttery wood, rich cereal grain that is so thick you can almost chew on it, some sweeter cream and sugary dessert notes. No big oak or spice notes, stays thick and creamy-smooth

**Finish:** Some sweet spice and citrus, moves into buttery creamy caramel wood and smooth maltiness. The whole experience is very balanced and thick. Never feels too spirity or sweet or woody

***********

I've been very impressed by Dailuaine in the past, and this is another great one. No bells or whistles, just classic malty Scotch goodness. Smooth and balanced in a thick malty way. I'm a sucker for a good malt bomb like this

Great review. Glad you liked it. Nothing fancy, just a delicious 11 year old, bourbon cask aged dram.
Yes, completely agree. I feel like price is maybe a little high though for being a somewhat smaller name distillery. $90 right? That might still be in line with prices these days though
Yes, $90. A bit high normally for a a bottle to take a chance on but a Cadenheads bottling, cs and a distillery that I‚Äôve had good luck with, I picked one up in a heartbeat. Went back after trying it an bought another. Yes, prices have crept up but man it‚Äôs good. Let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôve had worse for more."
"Rendezvous Rye is getting a new label and new blend with more of their own distillate, and will now be a seasonal release",,https://i.redd.it/z65hdiwtvwv61.jpg,"Serious question ‚Äî what the heck is happening to High West? They‚Äôre one of my favorite distilleries and have always liked their different bourbon/ryes but in the last year they seem to cutting or changing so many of their lines. 

Not to mention, I always thought their bottle and labels were so classic. This new label is kind of meh...
Well this new label is horrible.
[Welp, was good while it lasted](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/48c265f0-1c11-482e-b2be-6fa9f23408d3)
An email I just got from High West distillery:

**RENDEZVOUS RYE HAS A NEW BLEND AND A NEW LOOK** 

**COMING TO A RETAILER NEAR YOU THIS MAY** 

""As we transition our flagship whiskey into a seasonal release, Rendezvous Rye has evolved to include more of our own coveted High West pot still rye!

**Technical Details** 

Proof: 92¬∞ 

ABV: 46%

Price: $69.99 

**How to Drink** 

Great neat, with a little water or on the rocks. The high rye mash bill also makes Rendezvous¬Æ Rye perfect in one of the classic cocktails made with rye, like a Manhattan, an Old Fashioned, or a Sazerac. 

**WHERE TO BUY?** 

Rendezvous Rye is now a limited national release, available at your local liquor stores this May and High West general stores in Park City and Wanship starting Saturday, May 1st.  

High West General Stores are limiting 2 bottles per person 

**A NOTE FROM OUR DISTILLING & BLENDING MANAGER, Isaac Winter** 

Rendezvous Rye has been through a couple of refreshes over the years since its initial release, but each time we‚Äôve tried to retain the soul of the product: an older rye whiskey that balances stunning rye spice with a sturdy maturation character.  

The current release has the same older column still base that features a rounded baking spice character (think all spice, soft cedar, and toffee) but we have been so thrilled with our own High West rye component we decided to include ‚Äòsignificantly‚Äô more in this release. Because we use a potstill to create this component we pull over a lot more ester and grain character. A blend of 4-9 yo lots, this component brings some dried fruit, leather, and candied ginger to the final product. Look for increased depth and dried stone fruit complexity from potstill-esters as well as slightly more maturation character. We hope you enjoy this new blend of a classic, as it was certainly a crowd favorite among our teams. 

Cheers,  

Isaac 

**THE ARTIST SERIES** 

The Artist series is an exciting new initiative for some of High West's limited release products. We wanted to give a special artist the freedom to explore their own interpretation of the West with our original label elements to guide them. Our first artist to help kick this off is Ed Mell, a notable western painter and sculpture who specializes in capturing the beauty, vastness and spirit of the landscape of the American west. Ed‚Äôs painting, entitled ‚ÄòWestern Bronc‚Äô, perfectly captures the original Horse and rider that was on our old Rendezvous label, with a contemporary spin. 

High West Distillery is home to pioneers of blending artistry and what better way to showcase the art of whiskey distilling than through an artist series that blends the humble beginnings of the old west with the new.  

See more of Ed Mell's work at edmellgallery.com
Constellation ruins everything it touches.
Hopefully this works out well. Rendezvous Rye is one of my absolute favorites, been though it‚Äôs overpriced. Will need to find an extra bottle just in case.
This seems like a bad thing.
The fact they can only claim ""significantly"" more of their own ""component,"" and can't describe at least a percentage is the most damning thing about their future product. They haven't released any info on how much they have been dosing previous releases, haven't released any 100% HW rye products (that I'm aware of), and are way too afraid to expose their distillate to the public. I don't blame them for keeping money makers in the lineup or for waiting until the right moment, but they are clearly not proud of something. 5% is 500% of 1%, which is significant, but we can't really give them credit unless we really understand how much of their own distillate we are tasting.
Knew this day was coming...so this means anything currently on shelves with the old label is the ""traditional"" blend of sourced stuff they've used from the start?
Sounds interesting, thanks for sharing! I wonder if this means MWND will be using this new blend as it base going forward
I agree that the new label is horrible. But I also thought their original labels were horrible. 

Having said that, I am looking forward to this. From day 1, HW stated that they were a producer, and I believe I read several pieces where they talked about using sourced whiskey as a bridge to when their releases would primarily be in-house product. At this point HW has been around for a long time, so this news is overdue, IMO. There are so many labels using MGP sourced stuff right now that I don‚Äôt mind a bit if HW weans itself off of it.
Well their distillate is pretty shit, so...............
I may be the only one who likes this new label, reminds me of Cubism artwork, I thinks it is refreshing and appealing, but just my opinion lol. That said, I‚Äôve been stocking up on their stuff that‚Äôs getting cut, too bad the way it‚Äôs gone over time :/
They spoke about this on a couple of  podcast last year. I‚Äôve been telling my friends who adore HW to buy it up because it is going down to a seasonal release.

The talking point from HW has been that they want to get further and further away from having as heavy of sourced blend in most products and to do so would mean cutting back on some skus.

They also mentioned by cutting back on RR as a daily shelf item, it would open the door to larger batches of MWND, meaning larger allocations, I.e, my total wine gets 3 bottles upon release and that‚Äôs it for the year.
So this is what's taking over Yippee Ki Yay's spot in the yearly limited cycle, I guess.

I always used to recommend this stuff for people looking in the $50‚Äì60 range, but I don't dare to hope that the quality doesn't continue to slip
That probably means a new price and harder to get
Rendezvous rye might finally be worth the price tag now. Would you compare it to your old Rendezvous Rye please u/Prepreludesh?
Been curious to try high west, but i don't really want that ugly bottle on my shelf. Before the change i'd almost buy a bottle just because it looks cool
Bottles with the old label are going to get hoarded up in no time.  Rendezvous Rye is a solid product IMO and I have no reason to think the new label will make any difference, but it‚Äôs predictable his people will react, especially HW fans and collectors in general.  

Now if you‚Äôll excuse me, I‚Äôve got a couple errands to run, will be back in a couple hours.
Interesting. Good thing I‚Äôve got a bottle of the original that I can hang on to and compare to the new version.
sweet been holding a few 2016 RR
I hate the new label but I like the new MWNDs so I am torn but will probably try it anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Boooo
Just picked up a couple bottles of 2018 on the clearance shelf.  Good but not like the older stuff.
Should I buy up current rendezvous for my personal drinking?
Seasonal? I had heard it was distillery only...
We still carry this at my work with the old label. Should I snag one before things change?
This has got to be a ploy to drive sales. I've always enjoyed Rendezvous, but for the price it's hard to justify. I'd much rather go with their double rye.
All the high west stuff if great
Yeah, I understood that, just comes down to preference and I like them all I guess. Not sure whiskey is less complicated than whisky though.  The opposite might be true.
I better stock up on Double Rye before they ruin that too...
To all who are hating the new label, at first I agreed, then I thought that it looks 100% unique and different from anything* else on a shelf. Good on them. It will attract a lot of new buyers. I actually like it. As far as the whiskey, I‚Äôm curious to see how the new blend compares to the old.
The label looks like one of those pictures a psychologist asks you to look at to find out what you see. I also see a mix of a Gundam Mobile Suit, a horse and Godzilla.
>High West? They‚Äôre one of my favorite distilleries

Isnt the thing that they were not a distillery but they are ramping up to be one?
Agree on the label, think it‚Äôs a big miss to switch from the classic labels to whatever this art is called
They were getting all their juice from MGP while getting their own stills running, now they are converting to their own juice, mostly blending with MGP, and I would think as they are moving to their own distillate they amend their product line. 


Also, RIP campfire, I think I was the only person who liked it.
HW is basically dead at this point. They had great products with sourced material but have essentially sold out and are trying to squeeze as much profit as possible.

The plan was never to have their core products be from their own distillate (source: from high west,  including AMAs on this very subreddit). Instead, they have been working in younger and younger rye while keeping the same product names. They also tried to shortcut their own rye by using small barrels causing them not to have a lot of usable older rye. Its a shame.
New Owners trying to make their mark/expand leverage sought after products to sell entry level prods in exchange for allocations. Corporate boards make stupid uncool decisions in booze all the time. They‚Äôll still probably pay themselves on the back because the brand still has plenty of room to expand but now they‚Äôll blame themselves instead of the previous owners...
They have enough of their own product to start these different releases/recipes.  Will it work?  Who knows.  Probably cheaper than sourcing.
It‚Äôs special artwork for a limited release.
I agree with this, but the truth is, they have been changing their blends for the past several years; and as a result, I feel as though the product has dropped a bit in quality.
I was in Salt Lake City last week and was told Diageo bought them.
It reminds me of Picasso‚Äôs Guernica.

Which is a great work of art and all, but not something to colorize, crop, and put on a bottle of whiskey.
ü§£ü§£ü§£
Did I read that right? Do they have their own distillate that is up to 9 years old, now?
What part of using their own ""coveted"" distillate do you not understand? This couldn't be better news /s
You'd think by now they'd have gone the Willett route and released some straight ryes of increasing age at a healthy proof.

But that's assuming they have confidence in their distillate
No. Theyve changed the blend several times. I dont think they have been 6yr and 16yr blend for a while now (which was the original blend). But even that allegedly changed as to who they were sourcing each component from at any given time...
I believe High West has already been increasing the amount of their own distillate in the last few MWND releases, so this transition has been going on for some time already
Cubanism lol üá®üá∫. Or just Cubism.
Yeah same here. I love the new label. I got the same email today before seeing this thread and the first thing I thought was, ""Hey, cool label"".
One of the good things about living in SLC...good opportunities to buy their smaller inventory stuff.  I still can't get up there on a weekday to wait in line for hours to get their really small batches though.
The good news is that this couldn't be any worse that YKY, damn that stuff is gross
Actually, this rye would likely be worse than previous iterations of RR.  Until High West has the confidence to release their own rye, unblended, then you'll have a hard time convincing me it's getting ""better""
I was thinking of picking RR but now I think I'll go for Pikesville.
> might finally be worth the price tag now

Rendezvous, like most if not all of HW products, has been getting worse while the price tag has increased. The original 6 year MGP + 16 year Barton was fantastic and it was $38. Given the specs, I'd be very surprised if anything about this was ""better.""
If you wanted to take a snapshot of the current Rendezvous because you think it's a perfect whiskey and any change would ruin it, then yes.

Otherwise, there are many ryes on the market, and even if this gets worse you'll still be spoiled for choice
They sourced a lot from MGP, then had MGP distilling their recipe for them while they ramped up production. Since they‚Äôre very popular it took them a long time and they still don‚Äôt meet the required production. 

They‚Äôre cutting back some items and going big on secondary aging as well.
They have distilled a little bit for the past few years, and their stuff usually ends up mixed in with or fully comprising the higher end stuff they sell. But yeah, they're trying to do more of their own distilling.

Source: went on a tour there in summer 2019 and saw their facilities and heard them talk about their future plans. Highly recommend going there on a pleasant summer day.
I agree as well - it looks too much like a wine label to me
They'll likely always source from MGP, but their secret to success was this big stash of 16 year Barton rye that they obtained early on. Then it ran out at the end of 2017.

Their bourbon also had a similar fate when their contract with Four Roses dried up. Initially they sourced old MGP bourbon but even that dried up. Now it's very young MGP blended with Old Dickel
Whaaaaaaaat. I know tons of people who loved Campfire. Damn is it really gone? Better go see if I can find a bottle
Wait, Campfire is gone!? I love that stuff
Definitely wrong about being the only person who liked campfire - I bought 7 bottles a month ago when I found out they would t be distributing it anymore!
Campfire's getting cut? NOOOO!

ETA: I see the link further down and that still depresses me. :(
You‚Äôre not the only one. My wife and I enjoy a good Campfire pour whenever the weather calls for it.
I liked it!!
I fucking love camp fire. Is it going in this direction too. If so I'm stocking up, it seems to sit on the shelves in my area.
Wait. Campfire is going? It‚Äôs one of my favorites
Campfire is one of my favorites!  I hear it's not going away.  You'll be able to get it at High West and it will be served at bars.
Oh wow I didn‚Äôt realiZe HW went under new ownership
Literally says this in the press release email they sent out lol
This is false.
Nope - they‚Äôre blending they‚Äôre own juice with MGP.
Totally agree. My only hope is that they are just being extremely patient as to not plow through their older product before a predetermined date and they will shock us by creating a regular or annual release 8-12 year age-stated product entirely of their own stuff, but I'm not holding my breath.
Ah gotcha, I got a bottle several years ago that I know is a 16/6 blend but not sure the exact source(s). Thought I might still be able to at least get that experience with what's currently on the shelf but probably just pass entirely.
Yup, they‚Äôve increased their percentage of distillate over the past couple years, I believe starting with act 5 or 6
Hmmm; is that why I thought Act 8 was a big miss compared to Act 7? All interesting info. Thanks for starting this discussion!
Hahah I didn‚Äôt realize I misspelled that, thanks for pointing it out...kinda üòÇ GO Cuba! üá®üá∫
At least there‚Äôs two of us lol yeah, same, first thought was ooooo, I want that! Haha
YKY was the first thing from high west I just ‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt like. Even campfire was my jam
Absolutely... they talked about releasing a 5yr rye 2 years ago... nothin... not sure if thats 'good they're patiently waiting until its great stuff...' or if its 'the stuff is basically grain alcohol so all we can really do with it is blend it in with a few good barrels of MGP, slap a diego rivera wannabe sticker on in and call it allocated...'
Which is concerning. 2.5 year MGP rye is friggin delicious.
Good choice. Pikesville is great.
I was there around the same time, definitely worth the trip!
> very young MGP blended with Old Dickel

And boy does it show. That Barton rye was fantastic.

‚Äúbecause we use a potstill to create this component we pull over a lot more ester and grain character. A blend of 4-9 yo lots, this component brings some dried fruit, leather, and candied ginger to the final product.‚Äù

to mean that they are using their pot still distillate in a range of 4-9 years old.

If that *were* true, I want to try a single barrel 9 year old High West Rye!
Act 6
Agreed!
Double Rye is a blend of 2 year old MGP rye and younger barrels of High West's own pot-distilled rye whiskey.  It used to be 2 year old MGP and 16 year Barton rye whiskey before 2018.

Rendezvous Rye is a blend of 6 year old MGP rye whiskey and now barrels of High West's own pot-distilled rye whiskey aged 4 to 9 years old.  It used to be 6 year old MGP rye whiskey blended with 16 year old Barton rye whiskey

American Prairie used to contain 6 year MGP bourbon and 10 year old Four Roses (this is when it was called American Prairie Reserve).  Then from 2015-2017 it was 2 year old MGP bourbon blended with up to 13 year old MGP bourbon.  From 2018 onward it is now a blend of 2 year old MGP bourbon and up to 13 year old Dickel.
When High West was purchased (by constellation brands iirc) they stopped publishing blend info.  Before that, they listed it very clearly on their website.  I always appreciated the transparency and was immediately skeptical when it disappeared.
Midwest grain products in Indiana. They make the distillate for hundreds of bourbons, who then age and blend them before slapping their own label on it.


For what it‚Äôs worth, their distillate is great. It‚Äôs not a bad thing that so many brands use them.
Miles per gallon
If you have any kind of a whiskey collection. MGP is a LOT of what‚Äôs on your shelf.  It seems like the list of brands that don‚Äôt contain MGP is shorter than the list that does.
I love smoky but there's tons of great scotch that'll scratch that itch.
Wow, that's insane. Thanks for the heads up, guess I better grab a few bottles while it's still on the shelf.
Gripes
Definitely not ideal.  Hopefully they'll change there minds.
Incorrect, Constellation owns them.
Found 4 bottles hidden on the shelf in a sleepy store, 106 a pop. Gold
Yep
The Long COVID Year was the year I realized all my favorite bottles were sourced from MGP or had their roots at MGP.
I taste peat where there is no peat, so none of this is up my alley.  I'm all bourbon, rye, or even Mellow Corn.  I've tried perhaps 20 Scotches, Irish and Japanese whiskeys and none of them appeal to me like a simple American whiskey.
Not bad, not bad!
Exactly why I wanted to stress that it‚Äôs not a bad thing for them to be sourced from there! People hunt for MGP products! Go take a look at u/T8KE and his r/bourbon barrel picks, one of which is a Nashville barrel company 8year old MGP rye. I bought it today, can‚Äôt wait to try it!
I‚Äôll keep my eye out for that one.  The MGP journey continues!"

Scotch review #229

**********

**Fettercairn 27 1988, Signatory Binny's pick, Hogshead, 60.2%**

**Nose:** Crisp malt, buttery and sweet, spice, some slightly acrid funk, green apple and spice that penetrates reeeally deep, floral sweetness. It's like a standard kind of youngish refill malty Scotch, but everything is just ""more so""

**Taste:** Thick buttery malt, bright barley sugar, some zingy spice and acrid funk, but still not overly hot at all considering the abv, big blast of sharp floral sweetness and spice, balanced bright fruits, richer buttery cracker. It's thick and powerful but has a bright and lively kind of floral and spirity feel at the same time. Big but zingy and sharp 

**Finish:** Floral and lively, a big powerful finish, bright tropical fruit, crisp clean malt, descends into some interesting gritty root beer and graininess that is really really good. The spice and sweet floral spirity malt lingers a long time

***********

A fun spirity Scotch. This has taken spirit-forward refill hoggy flavor about as far as it can go I think. Despite the extreme age the wood influence is minimal, it's all sharp and fruity and floral flavor with just a light buttery wood. It has everything that is familiar (and maybe even off-putting) in a young refill hoggy IB, but presented in a much bigger and more balanced way. I wasn't into it at first and then slowly came around. Still doesn't quite wow me but it's fun

Scotch review #228

********

**Highland Park 2008 10 year K&L Single Cask #7774, refill sherry hogshead, 61.6%**

**Nose:** Toffee, wood spice, dark toasted oak, cacao, hot cherry, chocolate wood, mild dark berry fruitiness, some wispy smoke that blends in with the darker oak notes. With some air time thick honey and creamy malt emerges. Not a typical ""lightly sherried"" malt, it has some serious oak and richness and spice 

**Taste:** Dark chocolate and toasted oak, hot spice, toffee, some thick sugary barley malt underneath all the dark oak and hot spice, honey, tart green apple and berry that never gets too strong or bright, black cherry and wood spice, light menthol smokiness. Powerful flavor here, it's delicious and complex but not for the faint of heart

**Finish:** Intense blast of syrupy cherry and spice heat, big toasted oak, undertone of creamy malt and honey, ashy char. Lingering baking spices, honey malt. It's a big finish

***********

I'm continually amazed at how good Scotch can be at these uber high abv's. It's got a fair amount of heat sure, but it also delivers tons of powerful flavor. This one is kind of all over the place. It's oaky and hot but there's some nice creamy malt, syrupy sweet notes, and even a little smoke that somehow all come together very well. Not a typical ""lightly sherried"" or ""fruity jaunt"" refill malt. Some very powerful flavors here. Still a little overpriced for what it is though I think

This is one of my rarest and most prized samples, so it seemed like a good one to break out for this. Cheers, I love this place and love all you fellow Whisk(e)y and spirits geeks!

American Whiskey review #210

**************

**Wild Turkey 1992 12 year 101 ""Cheesy Gold Foil,"" 50.5%**

**Nose:** Inviting and luxurious, a rich yet incredibly smooth nose. Rich decadent caramel, thick maple syrup, creamy butterscotch, smooth chocolatey wood, vanilla, cherry cola, balanced corn sweetness, toasted and creamy and dark. A very mild undercurrent of sweet wood spice

**Taste:** Rich chocolatey oak, woody and smooth. Smooth tobacco, woody caramel, delicious chocolatey toasted wood, maple syrup, balanced Bourbon corn. All the dark wood notes you could hope for in an older Bourbon presented in such an effortlessly drinkable way. On the tail end more dry and tannic wood builds with some mild minty spice and root beer, adds another layer of delicious complexity to this stuff.

**Finish:** Brief pop of wood spice then chocolatey toasted wood, sweet woody caramel, darkly bright cherry, vanilla, slowly fades into light caramel and vanilla char, and sweet wood spice. 

**********

God I love dusty Turkey. Wild Turkey at it's best tends to have an effortless quality to it, where it is amazingly good without feeling like it's even trying that hard. All the flavor just falls into place. Dusty Turkey always accomplishes this so well, and this one is another excellent example of that. It's a really fun trip back in time, when Bourbon didn't have to always be some barrel proof monster, and sipability was king. 101 proof was the middle ground to build up the mouthfeel and really give their Bourbon a great presentation, but keep things from getting too hot. In that regard this Bourbon accomplishes what it set out to do about as well as it can be done. That being said(and I always feel compelled to state this in reviews of prized bottles), it isn't the end-all of Bourbon. It can't really compete with a lot of modern barrel proof stuff, it's just too different of a style. I will say that it completely blows away any lower or similarly proofed stuff available today.

Anyone else get a kick out of ‚ÄúDarkly bright cherry‚Äù. Later this evening I‚Äôm going to check out the whitely black twilight ;-)
My favorite bourbon of all time. Nice review.
This is one of my bucket list pours, right up there with The Dalmore 35 year which I was able to try late last year.  I'm absolutely not willing to spend the money to buy a bottle of this, but hoping that eventually I'll get to try it.
Just had about an ounce of this a few weeks ago. This was a spectacular bottle. If anyone gets the chance to try it (obviously it will be a a few, because of availability), really take in what you‚Äôre drinking

This is probably the best Wild turkey offering I‚Äôve had. I‚Äôve had several of the Austin Nichols offerings from the 90‚Äôs and a few bottles from the 70s.  This WT CGF was above and beyond all those

Edit: autocorrect
My grail of grails. 500 is a huge accomplishment, congrats!
500 is no small feat. Kudos!
Wow!!! Big congrats on 500!!! Was able to glean a lot from your reviews and thanks for them. This is one I wish I run across someday.
Congratulations on number 500!
Congrats on the milestone - here's to the next 500, cheers!
a great one for #500 and looking forward to the next 500!
Congrats on #500! What an accomplishment!
Congrats on 500!
A rare treat. Thank you for sharing
congrats on 500!

i was lucky enough to trade for one of these a few years ago and it really is something special. my bottle is gone and 100% enjoyed the everlasting shit out of it.
Congrats on 500!
I guess I need to work on my first review!  Congrats and great writeup.  Keep them coming!
Congrats on 500! And what a bottle to do it with. I absolutely love CGF and hate myself a little bit for passing on them at $120 because I thought it was too much.
I was soooo hoping to score a bottle for my wedding date and even found a friend to split it with me. These went nuts on secondary and I had no idea these were north of 800 and just too rich for my blood. Cheers man and thanks for another awesome review!
Congratz my friend! What a great pour an review. Always a pleasure to read your reviews
Congrats!! And a lovely dream to celebrate with!!
Congratulations on hitting #500, Bucky!  I have always enjoyed your reviews and when my friends and I talk about them, we preface it with ""the guy that writes reviews on Reddit and has a picture of a monkey drinking from a bottle in the background"" haha!

Helluva bottle, but I agree on the real take on this one.  Too many people treat this bottle like the foiled label that wraps around it.  I must say that after tasting some dusty Wild Turkey samples myself that I've never really been blown away like the fanboys are.  In fact, I much prefer the OGD from National Distillers to any of these bottles.  Cheers!
Congrats on 500! Great bottle for such an achievement. I appreciate your reviews.
Congrats on 500 brother!
Well done on 500! And that‚Äôs an all timer pour for sure.
number #500! hot damn! congrats - I remember your very first, and what a dram that was (4.2!!) but you dug deep for something even more epic here. Great review!
I know it doesn't really make sense, but I don't know how else to put it in words haha
Good luck, I hope you get to try it someday!
I have a sample of the ""Donut"" bottling as well that I have high hopes for. I settled on this one for #500. Also got some 80's 8/101 and 90's Rare Breed, looking forward to seeing how they compare to this one
Thank you! Hope you were able to somewhat enjoy it vicariously through me, and I hope you are able to get some someday
Mine are pretty low effort compared to the ones you do haha, but yeah it's a lot of work sometimes. Fun though
Thanks dude, glad you have found some of my silly little reviews helpful haha
Thanks!
Cheers dude, thanks!
I'm looking forward to the next 500 as well, cheers!
Thanks!
I dont think I ever saw one that cheap, but I remember back when all these different dusties were going for about $200 and beat myself up for not trying to get one back then
Why thank you, and it's always great seeing you around too!
Thanks dude. I thought so too, it's fun to have an excuse to break into samples I'm normally scared to touch
Thank you so much! I have a lot of respect for you and your reviews, so that means a lot to me. I just think of these as silly little things I do for fun, so I'm glad when people find them enjoyable or helpful at all. Cheers!
Thank you! Wow, I can't believe you remember that haha. It took an epic pour like that to inspire me to review, and the epic pours are still the most fun to do.
I actually really like the review.  CGF is one of my favorites.  The 2020 masters keep touched on many of the same notes and was my favorite spirit of the year for sure.  I just got a ride out of the verbiage.  Cheers!
Vivid
I think this bottle was worthy of #500. Looking forward to your comparisons on the two. That velvety mouthfeel of the CGF was pretty memorable. 

Not gonna lie, I looked through your review history to see if we knew each other.
Is this hard to find?
I'm not in L.A., but I make it over there now and then(not so much since the pandemic started). But I don't think we would know each other
This Wild Turkey I reviewed? It's a bottling from 1992 so it's long gone. Some pop up now and then from people's old collections, and it goes for lots of money at auctions. So yeah not something you're likely to ever find
Wow that‚Äôs insane"

Brandy review #37

***************

**Jean-Luc Pasquet Cognac ""Lot 92,"" Afish pick, 61.4%**

**Nose:** Big bold and bright nose, it's almost Scotchy. Tons of sweet vibrant caramel, maple syrup, big clean floral notes, bold white grape, green apple, very bold and fruity, sweet and sugary, vanilla, big lively tingly spice.

**Taste:** Big lively flavor, never had a Cognac like this before. Huge sweet caramel with a big blast of clean vibrant floral notes and spice. Sweet bright fruits, almost tropical, green apple, bright grape, lots of lively and complex spice, sweet sugary dessert notes. So complex and fun, the flavor just grabs you and slaps you around

**Finish:** The huge spice slowly settles into a long finish of sweet luxurious caramel, light fruits and green apple, sugary dessert notes, floral, leaves sweet and caramelly with a faint spice tingle

***********

Wow, delicious and a whole lot of fun! It's the first cognac I've had that has really excited me I think. I often find Cognac to be a little boring for my tastes, but this is anything but boring. Lots of big bright floral and spice and sugary dessert notes, with light balanced layers of fruit and wood. It's hot for sure but it's a very fun and vibrant spice, not just an overly hot burn.

I think I preferred this to the lot 73!
I have this and the Grosperrin '96 on the way, super excited to take a malt break and this sounds awesome

Since you've had both and loved them, if you had to choose between the two, which would you opt for?
Did afish disclose any info regarding the age of this 92?
Very happy for this to be a cognac that you‚Äôre into!
I definitely preferred this one. I'm not a big fan of the lot 73, it's kind of dry and boring to me
That's a tought question. They are both excellent but quite different. The Grosperin 96 is an oak and chocolatey dark fruits armagnac, this lot 92 is bright and sweet and floral. I probably prefer the 96 myself, but I tend to like armagnac more than cognac in general. They're both winners for sure
So the name ""lot 92"" means this is a 1992 vintage. The story goes that a lot of these small producers don't meet all the strict requirements required to put an actual vintage year on the label. With a bottling date of 2019 I think that makes this about 27 years give or take
Me too! You guys did a great job on this one
Crying tears. Chose the Lot 73 over this:( 
Maybe, it is time to correct that while I still have the opportunity.
Thanks so much for the reply and explanation.
How do you like the 73? Don't be put off by my comment, a lot of people really really love it
Any time, happy to help!
You know, I haven't cracked it yet. I went in blind for the 73 based on early reviews between the two. But, I bought a sample of the 92 instead of a full bottle. Unfortunately, I didn't pay attention to the notes when I tried it. I recall enjoying it, but somehow didn't spring for a full bottle. Now I wished I'd paid more attention to it. I'll crack the 73 soon though after I empty a few opened bottles. Your comments weren't outputting. They were instead encouraging. I just hope the 73 lives up to my anticipation."

Scotch review #227

*************

**Caol Ila 10 Feis Ile 2018, refill Bourbon hogshead and rejuvenated sherry Butts, 58.2%**

**Nose:** Wow, what a fantastic Islay nose. Huge briny peat that is clean and crystal clear but monstrously huge and thick, caramel, vanilla char, toasted wood, bright crisp citrus, well integrated tart fruit sweetness, sweet dessert pastry malt, smooth barrel char. Peaty and rich with a bright sweetness

**Taste:** Explodes on the palate, so much flavor here. Bright caramel and cake icing, enormous blast of sweet peat that is so bold and clean, a little more gritty earthy fruit emerges but it stays balanced with the huge peat and sweet sugary dessert notes. Vanilla, sugary caramel oak, sweet char, toasted wood, huge briny peat. It all balances in a way that doesn't sacrifice the enormous mouthfeel. 

**Finish:** Long finish of crisp clean peat, sweet sugary icing and dessert notes that slowly darken into caramel, vanilla oak and gritty peaty barrel char. The sugary sweet charred peat lingers for such a long time

**************

I love Caol Ila, it's often just a no-nonsense amazing peaty Islay. And this is easily one of the best Caol Ila's I've ever had. Bright and spirity, thick and peaty, lots of sugary dessert sweetness. Sherry influence is minimal and I think it mostly lends a slight supportive role of richer fruit sweetness. Actually the peat is the real star of the show here, it emerges so bold and clean that everything else is playing a supportive role. Just fantastic

Great review! This is a really good one. I bought a bottle of this at the distillery in July 2018. I wasn't even planning on buying a Caol Ila‚ÄîI already needed to buy an extra suitcase‚Äîbut when I tasted this one I bought it on the spot.
thats really interesting, I would have thought a 10 year would taste pretty standard but it goes to show how much barrel selection matters and that OB special editions can be exceptional because of that
Oh man, this sounds phenomenal! Thanks for the review!

Wow what a treat! Thanks for sharing this one.

Hey, you‚Äôre pushing 500 reviews! Do you have one ready to go?
Daaaaaaamn, very nice!
Great review.  This sounds awesome and with my experience with Diageo SR bottles I absolutely believe this would nail a 9 or 90.  When Diageo's blenders want to show off, they can absolutely kill it.
Thanks! And wow, I'm jealous now. Jealous that you have this bottle and jealous that you got it ON frickin Islay
Absolutely, barrel selection and blending is an art
Yeah, goddamn, there's no way I'm finding this in Charlotte. Even in South Cackalacka's wild west liquor scene it's probably a no-show.
Sure thing, thanks for reading! It was fun.

World Whisky review #22

****************

**Teeling 13 Single Cask, ex-Bourbon and chestnut finish, 55.1%**

**Nose:** A really nice rich woody nose. Freshly toasted oak, big sweet woodiness, chocolate, thick sweet caramel, vanilla, wood spice, smooth caramel cereal notes, sweet grain, woody cherry, vanilla char. Chocolatey smooth and caramel-y, so nice

**Taste:** Like the nose, it's rich and woody and sweet. Thick caramel wood, rich toasted oak, vanilla, tons of sweet grain notes, smooth malt, chocolate, sweet char. Background wood spice. Tannic and mildly bitter notes slowly emerge but in a very nice and balanced way, adds to the woody rich complexity. Vanilla, cocoa, mild tannic wood, smooth caramel. Never feels like a dry oak bomb, it stays rich and luscious and sweet with a really nice mouthfeel

**Finish:** Sweet bitter chocolate, vanilla, sweet woody caramel, gentle wood spice, a sweet chocolatey and vanilla char. Sweet and toasted, really nice finish to this

*************

My first Teeling, and I really love it. Wood influence is really interesting and unique, so delicious. It's a heavy and complex wood but stays extremely well balanced, never feels dry or bitter or overwhelming. Lots of sweetness and caramel and smooth cereal that all melds thickly together. Great flavor and mouthfeel. Considering the heavy wood I'm not sure if this is even a good example of Teeling, but so far I'm impressed

Glad you liked it. I haven‚Äôt had enough Teeling to know if it‚Äôs typical either, but it‚Äôs a fun one. First sip was weird, just because chestnut is such a strong flavor, but now I think it‚Äôs great.
I‚Äôve not found the three Chestnut finished spirits I‚Äôve had to be subtle, the Chestnut is pretty full throttle, but it‚Äôs always a really pleasing flavor. Sounds like you had a similar experience.
Thanks for the review.  This is where Irish gets interesting and something I'd be hard pressed to pass up if the chance arose.
Yeah that's a good way to put it. What I was wondering, is this virgin chestnut? Like freshly toasted, virgin wood? U can almost believe it is with the flavor here. I guess the bottle doesn't say much about it
I'm not usually a big fan of Irish Whiskey, but this might be the best one I've had
That‚Äôs a good question, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever heard anyone specifically say, so I‚Äôve always assumed it is, considering how few barrels there are of it out there."

American Whiskey reviews ‚Äã#208 & 209


**************


**Russell's Reserve Single Barrel, r/Bourbon pick ""Fruit Stand,"" 55%**

**Nose:** Musty wood, vanilla, metallic caramel, mellow minty spice, light green apple, chocolatey toasted oak. Nice woody and musty nose, I like when RR's are like this

**Taste:** Chocolatey oak, wood spice, smooth woody caramel and corn, green apple, dark cherry, clean toasted wood and vanilla, mildly herbal and funky. Very complex, lots of interesting flavors that flow and evolve and balance together very nicely. But still so oaky and Bourbony in that effortless Wild Turkey way

**Finish:** Some sweet cherry and mild dark spice, settles into smooth caramel, sweet toasted oak and vanilla. A really nice oaky sweet finish

* A great pick, it evolves a lot over the course of drinking it. Complex and delicious. Going by the name it's not as fruity to me as I expected. A lot of classic chocolatey and musty Wild Turkey oak here with some really unique and interesting flavors that balance out very well

*****************

**Russell's Reserve Single Barrel, r/Bourbon pick ""Dessert Parlor,"" 55%**

**Nose:** Maple, butterscotch, syrupy cherry, mint, herbal spice, sweet vanilla, sweet toasted oak. Nice sweet butterscotchy wood notes with tingly spice, I really love it

**Taste:** Maple, smooth sweet toasted wood, syrupy cherry, sweet corn, vanilla, mellow herbal spice, deliciously toasted oak. Sweet syrupy mouthfeel with really nice smooth oak notes. Very balanced with effortlessly delicious flavor

**Finish:** Big warm spice embrace, slowly mellows into butterscotch and sweet toasted oak, vanilla and sweet woody cherry, lingering sweet spice. What a long and delicious finish

* This name makes more sense to me. It's sweet and desserty but not in the way I was expecting. Rich maple and butterscotch and sweet toasted wood, this one really speaks to me. The clean toasted oak and minty/herbal notes balance it all beautifully. Rich mouthfeel. Beautiful stuff

*************


These are both delicious. I really didn't feel strongly about a favorite at first, they are both just so good. But over the course of drinking them, Dessert Parlor slowly took the lead. I usually prefer the oaky profile of something like Fruit Stand, but the flavors on Dessert Parlor just really clicked for me. I think it has a little bit of a richer mouthfeel too which helped a lot. I am thrilled to have tried these though and am happy to drink them both. Great job to everyone involved here.

I like really spicy food, so I can understand how that development might happen, but ya, all I‚Äôm getting is ethyl alcohol of the whiskey variety lol. Some of the smells come through but once I taste it it‚Äôs gone
This is the way
I‚Äôd recommend pouring your glass and then letting the bourbon rest for 30 min before drinking. It‚Äôll help some of the ethanol vapors dissipate and might help you get some of the scents/flavors
I think that helped. How wrong is it to throw in a couple ice cubes?
No problemo.  If you want to get more out of the tasting, first take a tiny sip, keep it on your tongue, and notice how the flavor changes as saliva dilutes the sip.  Then, add one ice cube.  Take tiny sips as it melts noting the change in flavors.  Then add a second cube, noting the changes as it melts.  

Developing tasting sensitivity and tolerance is a gradual process."
"Review #494: WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel K&L Wine, 57%",,https://i.redd.it/jsqfqap8grq61.jpg,"American Whiskey review #207

***************

**WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel, K&L pick, 113.9/57%**

**Nose:** Sweet peppery and spicy Rye, toffee, butterscotch, vanilla icing, sweet mint, bright clean Rye, herbal dill, sweet vanilla toasted wood. It's bright and sharp and clean but so thickly balanced at the same time. Tons of bold sweet Rye character, such an amazing nose

**Taste:** Sweet and creamy with a big blast of delicious rye spice. Bright herbal Rye, sweet vanilla icing, huge clean blast of bright peppery and minty spice, hot cherry, clove, sweet creamy butterscotch. Big Rye spice here, but it stays super sweet and thick and balanced for how lively it is. Excellent stuff, everything I look for in a bright and spicy Rye

**Finish:** Long thick and spicy finish. Huge clean rye spice, sugary vanilla, buttercream, sweet and minty. The tingling and minty Rye spice lingers for ages, it's so clean and sweet. Beautiful finish

******

Wow what an excellent Rye. These WhistlePigs can knock it out of the park sometimes, and this one is a great example. It is so hard to find any regularly available Rye that can do what this stuff does. Fierce and uncompromising Rye flavor that is well aged and ridiculously good. This one is very sweet, with lots of sugary grain sweetness and creamy barrel notes. At the same time it has tons of huge bold Rye spice to go along with it and it all balances together in a massive and lively way. These are almost always great but this is a special one

Wow interesting. How much did you pay? I see this sitting on the shelf all the time where I am, but I‚Äôve never tried any of the whistle pig stuff
Is this one of the 17.9 Y.O. barrels that dropped this week?
u/buckydean what about that ABV though? 57%? They rounded up? üòâ

Nice review, as always!
Mighty fancy looking bottle of Alberta Premium right there...
Overpriced Canadian rye. Actually think my biggest gripe with WP is how inconsistent their barrels are
I like Buffalo trace better.  WP is good but overpriced.
I have a store pick of this and it's fantastic.  I got a lot of orange and honey suckle notes from my bottle.
I had this a few years ago but would not purchase it again for the price point.
Hell yeah! Love to see Whistle Pig getting its due. 

""Whistle Pig overpriced"" seems to be one of the major reddit groupthinks here, but they make some seriously good rye whiskey!!! 

Some folks want to buy three bottles bulleit, some folks want to buy one bottle of this. To each their own!
I love the single barrel straight rye. Tried for the first time two weeks ago. Instant favorite.
Very mouth-watering tasting notes. Quite a contrast to some of the recent bottlings of these 10yr CS WPs. I hope they continue to release ones like this. Thanks for the review.
How would you compare this to their standard 10 yr?
How did you beat all the bots that snap up everything on the K&L website?
Just picked up a 120.6 proof store pick today aged 10 years & 10 months. I really enjoy Whistlepig. All this hate just because it‚Äôs Canadian rye? Who cares, it‚Äôs delicious!
WP is my favorite whiskey so far. Just for consistency alone! I'll be on the lookout for this one!
It might be the standard 50% WhistlePig 10 Rye that you are seeing. It's a great Rye but tends to be a little overpriced. If you can find it closer to $50-$60 it's good stuff. 

This one I reviewed is a store select single barrel, bottled at barrel proof. They are around $80-$90 but recently took a price jump closer to $100
If you like mgp rye then the whistle pig 10 or SiB is a buy.  They are a little pricier then they should be imo but they are definitely delicious.
My buddy grabbed one of those for me, I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs something close to how this one tastes!
No, this one is a few years old. From 2019
Yes! I was going to see if anybody noticed haha. As you already know, it bugs me more than it probably should that they rounded off the ABV but not the Proof so now they don't match. And thanks!
Except Alberta Premiums own offering is aged half the time of this
I've been through a lot of these, probably dozens at this point from all across the country. And I find it to be consistently one of my favorite bottles. I've had maybe just a few poor ones, and they still weren't completely horrible. That sucks if you have come across bad ones though. Maybe it's just not your style
To each their own! I'm a big fan of Rye and there isn't much out there with a 100% Rye mashbill that can satisfy the Rye craving like this stuff does. It was love at first sip and I still really love the stuff
Yeah these are almost always fantastic in my experience. Glad you're enjoying yours so much too!
Yeah, I hear that sometimes and it's fair. Everyone's tastes are different. I personally can't get enough of it. Consider it a win for your wallet
I have this WP 10yr and it's very good but I like my Bulleit for everyday sipping as well. Best of both worlds.
Whistle Pig isn't an MGP... It's a Canadian Rye
Same! I was asking because I swooped one yesterday and am expecting it any minute!
Cracked one of the new ones last night, incredible stuff. Wish I grabbed two.
Wouldn't know, don't drink it.... Too many memories of poor quality and it's Canadian
Very true, it's by no means bad or lacking and people should try it.
Whistle pig used to have mgp barrels. They got rid of any mgp stock they had in 2019 around the same time they changed the label design
I got an ~18yr bottle In MI and it is just fantastic. So well balanced and complex.
Awesome, thanks for the sneak peek!
I know... I miss my MGP WP.... I don't like Alberta Premium, so I can't bring myself to buy a bottle of this yet... Though I've heard the more expensive bottles of Alberta Premium are quite good ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
this label is old, decent chance it's MGP especially reading the profile. i've tried alberta/mgp side by side they're totally different
Well yeah, they're different whiskies"

***********

**The Senator Rye 6 year (MGP), Hi-Time single barrel, 58.06%**

**Nose:** Sweet brown sugar and toffee, toasted oak, vanilla, strong layer of herbal and minty Rye, mild black liquorice and root beer, chocolate cherry. Sugary sweet and caramelized, nice oak and thick balanced Rye

**Taste:** Sweet and sugary with big Rye flavor, caramel, bright zingy Rye spice and hot cherry, cinnamon, rich brown sugar, mint, evenly toasted oak, sweet vanilla icing, delicious spice heat. Not as oaky as the nose, but it comes together really well in a sweet and brash way. Lots of big lively Rye flavor which is always a plus for me as a total Rye fiend

**Finish:** Big blast of brash Rye spice and bright sugary-sweet brown sugar, settles into richer caramel, lightly toasted oak and minty Rye. Lingering sweet minty and toasted Rye spice

********************

A delicious MGP Rye, really digging this right now. It's in the sweet spot for an MGP where it is young enough to retain a lot of strong Rye character but also has some nice barrel influence that brings it all together and (somewhat) balances it out. It leans a little more on the youthful and brash side but that's fine by me. More of a lightly toasted and sweet oakiness of caramel and brown sugar. It was too hot and messy when I first opened it, but after giving it some time it has come around very nicely

These are fantastic bottles. I‚Äôm friends with the guy who owns this brand. He is a co-founder of Redemption Rye, sold that for a fortune, and now his job consists of hunting down honey barrels for his small-batch bottlings like this. He‚Äôs an old-school whiskey slinger and The Senator is one of his best creations.
I‚Äôve had my eye on one of these. Sounds like it‚Äôs worth picking up!
Big review. Many words. Bird approved.
Really need to open mine up, I don't have SiB/store pick but I have both the 2019 & 2020.

Appreciate the review, look forward to trying them.
Been looking at grabbing the high time pick myself, I think this just solidified the decision.
Snagged a store pick of The Senator. Really enjoy it.
Hi, neighbor! I just got this exact same bottle last week. Thanks for the review, looking forward to opening mine!
How are HiTime picks? I always shop there but haven‚Äôt tried any of the barrel picks
I‚Äôve been looking at grabbing either the standard Senator or a store pick 8 year old Presidential Dram rye. Was wondering if you think 2 more years and a little lower proof justify the $95 price tag though for the Dram?
What's the $damage?
Oh neat! Redemption and Senator have both been a couple of my favorites when it comes to more modern barrel proof bottlings of MGP Rye. I'm a big fan of that 95% mashbill
It's the only barrel select one of these I've had so I can't speak for others, but I also love the standard 6 year Senator so they have a good track record so far
Thanks?
I have the 56.05% Senator, it's fantastic. I think that might be the 2019? A step up from this one I think but I haven't done it sbs to really compare
Cool, hope you like it!
Howdy fellow Californian! Hope you enjoy it
Yes, I do think the higher price might be worth the extra age. 8yr MGP Rye is getting into a magical age for the stuff. Especially depending on the store. If it's a store you know has done good picks in the past it might be really great
Oh yeah forgot to put that in the review. Price was about $70, which is great for a decently aged MGP Rye
Cool! If you like those kind of MGP whiskeys (and who doesn't?), check out another brand the guy does, called Tumblin Dice. Fantastic brand with some more killer juice that this dude has tracked down.
You thought the standard was better than the single barrel? I've been nursing my bottle because I can't find it at all in NJ. Its a throwback to bright mgp ryes that don't seem to exist anymore.
Are there barrel proof versions of Tumbling Dice? I've never seen any
Yes, there are barrel proof versions available.
The maroon/gold label Tumblin Dice is a barrel proof 5 year old MGP that can be found local to me for around $40-$50 and is delicious.  I've been lucky to also find an 11 year Tumblin which is also fantastic (black label).  Hell, even their standard navy/silver label high rye bourbon is tasty for $30.

**Domaine de Bertruc 1988 29 year, Darroze Unique Collection, 50%**

**Nose:** Smooth dark toasted oak, chocolatey char, leather, clove spice, mahogany wood, dark prune and raisin, burnt grape, sweet vanilla, some sweeter cherry. Heavy wood that stays very balanced with very nice rich fruits.

**Taste:** Sweet candy grape and chocolate, root beer char, gentle exotic spice, chocolate covered cherry, leather, rich smooth toasted wood, mild tannic bite, dark char, sweet vanilla. Tons of rich and interesting oak notes here with just enough warm grape sweetness to not feel overly oaked. And it all comes together so effortlessly. Rich and smooth and complex, beautiful stuff 

**Finish:** Huge finish of sweet vanilla, rich chocolatey smooth toasted wood, layers of gentle wood spice, root beer char, minty grape. Lingering sweet vanilla and smooth candy grape. Excellent finish, just mouthwateringly good

********

A fantastic Armagnac. I've had this bottle for quite some time, it has been with me through much of my Armagnac journey. Somehow, I didn't care for it at first. It seemed too dry and boringly woody. But I can't believe how much I've come around on it. Lots of very complex and smooth wood notes with just enough sweet grape and fruits to perfectly balance out all the wood. It all comes together so perfectly. I think in my earlier Armagnac days it wasn't enough of a big punchy fruit/oak bomb to appeal to me. I am really digging it tonight though

Hey, I know that monkey! This sounds really good. Ok, hate to impose on you but I'm ready to start my armagnac journey but not sure where to start. You mentioned a really good bottle with Fine Drams but I'll need to start with local sources. Here is a link to Binny's armagnac. See anything that sounds good? Up to $200, thx
https://www.binnys.com/search?q=armagnac
That Lagavulin sounded really good over on r/scotch
I can only imagine how awful it must've been to have this be one of your early armagnac experiences ;)

Curious if they specify the grape varietals used? I've found that old Ugni Blanc takes some time to become familiar with, especially when coming from the whisky world. Whereas folle blanche is generally more accessible because it's more fruit forward even as it tacks on the age.
Hey dude! So I'm gonna sound like a broken record, but the FineDrams bottle really is your best bet. It's cheaper and probably better than anything at Binny's. I'm showing $113 shipped for it right now. This is the one: https://www.finedrams.com/grosperrin-1996-bas-armagnac-aficionados-x-fine-drams.html 

If you really can't get anything shipped right now, I understand. I'm not really familiar with any of the more premium bottles they have in the $150 range, so I wouldn't take the chance. I'd say just start simple with the L'Encantada XO: https://www.binnys.com/spirits/brandy/lencantada-bas-armagnac-xo-969903

It's a blend of several different casks with some really decent age, in the 20-30 year range I believe. I had 1.0 and really liked it, Binny's probably has 2.0. It's cask strength but it's a naturally low cask strength of about 44%. Here's my review of 1.0: https://www.reddit.com/r/Armagnac/comments/m5ropz/reviews_484485_lencantada_xo_and_ravignan_1985_33/
Hey, thanks for the in depth reply. Agreed, it'll be Fine Drams. That's a great price. I've yet to order from them but they seem solid and great selections. I'll cut the shipping per bottle down by getting one of their Signatory Ben Nevis's.

Have you had a taste of SCN Ben Nevis 6 year old or the Cardhu 11 year old, 2020 cs? Just curious.
No, but I hear good things about those Diageo special Release bottles at cask strength. Also, t8ke just announced a new r/Scotch pick. It will be available on FineDrams: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/mnlxwu/rscotch_youre_bastards_but_i_love_you_announcing/

If you haven't had ballechin it's really good stuff. Heavily peated 

FineDrams is fantastic. Cheap, super fast shipping. I've used them a lot

EDIT: I really think you'll be happy with the grosperrin 96 afish pick. It's fantastic stuff. I have a backup bottle and I'm still gonna buy more
A new r/Scotch pick, sounds good, thanks for the info."

**Maker's Mark Wood Finishing Series 2020, SE4 x PR5, 55.4%**

**Nose:** Creamy caramel, sweet toasted wood notes, vanilla char, dessert cherry, a strong layer of cool balanced spice, richly toasted oak. Nice rich oak and spice, balanced with great dessert sweetness. Wow delicious nose

**Taste:** Sweet and pleasant like the nose, but it arrives with much more of a bang. Big blast of sweet corn and bright complex spice, sweet creamy caramel, hot bold cherry, creamy vanilla, lots of rich toasted oak, brash bourbony spice kick. Big delicious oaky Bourbon flavor, creamy and sweet but with a very healthy spice kick. It all balances together in a tasty and complex way. Delicious and so much fun

**Finish:** Peaks bright and hot with woody caramel, hot zingy cherry and sweet exotic spice, slowly darkens and richens into toffee, vanilla and sweet sweet barrel char. Dark and sweet finish, delicious til the very end. Lingering vanilla and sweet char

******

I'm not usually a big fan of Maker's Mark but damn this is great stuff. It's decadently sweet, but it's balanced by tons of rich toasted oak notes and delicious lively spice. It's a bit hot, but it manages to be a fun Bourbony kick and spice kind of heat. It's a lot of fun to drink and has just been getting better every time I pour it. I really enjoyed the 2019 as well, so it's looking like these are turning out to be a pretty safe bet for my Wheater cravings

I love this stuff and luckily got a couple bottles. You nailed it on that decadent nose. 

Fae-01 dropped here yesterday and I‚Äôm excited for it
I‚Äôm not really a fan of standard makers. Does this have the makers profile but just tastier? Or does it not even taste like the standard at all? I‚Äôm really interested in their LE‚Äôs but not sure if I‚Äôd like them so I pass.
I always tell people this stuff tastes like a Maker‚Äôs Manhattan because of the bold cherry taste.
I was sent this as a blind sample and thought it was fantastic. I rated it an 8.3 before it was revealed to me. I fully agree with your review
Never cared much for regular makers but this stuff is üî•üî•üî•
Nice. Been waiting for it to drop in LA. Made a few calls earlier this week but nothing in stock yet. Where are you located?
I'm not a big fan of Maker's other stuff either, so I know what you mean. I was pleasantly surprised with how much I liked this stuff. But it's hard to compare a barrel proof bottle like this to the standard 45% Maker's. It's similar but different. It's more creamier and sweet, much richer oak, a lot more spice. It's bigger and better
Denver. I bet it‚Äôll be there by next week
My MM journey. Not a regular MM fan either but I love wheaters and really wanted to like MM. 
Tried MM46...game changer. Love it. Tried MM cask strength...one and done as I didn‚Äôt care for it.  46CS was regular 46 on steroids while the Wood Finishing Series (RC6; SE4xPR5; FAE-01) took the MM experience to a deliciously new level. 

For all those regular MM haters out there, at least give the LE Wood Finishing Series a try. That product line is a game changer. ü•É"

Bourbon Reviews #203 and 204

*********

**Mystery Sample 1**

**Nose:** Sweet cherry, sweet peppery spice, corn, caramel, light butterscotch, fruits, stale-ish toasted wood and some background corn funk. Nice nose, but it definitely feels a little washed out and hot compared to 2

**Taste:** Sweet creamy caramel, light cherry fruits, some nice butterscotch,nice sweet spice, stale wood, slight funk. It's a pleasant sipper,

**Finish:** Tart fruits and sweet spice, toasted wood, creamy sweetness. With how rough around the edges this has been I was worried it might be a hot mess on the finish but it's actually a pretty nice sweet finish

**5/10**

************

**Mystery Sample 2**

**Nose:** Nose is richer and just flat out better than sample 1 by a mile. Big thick butterscotch and maple syrup, rich and decadent, vanilla, deliciously sweet toasted wood, sticky sweet caramel. Sweet nose but in a thick and creamy way, really great

**Taste:** Wow, like the nose it's hands down on a higher level than sample 1. Thick sweet cherry syrup and rich caramel, creamy butterscotch, sweet balanced spice, cherry toasted wood, vanilla. Has a nice syrupy mouthfeel, not quite thick and viscous but very nice for 45%. Super drinkable

**Finish:** Building warm sweet spice, toasted wood, tart black cherry, corn sweetness, vanilla. Warm and thick and sweet

**7/10**

***********

No comparison between these, there's no question that 2 is my favorite. It soundly beats 1 in pretty much every way. It's richer, better flavor and mouthfeel. More balanced yet bigger. I don't want to hate on 1 too much though, it's still a very pleasant and sippable Scotch. It's just a little rough around the edges compared to 2.

**Reveal:**

Sample 1: >!Maker's Mark 2021, 45%!<

Sample 2: >!Maker's Mark 1992, 45%!<

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** I don't know if doing this blind was totally necessary haha. Sample 2(the 1992) immediately stood out as the superior of the two, I would have been surprised(but happy) if it turned out being the modern version. Color was even noticeably darker on the 1992. 2021 is still good stuff, I actually enjoyed it much more than I remember. But drank next to the 1992 sample it felt washed out and hot, and a little too young and funky. It's so sad that a delicious well aged 45% sipper like this classic Maker's Mark seems to be a thing of the past. Really happy to have gotten the chance to try some

I'm so curious about why they taste different, maybe just younger?
Your results are exactly as I expected from reading the title alone. Thanks for sharing this!
This matches my own experience.  The 90's 90 proof stuff is just way better.
I think the biggest factor here is the barrel (and probably aging time to an extent). Distilling methods and precision could have only gotten better in 30 years. 

Barrel staves have gotten thinner due to supply and efficiency/cost reduction. Thinner staves mean a thinner char layer, thus less robust flavor and influence on the whiskey. One of the experts on a distillery zoom this year made this point, but cannot for the life of me recall who.
I agree that 1990s MM is really good. Another possibility for the difference is the change from wooden to stainless steel fermenters, although I think the main difference is the age of the product.
Makers mark is a distillery I really wish would do an age stated version. I've always wondered what their stuff would taste like at around 9-12 years.
That's my guess. 1992 had richer barrel notes of vanilla and caramel and toasted wood, I think it's probably just older stuff they were using back then. The 2021 felt more youthful, lighter notes, hotter, more corn funk
Sure thing, thanks for reading and glad you enjoyed it! You are totally right. These are exactly the kind of results I would have expected. And that's why I try to do stuff like this blind, to remove that very bias. But there's just no denying the quality of this older stuff sometimes
Do you have a source for that? There's lots of talk about the quality of the wood being better back then, older and larger trees being used etc, but I've never heard of staves being thinner. I would think barrel specs havent changed much when strength and sealing of the liquid is such a major issue. Unless you're talking about the exotic staves that MM adds inside the barrel for extra flavor
Yeah same. Their Bourbon has very nice flavor, it's just a little brash and rough. This 1992 confirmed for me that they are capable of making much better stuff
It would make sense. I remember a few years ago (hmm, I guess it was 2013) a story about Maker's mark toying with the idea of watering down their stuff more to try and meet the spike in demand. The public outcry against the idea was strong enough to keep them from doing it, but it wouldn't surprise me if they resorted to just aging it less so they could increase production. I think demand for bourbon has only increased since then, too.

I can't imagine the challenge of forecasting supply/demand for a mass producing a product that literally takes years to make.
In the early 90‚Äôs I would wager that MM (and most whiskey producers) had a lots of older barrels that weren‚Äôt bottled as the demand just wasn‚Äôt these. 
Maybe a reason that Knob Creek came out of the gate with 9 year old, 100 proof that I was immediately attracted to,
I appreciate you tasting blind, that‚Äôs the only way!
Wish i could recall the exact source, could have been Greg Metze, Tripp Stimson, or Jane Bowie talking about how over time, cooperages have cut the staves thinner, to nearly the thinnest possible point before leakage and structural failure becomes a serious concern. Honestly, it was an authoritative source, but i can't remember exactly who."

Scotch review #226

*****

**Blair Athol 2009 10 year, SMWS 68.34 ""Roasty-Toasty-Tasty,"" re-charred hogshead, 59.6%%**

**Nose:** Graham cracker, toffee, fun fruits, thick milk chocolate, brine, some tasty funk, wood spice, rich vanilla pudding. Delicious nose, I'm pretty sure we're dealing with a woody and chocolatey Scotch

**Taste:** Flavor ramps up on the palate, has much more punch compared to the smooth nose. Toffee and bold peppery spice, rich toasted wood, chocolate, caramel malt, light funk, gritty barrel char and vanilla. Smooth rich chocolatey flavor with a healthy kick of hot spice, delicious

**Finish:** Spice blast that slowly settles into lots of chocolate and gritty barrel char, dark toasted wood, vanilla cream. So much sweet chocolatey wood with no tannic or bitter notes to be found

* I was going back and forth between Bourbon and Scotch on this. But in the end I'm really thinking it's an especially woody and chocolatey Scotch, and it's very well executed. Big flavor with lots of smooth rich wood and a nice spice kick. It's so smooth in fact that I was wondering if it is 46%, but I'm pretty sure it drinks a little too richly flavored and must be higher. My first instinct was Kilkerran, I'm really feeling Campbeltown on this. Gonna say Springbank though. It reminds me a lot of the 10 year. I think it's higher abv though, solidly mid 50's and first fill Bourbon.

Score: **8**

**********

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** Feel pretty good about this guess all in all. The recharred Bourbon barrel is different but explains all the heavy wood notes. Very interesting, it seems to give it all the smooth vanilla and chocolatey wood flavor but without anything too brash or bitter. Tasty stuff. If it reminds me of Kilkerran and Springbnak that's a win in my book. [Link to bottle](https://www.smwsa.com/products/cask-no-68-34)

Great review. This one sounds great. I'm almost tempted to join SMWS for access to some of these. Any thoughts?
Great review and great guess! This sounds really delicious.
Hey dude, always good to see you pop into my reviews haha. SMSW prices almost make it not worth it to me honestly, they are pretty pricey. But then again they seem to be great quality, I have rarely had any bad ones. Not sure if u/b1uepenguin is a member, maybe he could tell you more
Hey, thanks to u/buckydean for the tag.  I do have a membership, though I rarely pick up bottles for myself.  I've just copy-pasted a recent response to a similar question about whether SMWS was worth joining--

> Depends.  If you really want to try more single cask bottles from different distilleries, especially less common ones, then it can be great-- especially if you live in a place where interesting bottles and independent bottler products are just not available in the shop. If you do live in a place with plenty of single cask selections and/or IBs, then you might not get quite the same mileage out of it.

>I reckon it is also a better value if you are able to share bottles with friends. That way you can try more things and if you want to gamble on a more expensive bottle you're spreading around the risk if you don't really care for it. Most of the reviews I've posted have been the result of doing tastings with a local club. It took me about a year before I bothered getting a bottle just for myself and it definitely helped once I had a good idea what sort of bottles I rated highest from the Society.

>There is a lot more value to be found if you are in a city or location where the Society does tastings and events. While none of those have been happening for over a year, those were a great chance to try bottles and meet people.
Hey, always really good reviews and nice reads. That Blair Athol sounds really good and not found anywhere else. 
Yea, I've thought about joining SMSW many times over the years but always hold back. They do have a nice selection of harder to find distilleries and now with prices creeping up all over, their pricing doesn't seem too bad. Locally, I buy from Binnys. Recently though, the last couple of years, they've been cutting back on IB's and the less popular distilleries. They still have a good selection but limited.  I'm glad that u/bluepenguin weighed in ( thank you bluepenguin). Maybe he can tell me more about shipping and any extra costs that are added on the the purchase of say, a $100 bottle.  I've been hearing that the shipping for SMWS bottles is quite high and they charge taxes..... 
I think maybe I'll just stick with ordering online, Finedrams, Dramtime and Whiskyworld. That said, I've seen some nice offerings from SMWS. Ok, I'm on the fence and I need more whisky money ; ) .  Cheers."

World Whisky review #21

*****

**Kavalan (NAS), Scotch Malt Whisky Society 139.6 ""Viscimetric Funk,"" 1st fill Port Barrique, 58.9% (done blind)**

**Nose:** Right off the bat I'm thinking Bourbon here. It's sweet and mellow with some musty wood, vanilla, strong sweetness, menthol, big spice that is somewhat brash but stays well balanced, light toasted wood. With some air I'm thinking Rye now

**Taste:** Brash cherry syrup and cola, big blast of clean brash spice, floral, peppery, nutty caramel, evenly toasted wood. It's a pretty heavy spice dose, I'm thinking Rye still. Stays balanced though, the spice rides along nicely and doesn't overwhelm the other flavors.

**Finish:**Syrupy sweet cherry and lots of big dramatic Rye spice that builds huge then rides out for a long time with nutty caramel and toasted wood. Big delicious finish 

* It's a decent sipper, whatever it is it has a lot of spice character. Never feels too hot, just a very pervasive menthol and even spice which makes me think it's Rye. Nothing is jumping out at me as far as a guess. I'm not thinking Bourbon at all like I initially was, if anything it could be a spicy Scotch. Not super hot, maybe low 50's.

Score: **7/10**

*****

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** wtf. I don't think I've even had Kavalan before, so I'm not familiar enough with their style to know just how embarrassed I should be. The Port is a real surprise. Even sipping on a little that I saved, I don't get any heavy Port or wine type notes. The malt I can see though. Sipping on it I still get lots of spice and malt and still feel ok about my Rye guess haha

This one is absolute beauty. It goes toe to toe with Kavalan Sherry finished expressions.
Your use of the word ‚Äòbrash‚Äô is... well... brash.
Ha I used the word quite a bit here, you might be right. I edited one out. I do that sometimes in my reviews, beat a certain word to death"
"Review #486: Bruichladdich ""Whisky Cask Owners Club"" 2010 10 year, Rivesaltes Hogshead 64%",,https://i.redd.it/3rawqkt6man61.jpg,"Courtesy of @Martin2D

Scotch Review #225

*****

**Bruichladdich 2010 10 year, ""Whisky Cask Owner's Club,"" Rivesaltes Hogshead, 64%**

**Nose:** Thick luscious caramel, very healthy wine funk, robust malt, big tart berry and black cherry fruits mixed with fudgy chocolate, toffee, clean toasted wood, vanilla, heavy but balanced spice. Big dramatic and complex nose

**Taste:** Thick and measured flavor, not a big blast of heat at all with the 64%. Thick luscious caramel with lots of wine funk, brooding dark tart fruits, black cherry, berry, clean metallic caramel, bitter chocolate, lots of rich wood, vanilla, thick caramel malt, dark well controlled spice. Big lumbering flavor, it's mostly heavy and funky and rich but still quite malty and sweet

**Finish:** Building spice, big toffee and sweet wine funk, chocolate strawberry, metallic funky caramel, lingering sweet toasted wood and spice. Very complex finish

*****

This is good stuff, but you better be ready for some heavy and funky wine. It's actually a very interesting chance to explore some of Bruichladdich's wine influence. Bruichladdich commonly uses lots of Rivesaltes wine casks in their standard Laddie bottlings, so it's a lot of fun to see the full blown cask influence on it's own here. My main take away is lots of funk. I'm convinced that these Rivesaltes casks are where a lot of the signature Laddie funk comes from, but in their standard bottling they blend it down and temper it with lots of young raw and grassy malt. This one never feels overly sweet or wine'y though. It's a beast of a Scotch, but maybe not as big of a beast as you would think at 64%. It delivers tons of flavor and never gets too hot.

I tried a full Rivesaltes matured Bruichladdich last night and you are so right about that funk!

It wasn‚Äôt amazing but I‚Äôve never tasted anything like it so I might still try to buy a full bottle.
Thanks for this review! i'm eyeing another rivesaltes private cask at 11yo and 64.7% for 150 euros and this review does help paint a picture. seems exactly like what i'd like."
Reviews #484/485: L'Encantada XO and Ravignan 1985 33 year (side-by-side),,https://i.redd.it/5rlhv9rml8n61.jpg,"Some info on these: The L'Encantada XO is a blend of Pibous 1989, Pibous 1987, Cassou 1994, and Bellair 1997, presented at cask strength. The Ravignan is single vintage made with a blend of ""all 4 main Amagnac grapes."" I was advised that I should do these two specific yaks side by side, and that sounded good to me. So here we go!

Brandy reviews #34 & 35

**********

**L'Encantada XO Bas-Armagnac, 46.8%**

**Nose:** Sweet, lightly fruity and floral, sticky-sweet caramel, nutty toasted pecan, pleasantly sweet pop of grape and cherry, vanilla, toasted wood, gentle wood spice. On the more delicate and easy side, very balanced and pleasant

**Taste:** Sweet pleasant fruits, balanced floral notes, sweet nutty caramel, sweet toasted wood, mild wood spice, vanilla. Feels like it's very well made if they were going for something agreeable and sweet. Maybe a bit too light and washed out feeling, but fun in an easy drinking kind of way

**Finish:** Wood spice builds with slightly more tart grape and berry notes, a light cherry cola, sweet brash floral and wood notes. The finish is nice but still very light, the mellow little spice kick keeps it from being too boring

****************

**Chateau de Ravignan 1985 33 year, 41%**

**Nose:** Dark caramel, smooth milk chocolate, undertone of dark sweet fruitiness of prune and grape, rich toasted wood, vanilla. Dark and rich in it's light elegant way, effortlessly balanced. Delicious nose

**Taste:** Super cohesive and balanced feel, silky smooth. Smooth milk chocolate, dark gently toasted wood, warm undercurrent of soft grape, caramel, lightly sweet vanilla wood notes. It's light at the low abv but in a smooth and elegant way, still has a very nice oily mouthfeel. Flavor all lands effortlessly right where it needs to be

**Finish:** The smooth elegant flavor rides effortlessly into the finish. Smooth milk chocolate, chocolate strawberry, vanilla, gentle wood spice. Easy and smooth dark richness

****************

* Ravignan is the clear for me here, but the Encantada is nice too. The Encantada XO tastes like it's going for something sweet and accessible and easy drinking, and they did a good job at it. I think it would do well as an introduction to Armagnac for someone not used to drinking spirits neat. But the Ravignan is the real deal, a real yak lovers pour. It's quite light but pulls off a smooth and elegant feel, and it still drinks richer at 41% than the XO does at 46.8%. The color difference between the two in the picture illustrates the basic profile difference pretty well

**Score:**

L'Encantada XO: **6**

Ravignan 1985: **7**

Buffalo Trace Distillery update,,https://i.redd.it/msnhhk3rkam61.jpg,"1.2 BILLION dollar expansion... Holy shit.
So by 2036 george t stagg for all at msrp? Elmer t lee and rock hill farms will overwhelm the shelves by 2031? Weller will go back to the bottom shelf where it sat for years?
I just received this email today, it has some interesting info so thought I would share. There were a few things I left out about awards they've won and a facebook live cocktail event, but this is the nitty gritty info and news that I thought was most interesting.

*****

>Hello to old friends and new,

>We hope this e-mail finds you and your family well.

>We have lots to update since we last wrote, including our continued expansions and visitation to the Distillery since we reopened for tours last July.

>In this update we will tell you about:

>-Distillery Expansion Phase II

>-Warehouse Expansion Update

>-Distillery Visitation

>-Harvesting Corn from our Farm

>-Eagle Rare Life Award Winner

>-Still Making Hand Sanitizer

>-Recent Awards

>-Virtual Experiences

>In order to be email considerate, we have pasted a photo collage of a manageable size and attached the photo collage for those email accounts that prohibit embedded photographs.

>**Distillery Expansion Phase II**

>This past summer we entered Phase II of our $1.2 billion Distillery expansion, which will allow us to continue to make more whiskey. We anticipate this phase to span two years.

>We installed four new fermenters this summer. These fermenter tanks are 93,000 gallons each and join the four new fermenters we added in 2019.

>We are also building another Still House. So far, the concrete pads for the new tanks and the foundation for the building have been poured and we are now entering the early stages of construction, laying underground piping, completing foundation work and preparing to assemble the first tanks.

>A new spent mash drying house is also in the works. We are renovating our long disused 1880s Warehouse B to become our new ‚ÄúDry House‚Äù which allows us to process left over sour mash so that it can sold on to food supply chain companies.

>A new hammer mill, process cooling system and a complete $45.0 million wastewater treatment plant are also part of Phase II, and are currently in the design and preparation stages.

>**Warehouse Expansion Update**

>We are moving right along with the Warehouse expansion taking place on our Whiskey Farm, adjacent to the Distillery. In the spring of 2018, we began filling our first new warehouse, Warehouse AA, and since then have built and filed Warehouses AA through HH.

>This year we are adding three new barrel warehouses of the same size and plan to continue to add future warehouses at a rate of one every four months until further notice.

>Each of these warehouses hold 58,800 barrels or 14.1 million bottles, are seven stories tall and metal clad with insulation.

>We are one of the few distilleries, and the first, to heat our warehouses. Col., E.H. Taylor, Jr. started steam heating the warehouses he built here in the late 1800s, and we have continued that practice. The heating system for the new warehouses on the farm is a patented heating system in the floors with dual zones so temperatures in each warehouse can be managed independently.

>We are excited to share that through rigorous analysis, the new warehouses compared to the warehouses on our main campus are yielding consistent taste profiles for our whiskeys. This is something we have worked very hard to ensure. We test all barrels in the new warehouses every 12 months and run them through a full sensory analysis to compare them to our ‚Äústandard‚Äù for that brand at the part in its aging cycle and also compare them against barrels which have been aging the same amount of time in our more established warehouses on our main campus. As our barrels continue to rest we‚Äôll continue to monitor them and run tests as we do with all of our aging barrels to make sure they are meeting or exceeding brand standards of quality.

>**Distillery Visitation**

>Despite a nearly four-month closure at the onset of the pandemic, and now limiting the number of guests we can welcome to keep our groups small, we are humbled to report strong visitation for 2020, all thanks to the many guests who felt comfortable visiting the Distillery during this time. We closed the Distillery to public visitation in early March following the guidance of health and government officials, reopened July 1st, and welcomed 145,365 visitors throughout 2020, actually growing visitation year-over-year in December.

>We shifted focus when the pandemic struck, utilizing the closure to drive forward with a massive expansion of our Visitor Center and enhance safety and sanitation protocols in order to be able to reopen safely with a comfortable environment for our guests.

>Our sincere thanks goes to the thousands of visitors, from across the country, who have felt confident in our safety protocols and chose to visit Buffalo Trace Distillery since we reopened, it is very much appreciated.

>Our operating hours are 10 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 11:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Sunday. Registrations for the Trace Tour, Old Taylor Tour, Bourbon Barrel Tour and Expansion Tour can be made at https://www.buffalotracedistillery.com/visit-us.html. All tours are complimentary and include a socially distanced tasting. Curbside sales also continue. To place an order visit https://www.buffalotracedistillery.com/shop.html.

>A complete list of safety procedures, along with information about enacted sanitation measures and protective equipment in use can be found here.

>**Harvesting Corn from our Farm**

>This past October we harvested our latest crop of heirloom corn from our farm. Over the summer we grew 18 acres of one of the oldest corn varieties, dating back to 1,000 B.C., called Indian corn.

>Commonly referred to by its nickname ‚ÄúFlint Corn,‚Äù due to its reputation of being ‚Äúhard as flint,‚Äù this type of corn can be consumed by livestock and is often ground to make hominy and polenta. This strain of corn is also often used as a centerpiece on Thanksgiving tables as it is commonly viewed as the symbol of fall and the harvest.

>At harvest, the kernel colors were quite diverse as expected, and rich in traditional fall colors, including white, red, yellow, brown and blue.

>However, the overall yield did not result as hoped and is expected to produce just a few barrels of bourbon. Once harvested, the corn was placed in our grain silo on the farm and will eventually be milled, cooked, distilled and barreled.

>This was the sixth crop of heirloom corn we have grown and harvested on the ‚ÄúWhiskey Farm.‚Äù Over the last five summers, we have grown Boone County White corn, Japonica Striped corn, CF790 Conventional corn, Neon Pink Popcorn and Royal Blue and Hickory Cane White corn.

>Each crop harvested on the farm is being distilled and aged on site to one day become expressions of ‚ÄúSingle Estate‚Äù bourbons. Name, age or price of this future bourbon is still to be determined.

>**Eagle Rare Life Award Winner**

>We are excited to share that the recipient of the 2021 Eagle Rare Life Award is Natalie Guo. Natalie founded Off Their Plate, a non-profit organization that partners with restaurants to help feed their local communities in crisis.

>The honor is a $50,000 recognition and charitable donation for an individual who, like the award‚Äôs namesake bourbon, finds ways to Reach Higher in fulfilling their American Dream. Guo, born in China and immigrated to the U.S. from Sweden as a child, responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by creating a charity that both revives restaurants struggling with quarantine restrictions, and feeds health care workers and community members in need because of the virus.

>She was chosen out of dozens of public nominations and is the 11th recipient of the Eagle Rare Life Award.

>Off Their Plate partners with struggling restaurants owned by women or people of color to make hot meals for healthcare workers or people experiencing hunger. Each $100 donation restores restaurant wages to the local economy while providing 10 meals for those in need.

>Guo‚Äôs creation not only happened in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak, but during her studies at Harvard Medical School. She is no stranger to work, however. She is a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Business School. Along her journey, she has also tutored inner-city children, advised biotech startup companies and worked as a healthcare investor.

>For more information about Off Their Plate or to donate, visit offtheirplate.org.

>**Hand Sanitizer Production**

>It has almost been a year since we began producing hand sanitizer at Buffalo Trace for some of the world‚Äôs largest organizations in healthcare, government, military, retail, distribution, airline, pharmacy, and banking industries. We are continuing this effort, and have now created about 1.1 million gallons on an industrial scale.

>If your business or institution has a need for industrial hand sanitizer, please fill out this form and someone from the distillery will get back to you.

>If you would like to purchase a bottle for yourself, you can do so here.

>**Future Updates**

>We look forward to continuing to bring you periodic updates about our Distillery expansion, Whiskey Farm happenings and much more.

>In the meanwhile, if we can be of any help at all with questions, needs, or wants please just reply to this e-mail and it will be personally answered. If there are topics you would like to hear about from us, please do let us know that too.

>In closing, and on behalf of all the now 592 team members at Buffalo Trace Distillery, thank you for your support of our whiskeys, it is very much appreciated.

>Cheers,

>Mark and Kristie
Can‚Äôt wait to get a CEHT Warehouse B Leftover Sour Mash BiB
Honestly good for them but I couldnt care less about BT. They can hold back stock, hike prices, play whatever games. There are too many other options out there in liqueur in general.

I'm not saying they're not good. Everyone just gets hung up on BT for some reason. I mean....regular old makers is leagues better than weller SR. The new people just think SR is good because it's difficult to get.
I find it disturbing that despite being closed for a third of the year, they still had more visitors than 2019. I stayed home for a year and other folks just went and spread the stuff around while I stayed home, huh?
I was suppose to get Weller Full proof barrel samples last week. The floods are slowing down the process!
Fireball sales already paid for it.
That means less Weller and a price hike I'm sure.
Thought the same thing. Get ready for price hikes.
They can thank Joe Rogan
Dream come true :-)
I have a bunch of Pappy, Weller Antique, Weller 12 year, Elmer T. Lee and dozens of the BTAC that I bought in PA between 2002-2005.  The PALCB even put the Antique on closeout, if you can believe that.  My point is that all these impossible to get bourbons just sat on the shelves before they got ""discovered"".  IMHO, being discovered was the worst thing to happen to bourbon lovers such as myself, but I no longer try to get these brands anymore.
Imagine, a case of Stagg Jr. every batch
But how many tornados did it survive?
Look at this guy with the time to stand in line for 6 hours/disposable money to spend $2000 for a single bottle on the secondary market
I read it as Dec. year over year, meaning comparing the single month of Dec. 19, to the single month of Dec. 20.  I wrote corporate reports for a living, so the verbiage is common to compare YoY growth projections.  

I cancelled my plans for the Bourbon trail last year, and am hopeful that I can pull it off before the end of this year, if things continue to improve with the vax plan.
People were looking to go do whatever was open. Apparently, BT Distillery was open...
Yup
I wonder if it's true or just better counting.  Before you could just roll in and hit the gift shop.  They probably didn't get counted without a tour.  Now EVERYONE that walks in the doors is counted.
They did say it was December year over year, so I assumed they focused on that month. But yea, some people really didn‚Äôt care and it‚Äôs annoying af
TBH I actually think a price hike for (most) BT products would be good, in that it would close the secondary gap and hopefully discourage resale. If they up Stagg to $80 for example, it would still move just as fast as before, but flippers would think twice about all the effort for $30 less in profit (and I doubt the secondary would be willing to adjust accordingly).

But who knows, demand is insane
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll increase their prices by much, as I‚Äôve read in the past that BT is very happy with the margins, and take pride in the fact that they make a high quality product for a reasonable cost, their words not mine, though I don‚Äôt disagree. They‚Äôve expressed dissatisfaction with the aftermarket prices for their products and have been trying to increase production as much as possible to keep up with the demand.
They are also a HUGE company.  They are building warehouses that hold 58,800 barrels.  If each barrel yields 200 bottles, and they get $10 from every bottle, that is $117.6 MILLION in revenue from each warehouse.  Even at current prices, they will have the capital paid off in little time.
His [BT whiskey tasting](https://youtu.be/w5W6mgDaJJA) was so cringey. They're gifting him a barrell pick and he's basically like 'eh, they're all the same'.
CEHT tubes were shelf turds in the not too distant past. Crazy how sentiment changes.
Could not agree more
I wouldn‚Äôt buy anything else. The Stagg Jr batch 15 I managed to get for $50 makes all my other bottles look stupid.
Even though every credible source said, and has said for a year now, ""stay home"" people said ""nah, daddy needs his tater juice more than society needs stability"" 

I hope the marked up Weller Special Reserve was worth it.
Got it. Still 1.2B investment seems like a ton. Good for them for trying to make their product more accessible at fair price points.
Yeah, the best way to being down prices is an increase in supply so I‚Äôm all for this.
Also it will just increase supply. I still can't order Buffalo Trace at my store in Massachusetts.
Delayed by 6-15 years depending on the product.
Why is that cringey, he‚Äôs just being honest.  I work at a liquor store and it‚Äôs embarrassing how many people are full of shit about their palates.  There‚Äôs also very slight variations with some of these barrel picks so when drinking one after the other all in a row, even someone that really knows their whiskey might not be able to pick out the particular notes.
Absolutely.  This whole bourbon craze has gotten out of hand. Here's a pro tip for all of you looking for Weller 12:  It's not that good.
I hear you, man. It's frustrating. I travel for work and usually love exploring everything around me in new areas... I've spent the last year in my hotel room, mostly. No local Distillery tours, no eating at those awesome local spots, no bellying up to the local watering hole... just the jobsite, hotel room and grocery stores... can't wait for this shit to be over. Some places have been open, some places have been fully shut down...
That freedom thing is a real stickler huh? Feel free to keep staying home if you are afraid. The Weller was totally worth the risk btw! Especially the full proof!
I don‚Äôt see any difference between people going to the distillery to try and find a Blanton‚Äôs during a pandemic and people going to a liquor store to try and find a Blanton‚Äôs during a pandemic.
Welcome to Kentucky. Where we defy the governors orders to get a semi average bottle that they can post on Facebook and brag about the possibly sell for a $20 profit ü§Æmurica by god
Also this expansion isn't new, they have already been undertaking it for several years now. [Here's a similar update from 2 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/8lgfv3/buffalo_trace_distillery_expansion/), where they also reference the 1.2 billion dollar expansion
They are several years into the project already without price adjustments.  I wouldn't expect any sudden changes. Kudos to BT for not raising prices.
[deleted]
Not uncommon to see capital improvements that take a couple decades to pay off.
No quarrels about his honesty with his palate. It's cringey because he's a notoriously bad gift receiver. For a guy that drinks a fair amount of whiskey and is sponsored by BT, you'd think he'd attempt some semblance of graciousness and *try* and get into it a little bit. Maybe be stoked to be able to re-gift them or sell them for charity? I'm sure a JRE BT bottle would fetch a pretty penny. It's probably a weird position to be in to be able to afford whatever you want while having people gift you valuable things for various agendas, but there's certainly more gracious ways to do it. Funny to think he may be responsible for a bump in whiskey hype but his own interest doesn't really go past ""it's good"".
I'd have to agree for the 2020 I am tasting. But one of the older 'candy bomb' 12s are what got me into bourbon in the first place
I'm an overweight asthmatic, so I'm an at risk population, so I diligently wear my mask, stay home, etc, and it's so disheartening that people refuse to wear masks because the messaging was ""masks keep you from spreading Covid"" instead of ""masks keep you from getting covid.'

My wife and I celebrated our first anniversary at home, because we don't feel comfortable even going to TGI Fridays (cheesy I know, but it's our spot), because it's located in an area that doesn't enforce mask mandates.
I am in a similar position. I went from traveling internationally a ton for work to not traveling at all. I haven‚Äôt gotten on a plane in almost a year. Made one small drive to see family in the summer last year and that‚Äôs it. Everytime I see pictures of people partying on the holidays or hear about things like this, or Disney being sold out I get more and more frustrated. They are prolonging this for everyone through their selfishness. But all that to say, it‚Äôs nice to hear someone else following the guidelines once in awhile. Your sacrifice is much appreciated.
Mid-range bourbon is worth risking giving someone Covid and killing them? That's some cold shit, brother.
You must have a popular local liquor store if 141k people a year go there.
cognitive dissonance is a hell of a drug
Except for all the price hikes last year right? OWA from $39.99 to $49.99 Full Proof went up ten dollars, etc.
Except it's all marketing. Why would they raise prices when their prices generate half the hype?

Imagine BTAC sold for the $500 MSRP it should command in today's market. The reviews suddenly take a less glowing stance as it's not a victim of mark-up but an honest-to-goodness super premium. The fans cry out in horror and boycott BT. Sales for ER, BT, Weller, and Baby Saz die down as their godfather hype bottles lose appeal at an appropriate price point. 

Buffalo Trace is a company. Too many bourbon fans get suckered into this illusion that these distilleries are good honest folk doing good honest work, and by-gum screw the money!
If they follow the same pattern they have with the Weller line, they will add additional labels and diversify their line while keeping supply low and demand high to increase hype.
Not downplaying that at all, just helping keep in perspective that even with additional revenue of $200m a year, it will be delayed. Sazerac isn't publicly traded, so I don't think I can see a public balance sheet, but I'm sure they don't have any issues with cash flow.
Okay fair enough, I will say I listened to this podcast though and he did say they were all good.
I'm not saying there weren't good years with Weller 12, just that overall it is overrated.  Lots of good bourbon out there at much lower prices.
Asthma gang in the house! Since the gyms closed, I have gained the ""Covid-19"" as well...
Literally cheesy u/hitpicket but if those loaded potato skins get the juices flowin, you do you hombre
I am in construction and have been traveling all over this country since day 1 of Covid. Haven't really missed a beat, travel wise. I fly home every other weekend. It was actually nice for the 1st 6 months, planes were empty. They're all full again since about September.
Nobody ever said you had to leave your house. Order your tater juice online and stay safe at home by yourself. Besides, I thought that masks work from spreading the virus? Do they not?
That‚Äôs a little over 400 people per day. I don‚Äôt cognitive good but I would think a lot of the busier Total Wine, BevMo, and Liquor Barns get that kind of customer volume.
Price hikes last year are to do with individual retailers due to smaller allocations.
This. This guy gets it. Even their namesake bourbon went up. It‚Äôs economics. Simple supply and demand. Just another group of advertising execs putting a spin on it so everyone thinks they‚Äôre the good guys. And don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm sure they mean well and have good intentions. I harbor no I‚Äôll will towards them and still buy their products. I‚Äôm just not a fanboy like several others are. Huge corporations are out for 1 thing, hell I would be too. Especially when you‚Äôre talking about a $1.2 B investment. Good on em for expanding to be able to offer more.
I'm not talking about moving to secondary prices.  They could easily eat up some middle ground,  say 'the pandemic is hard' and likely not impact sales. At the end of the day,  not wanting to raise prices and alienate their consumers is a financial decision, and their 'we'll just increase supply' response is one that I appreciate as a consumer. 

To be clear, I rarely drink BT products. It's a pain to find, usually marked up, and I'm too easily satisfied to get into the chase. OF, 4R, and HH have been getting my money since green label became hard to find.
As someone pointed out, that's in a month (December), not the full year. Im going to guess that most of those people don't live in the area, and they are travelling, risking the spread of Covid to the places they visit along the way.
I don't understand how a price hike isn't a price hike to BT fanboys. It doesn't matter what MSRP is, they allow and, I would argue, encourage their retailers to charge hundreds of percent above retail for their products. We can argue distribution sucks, but if they threatened to take away allocations it would stop. Like their bourbon, but realize that the long dick of Sazerac seeks only to fuck the fanboys.
‚Äú...and welcomed 145,365 visitors throughout 2020,...‚Äù sounds like the entire year. I‚Äôm not condoning taking vacations, just pointing out that ‚Äúvisitors‚Äù is mostly just KY flippers visiting the gift shop
Man what are you talking about, I work at a liquor store and we can charge whatever we want for whatever we want. We‚Äôre not the cheapest in town but that‚Äôs because we can‚Äôt buy pallets full like larger retailers, but our prices remain fair. However, others in the surrounding area will upcharge so much, especially allocations. Bottles of regular wellers go for $40 at these places. Has nothing to do with being a fanboy, I‚Äôm just trying to explain it to you. Don‚Äôt shoot the messenger, and you probably shouldn‚Äôt shoot BT either since they continue to deliver quality products at generally fair prices.
We have slightly different assumptions but I agree with you. Buffalo Trace isn't some benevolent, virtuous entity. It's a company.

That doesn't mean they're evil but whiskey fans fall hard for distilleries they enjoy and Trace is the worst offender. They don't raise MSRP because it's bad PR. Simple as thst.
That feller seems to be incorrect, who corrected me. Also, that number includes being closed for four months. It seems high to me that 600 people a day came to the distillery to flip bottles. Even if it was half flippers and half people vacationing it's an alarming number considering they are just one distillery, and they followed the rules when others skirted them.
If Buffalo Trace is as against price hiking on allocated things as they claim, they could impose punishments to the distributor for allowing it (giving them less product) and they could pass that on to liquor store who price hike. All they do is talk, talk, talk. I understand liquor stores making hay while the sun shines, but to imply that Buffalo Trace is blameless and they still raise prices is naive at best.
Except they do, and have, in the last two years, raised prices. The only reason people don't notice is because they never get to pay MSRP for BT products.
They‚Äôre a distillery not a police force. Name any others that do this, I‚Äôll wait. As I said, we can upcharge any product.  You‚Äôre also not including the distribution level so while they sell to many distributors across the country and could regulate how much those sell it to retailers for (and probably do) it would be overwhelming keeping tabs on each individual store that sells their product.
I don't keep up with Weller. In VA it will never be available. 

I hadn't noticed an increase on BT or ER. I rarely buy it, though.

My anti-BT fueled rants usually target BTAC. I still contend that it's just marketing and desiring the perception of being a kindly lil distillery.
You're missing my point, and being a dick about it. You are saying they are virtuous and grand. I am saying they aren't virtuous, and they continue to raise prices (re-fucking-gardless of reasoning). If ANY distillery wanted to stop liquor stores from price hiking, they could. That is my fucking point, but for some reason you seem to think that I'm some bleeding heart who thinks whiskey should be free.
I'm not anti-BT, but I am an enemy of their fanboys and I think their QC for single barrel products is non-existent.
Not going to argue with you any more bud. You‚Äôre saying I‚Äôve said things I‚Äôve never even hinted at. And I was just trying to help, good luck with your blame game."

*****

**Port Charlotte Valinch SYC:02, 2009 11 year, 2nd fill Syrah hogshead, 61.8%**

**Nose:** Mean and peaty, big charred peat, brine, huge clean vanilla char, sweet toasted wood, vanilla icing, bright citrus and tropical fruit. Just a sharp, sweet and charred peat bomb, excellent nose that really cuts through

**Taste:** Explosion of bright and powerful peaty flavor. Big gritty caramel and clean cutting peat, sweet vanilla and toasted wood, lemon citrus, buzzsaw of zingy spice and charred peat, but at the same time super clean with sweet barrel notes. Complex and bright and zingy, what a fun peat bomb of a PC.

**Finish:** Some raspy dark fruit and earthy wine finally comes through more, along with a slow burn of peppery spice, vanilla and huge clean peat, dark burnt caramel. Monster of a burnt sweet and peaty finish

*****

Another great cask strength Port Charlotte. Doesn't drink quite as spicy as the Jurancon Valinch but there's still a fair amount of peppery spice. Like the Jurancon the wine is very subtle and well integrated, doesn't drink like a wine bomb of a peatster. The peat is much more aggressive and vibrant on this one which probably makes it my favorite of these two Valinches, but not by a whole lot

Sounds like a killer couple of Valinches, great reviews! Interesting you picked this one as your favourite, reading your notes I feel like I'd enjoy the JUC:01 more. I do tend to prefer the more wine-forward PCs, though.
Great reviews from both of the valinches.  I'm hoping this fall could be open for travel.
Thanks! They are both great, this didn't win by a whole lot. I'm a total peat head, so in the end the more aggressive and sharper peat on this one just did it for me."

*****

**Port Charlotte Valinch JUC:01, 2009 10 year, Jurancon cask, 59.7%**

**Nose:** Heavenly peat. Huge warm peaty embrace, creamy milk chocolate, big clean vanilla, luscious caramel, tons of tropical fruit, plum, pineapple, sweet charred wood. What a beautiful peaty nose

**Taste:** Burnt caramel and huge velvety peat, peppery spice blast, dark berries, sweet vanilla, clean mild barrel char, some nutty toffee. It's spicy and peaty, any wine influence is very subtle to me. Just a wonderful clean and peaty character with a nice spice kick

**Finish:** Big blast of delicious peppery spice and a wall of peat, sweet vanilla and barrel char, some velvety soft fruits. Leaves sweet and peaty, and a bit dry

*****

A really nice Port Charlotte. The wine influence is there but it's very subtle and integrated, mostly comes across as a mildly sweeter peat bomb. Not too charred or oaky or overly wine sweetened, but there is a hefty spice kick. Really tasty stuff

500ml bottle. Hope that doesn‚Äôt catch on.
Sounds delicious! Might have to grab some if it crossed my path.
Sounds great.  I don't know how Bruichladdich can get away with wine so well when so many others are just overtaken by the wine.
Valinch bottlings are unlikely to cross your path, or at least this one is unlikely.  Traditionally they're for sale at the distillery, though Bruichladdich has been recently selling them through a lottery program (with very expensive international shipping costs).
For real, they are masters of wine aged scotch. Whether its Laddie or octomore or these, it's always such a complex and subtle thing yet still delivers huge flavor overall. Really great stuff
Hmm, might have to get on the mailing list for that lottery then."

*****

**Bruichladdich Crew Valinch #50 ""Graeme Kirk,"" 2006 13 year, refill sherry, 63.1%**

**Nose:** Sweet pleasant sherry, strawberry, raisin, chocolate, warm tingly spice, it's well integrated with rich caramel, thick robust malt, toasted wood, vanilla. Noses thick and malty with a sweet pop of well integrated fruits

**Taste:** Big blast of gritty caramel and spice, toasted wood, sweet char, thick caramel malt, nutty wine sweetness, delicious chocolatey raisin and fruits, vanilla. Not as fruity and sweet as the nose, but lots of intensely huge caramel and wood notes with delicious malt. Huge flavor, thick and syrupy. Decent spice but not overly hot

**Finish:** Syrupy fruits and spice blast builds huge. Then slowly settles as balanced fruity sweetness slowly emerges with thick luscious caramel, nuts, toasted wood, warm syrupy black cherry and dark spice. Epic finish

*****

Not your average sherried Scotch. It's an assault of hugely thick and syrupy flavor. Balanced fruity sherry, robust malt, thick wood notes and plenty of spice and it all comes at you HUGELY. Doesn't drink as hot as the Amarone Valinch, I think I like this one better although the nutty and dry sweetness is really fucking nice in the Amarone Valinch. So really I love them both. Just epic. Like the Amarone Valinch I suspect this would take water very nicely, but I didn't have enough to experiment with.

**Nose:** Thick crystal clear malt, Barley cereal, caramel, well integrated dry red wine, thick and nutty, chocolate strawberry, vanilla, warm mellow spice. Complex and thick yet smoothly flowing

**Taste:** Insanely thick syrupy caramel, hot cherry, big blast of exotic spice, big cereal malt and syrupy red wine, nutty and gritty wine notes, light chocolate. Plenty of heat but plenty of huge flavor to go along with it. Flavor just keeps building epic and huge, hot but flavorful

**Finish:** Finish is ridiculously long. Sweet wine notes, caramel, big clean Barley, sugary barley and malt notes linger with a dry wine sweetness and lots of hot lively spice

*****

Extremely well integrated wine on this, not heavy handed or overbearing at all. Lots of clean and robust barley sweetness comes through, and tons of big bold spice and heat. It all melds seamlessly into this malty, nutty, and spicy dry wine beast. Tons of heat but it also delivers tons of flavor along with it. It feels like it would take some water well, but unfortunately I didn't have enough to experiment with.

Hmmm.... this seems like a Blankenship special
Sounds like a cracker. In your opinion would you expect water and time in the glass to temper the heat? If not, do you consider it good enough to put up with the heat for?
I gave this one plenty of time considering the heat and the fact that it's from a newly opened bottle. The Score is from drinking it neat, so yes it does drink fine on it's own if you don't mind the heat. I suspect it would do very well with some water, but I only had an ounce so not quite enough to experiment with unfortunately
Thank you. I was lucky enough to get one and wanted to know how ‚Äúspecial‚Äù I should expect this to be. I‚Äôm looking forward to cracking it open."

*****

**Van Winkle Lot B 12 year, 2020, 45.2%**

**Nose:** Sweet creamy caramel, sugary and sweet, bold sweet corn, caramel orange, graham cracker, fruity cherry, vanilla, pleasant toasted wood. Sweet and desserty and inviting but with some nice rich Bourbon notes, super pleasant nose

**Taste:** Sweet corn, big sweet creamy caramel, brown sugar, warm orange, rich Bourbony caramel, bright clean toasted wood, vanilla, orange caramel. Easy drinking, but with nice rich flavor that is all around pleasant and fun. So drinkable and balanced

**Finish:** Caramel orange, sweet sugary corn and clean toasted wood, faintest hint of pleasant Bourbon spice. Deliciously sweet and balanced finish, sugary and Bourbony

*****

This drinks so happy and fun, desserty and sweet, but balanced by lots of corn and classic sweet Bourbony richness. It's just super pleasant all around. I think the age and 45% abv work together really well to give this a rich yet super smooth and drinkable feel. Won't quite kick your ass like a cask strengther might but it is plenty flavorful and so completely balanced. Great stuff

What I would do for a retail priced bottle of pappy...
Nice, I'm really glad you noted the cherry because that was a really strong smell that I got. Nice write up, I tend to agree.
I'd keep it one on the shelf to fill the low proof spot.
I just sampled some as well. Came away with similar (not as detailed) feelings. Cheers!
But this isn't pappy
This is about as good as low proof Bourbon gets
Something has to go there ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I don‚Äôt come to this Reddit very often and it is oftentimes because of the detailed and thorough reviews like the one you commented on above. I love bourbon but I can‚Äôt begin to appreciate it anywhere near as close to the level as the above.  Cheers!
üòë
Nice review! I know reviews are subjective, but I was greatly underwhelmed by Lot B. There are multiple under 100 proofs that I greatly prefer. I personally soundly pay MSRP for Lot B.
You're not alone.  I can pick out a couple flavors and I know what I like, but I can't begin to understand how some of these reviews contain these flavors (this one is pretty mild one imo).  Like, how are you tasting chocolate-covered cherries in a bourbon?
[deleted]
I think part of the fun is stretching your imagination a bit. Smell and taste are so strongly linked to memory and emotion that it makes sense to me that people would get a bit fanciful in the retelling of a whiskey, much like a good storyteller can weave a tale. Here I go appreciating the subtle notes of my own farts, but hell, I don't care. Memory and imagination are fun. Throw whiskey into the mix, and you are going to get some fun reviews like the ones posted below me.

Ngl I just giggled like a little girl and got a funny look from my wife.  Talk about loving the smell of your own farts.  That has to be satire, right?
I'm not reading a review for whimsical nostalgia though.  I'm reading it so I know what it tastes like and if it sounds like flavors I'd be interested in.  Descriptors are fine and all, it just gets silly and humorous when folks write like it's a romance novel.
We all know wet spanish saddle leather tastes *vastly* different than dry or Italian saddle leather.

**Russell's Reserve 2003 16 year, 44.75%**

**Nose:** Rich woody caramel, warm orange and caramel, chocolate, mellow barrel char, mild anise spice, sweet toasted wood, sweet vanilla char. Sweet and toasted, lots of delicious caramel. Complex in a relaxed and easygoing way. Very inviting

**Taste:** Smooth woody and caramel flavor, easygoing and approachable at the proof. Definitely drinks light but doesn't feel too thin or watered down. Dry tannic wood, sweet toasted oak, woody caramel, brighter cherry sweetness emerges from the smooth sweet wood, slightly metallic, vanilla

**Finish:** Chocolatey oak and sweet thick caramel, sweet toasted wood, vanilla, mellow easygoing spice

*****

This is about as balanced as a Bourbon can get, wow. Delicious and easygoing flavors that flow and balance effortlessly. And it drinks effortlessly as well. Nice smooth mouthfeel without feeling too thin or watered down. Really nice stuff. It's fun to sip on something like this and imagine a simpler time, when everything didn't have to be some huge barrel proof bruiser. It's delicious in an old school kind of way. It does still drink like a light and smooth 45% Bourbon though, so it's better for that smooth and easygoing kind of sipping mood

realy good stuff!!
Nice
This sounds really nice.
I pulled the trigger on this bottle the other day, slightly above msrp at $270. Im going to open it on my birthday in May.
> It's fun to sip on something like this and imagine a simpler time, when everything didn't have to be some huge barrel proof bruiser.

I member those days
Nice! It's no GTS but it's good Turkey. Definitely more rare than GTS, so the pricing makes sense.
Now we‚Äôre talking bourbon!
I called it dusty water, no depth and drinks very thin. Wtmk17bib is a much better recent expression.
What's the msrp, about $200? I had this from a sample and it's good, but I don't think I liked it enough to pay that. It might still be tempting though if I ever found a whole bottle just because of how unique it is. So I feel your pain
Yeah I think the price mostly makes sense. Especially considering the age and the fact that it's a distillery bottling instead of some weird sourced nonsense shrouded in mystery. I probably wouldn't buy it having tasted it though, just personal preference. I think of some of the Armagnac or Mezcal I could enjoy more for that price haha
$350 in WA. My store wants $700. Sounds wonderful but I have to pass it by.
They want 249. Which is decent, but way too much for me
I would definitely pass at that price. But I drink scotch and other spirits so I just think of how much better I could do with that money
Do you mind sharing where this is located? I just picked up their recent private barrel selection and it‚Äôs delicious.
I‚Äôm also interested - if you find its still there I may be able to have someone stop by for me.
I guess. It‚Äôs steep. I like Russell‚Äôs but not that much
Maryland. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs still there, but I‚Äôll check.
It wasn‚Äôt. It had been there a month.
If you can find a good single barrel pick those are excellent for around $60
Thanks for checking
Yep, I‚Äôve got one. Haven‚Äôt cracked it yet. But for 50, can‚Äôt beat it
One of my top 10 best bottles of bourbon I've ever had was RR sib that was so full of cherry which played off the Wild Turkey funk so well. It was amazeballs.
There's some duds out there, but mostly I've had good luck with them. And some of them can be downright amazing, I've easily enjoyed some great RR picks as much or more than this 16 year. Good luck with yours!
Yeah they can be ridiculously good. Where was it from?
Yeah, a buddy recommended it, and says it‚Äôs pretty good, so it‚Äôs on the list. But I try and keep my open bottles to under 10. Gotta finish something else first

*****

**George T Stagg, 2020 release, 130.4/65.2%**

**Nose:** Thick woody nose, some of the most rich and delicious wood notes I've ever come across in a Bourbon. Huge dark toasted oak, thick and chocolatey, big musty wood, smooth tobacco, dry tannic notes, rich mellow cherry cola, big big vanilla, undercurrent of chocolate mint spice. So thick and chocolatey and oaky and mellow, very inviting

**Taste:** It starts as a mellow and chocolatey cherry cola, then slowly builds and explodes with flavor on the palate. Huge toasted oak, chocolatey and rich, zingy and syrupy sweet black cherry, deeeep woody caramel, big heavy wood notes but with a lively corn sweetness, big spice blast but not overly hot. Syrupy and thick and woody and hot. So complex and lively, but all the notes run very deep and rich. The oak is huge and complex but never overwhelms. The longer you sit with it the better it gets, I feel like it could air out and evolve for hours

**Finish:** Long oaky and sweet finish. Big blast of sweet oak and tons of sweet woody caramel, cherry cough syrup, wood must, long lingering spice heat, deep toasted chocolatey oak and vanilla

*****

This is my very first Stagg, and wow what a treat. Some of the most delicious and interesting oak structure I've ever had in a Bourbon. Especially on the nose, I could just sit and nose this stuff all day I think. Heavy, heavy oak but it's not just a bitter oak bomb at all. It's chocolatey and rich wood, with just enough smooth tobacco and tannic bite to let you know it's age. But it stays very well balanced with the syrupy and spicy hot sweetness. Quite hot but it's the balanced kind of heat you get with age, similar to some Elijah Craig Barrel Proof and Knob Creek single barrels. Just an all around great Bourbon. Considering the hype it gets I feel obligated to say that it's hardly the end-all of Whiskey though. I would easily rate this right alongside some of the better FRPS's, WP 10's, and old bottle style ECBP's I've had. But it's fantastic stuff, and it's definitely not a profile that I have seen done this well anywhere else.

The best bourbon I‚Äôve ever had
great review. waiting to crack mine until my first divorce.
Great review - looking at houses and I‚Äôm planning to crack mine as the first pour in the new home!

If anyone takes anything away from this review it should be this - if you find a non or semi-allocated whiskey you really like, don‚Äôt be afraid to stock up. I‚Äôve tried a lot of allocated and tough to find stuff and it‚Äôs usually really good but I often have the same take as OP in regards to comparing it to really good whiskey you can find. And then I look back at the time I spent searching for allocated stuff and I actually wish I stocked up on more Elijah Craig C919 or Booker‚Äôs Country Ham etc. when I had the chance. Because really really good whiskey can only be so much better than really good whiskey.  So, if you can get your hands on really good whiskey like C919, B520, C920, and, from early reports, A121, you should get it while you can. Because ECBP C919 aint walkin thru that door and soon enough C920 and A121 will be gone too.
I've only had the chance to buy a pour of this for $25 at a bar and wow I was amazed. Would love to find a bottle but I most likely never will. Great review.
Your review notes were much more evocative of the pour than mine, but I gave this a 9 as well. Fantastic release.
I‚Äôve had the 2019 and 2020. The 2020 is bourbon at its best!
If I could only find it in my area.
How does it compare to Stag Jr?r?
'20 GTS was a winner, great review and I'm glad you enjoyed it. I didn't get the chocolate but otherwise I definitely agree with the cherry cola start then flavor explosion description!
Great review and congrats on #200 bud! So just to clarify, is this your first GTS bottle or the first time trying GTS?
I‚Äôve only had the 2018, but it was love at first sip.  For me, its about as good as bourbon can get.

Great review & congrats on 200 bourbon reviews, always enjoy reading your stuff!
Nice review - you inspired me to post my review of the 2018 release.
I unbuckled my pants 3/4 of the way through the nose section
This one really is great. I‚Äôve tried a few different years. I love the finish and how warm it is in my chest. The heat is totally supported by the flavors.
Curious what FRPS is?
Happy cake day! Yeah it's great stuff
I was lucky enough to try this yesterday. It‚Äôs about as close to a perfect bourbon as it gets. Such a good bourbon.
Me too. Would love to own a bottle someday.
Did a blind the other night for giggles a119, b519, c920, and a121.  A121 hands down the best and hasn't even ""opened up"" yet.  Vanilla bomb!
Honestly, I think a pour for 25 dollars is an amazing deal given how much these go for in the secondary market.
>Would love to find a bottle but I most likely never will.

I've always said the same exact thing. Truth is I got very lucky winning the chance to buy this in a lottery. It's my first time winning anything like this. I wish I could give you tips like ""develop a relationship with a store blah blah blah"" but yeah, odds aren't good on this stuff these days. My plan has always been to just wait and hope that one day increased production will catch up with demand, and that this stuff will be easier to find in 10-15 years.
Found GTS and Jr at a restaurant Halseys in Geneva NY...$18 either one and great food mind ü§Ø
Ha, I'll take that as a compliment. Funny thing is I like shorter reviews myself and try to keep mine more simple, but they always get away from me. Especially on the better pours like this. I read your review, really enjoyed it
It's surprisingly similar in flavor and character actually. Jr is a lot thinner and brasher, daddy Stagg is richer and more chocolatey oak with much better integrated heat and flavor
I'm glad I enjoyed it too haha. So glad I was able to win a bottle. I often get a chocolatey vibe from thick rich wood notes that aren't overly bitter
Thanks, it's been fun. And this worked out perfect to be #200

>first GTS bottle or the first time trying GTS?

Both! It always seemed so unobtainable, so I didn't even care to mess with it. I never had any BTAC before this
Glad to hear that, thank you so much! Agreed, this is about as good it gets. Just an all around great Bourbon. Although I do still think younger and more brash Bourbons like FRPS and Stagg jr have their place, still delicious just a different kind of profile. And of course I will always love Rye too
[deleted]
Completely agree!
Thanks, and right on. Reviewing is so much fun. Regardless of whether anyone even reads or enjoys my reviews I find that it can really help me appreciate stuff on a different level
Four Roses Single Barrel Private Select. Those are the barrel proof single barrels that stores pick, and they are great
Where do you even find a bottle like this?
Will be buying the first A121 I see!
I'd buy that in a heartbeat.  Not sure what the size pour is, but even at 1 oz, it's a decent deal.  1.5 or 2 oz it's almost a steal, and I'd drink it every time I was at that bar.
I‚Äôd drink that GTS bottle down a bit at that price!
Yeah definitely a great one to win. Ah that makes sense. I'll have to look for that next time I have a pour
Wow, I was unaware and I‚Äôm a bit surprised. I just assumed after 200 reviews you must have traded a sample here or there before. GTS is overall my favorite bourbon so I‚Äôm glad you got your hands on this 2020 which I thought was very good!
Love both of those as well! Especially the B mashbill on those 4R picks, and Stagg Jr isn‚Äôt too far behind GTS, imo.
You'll get used to it at full proof and then lower proof won't taste as good
I tend not to add water to any whisky, but if you get a bottle & that‚Äôs how you prefer it, add away.
I generally don't ever dilute, but to each their own. As long as you're enjoying it you're doing it right
If I snagged a bottle like this, I'd definitely start tasting it neat, then add a tiny bit of water to see how the flavor evolves, then add more water to proof it down closer to 100 proof or so, comparing each experience. But the magic in a bottle like this is gonna come from tasting it at full strength, at least for some pours.

What proof are you used to? It may be worth it to slowly move up in proof so you can experience bottles like this without being kicked in the teeth. Plus you'll get to experience everything the bourbon world has to offer if you're not limited by high-proof burn.
This one is good straight. The heat is warm in your chest, not harsh.
I found it at a whiskey bar in my city‚Äîplaces like that are usually a better bet than trying to find an entire bottle at a store. But it really is just luck sometimes.
I am unashamed to admit that if it wasn't for that fact that I already have a bottle of GTS, I would literally keep ordering pours at that price until I emptied the bottle. If the pour was about 1.5 oz for 25 dollars, that'd be roughly 300ish dollars. Which of course, is like triple for what its MSRP is, but thats still half the cheapest I've seen it in the wild.
>Stagg Jr isn‚Äôt too far behind GTS, imo.

Yes! I kept thinking that with this Stagg. The Jr bottle is quite a bit thinner and less oaky, but I couldn't help noticing how well they nailed the profile of the daddy Stagg with the jr bottle
I love the big proofers, but sometimes just a fingertip flick of water can turn a pour into a completely different thing.  It really really sets off ECBP B520 for me.
Neat with a soda back (glass of club soda) works well for some. 
Also helps clear the palate for multiple sampling nights.
[deleted]
very true. I found a bottle of bookers for $100 when in Phoenix, I had never even seen one at retail until then
Which Jr? I think Batch 14 was spectacular next to Sr. 15 has been a bit of a let down after 14.
Just saw your ninja edit on the other comment, makes sense now! Yeah honestly it comes down to getting used to the proof. It can also help to work up to it in a single sitting. Have a bit of another bourbon at your usual preferred proof, then move higher. For me, even Old Forester 1920 can be a bit much to start out at 115 proof, but if I go to something around 100 first, suddenly the 1920 is more approachable."

Scotch review #220

*****

**Islay Strait (Caol Ila) 2010 10 year, K&L Sovereign, sherry butt finish, 59.6%**

**Nose:** Charred and sulfury peat. Huge Islay peat, gritty sulfury char, big menthol spice, vanilla and charred toasted wood, bright tropical fruit, sulfury pineapple. Tons of sulfur and menthol that works really well with the peat

**Taste:** Like the nose, lots of menthol and sulfur and it works really well. Big charred and dirty peat, caramel, gritty sulfur and vanilla barrel char, bright sulfury tropical fruit, caramel, sweet chocolatey and vanilla wood, tons of menthol. Not overly hot at all, lots of flavor if you like your peat sulfury and mentholated and charred

**Finish:** Caramel and spice, huge blast of charred menthol vanilla, huge clean peat, sweet tropical pop, sulfury and charred. The charred menthol and peat lingers a long time

*****

Great bottle with a fun and unusual profile. So much fun. Peaty obviously but lots of interesting char and sulfur and menthol, gives it a nice gritty and dirty edge. But it still maintains a sweet and bright feel, very clean. More tropical and bright kind of fruitiness than anything super sherried to me. Great Caol Ila, it pops and buzzes with cool flavor and tons of clean peat

Damn! I don't like sulfur. Other than that, it sounds like an amazing islay :)
Might want to stay away from this one then haha. I'm curious though if someone sensitive to sulfur notes would experience this in a similar way. It's not the usual dirty earthy sherry kind of sulfur, it's very clean and peaty still
I love sulphur when it's right, and although ten-ish Caol Ila is raining from the sky at the moment, this one sounds like it should go on the list :-)"

Brandy review #33

*****

**Eniseli XO Georgian Brandy, 12-15 year blend, 40%**

**Nose:** Weird funk on this. Soy sauce, mushroom, toasted wood, wood spice, burnt toffee, tobacco, mildly bitter wood. Weird notes that could be overwhelming but the low abv keeps it tame and balanced. I am getting very little fruit sweetness on this, maybe a light woody grape. Almost reminds me of wood aged baiju

**Taste:** Thinish toasted wood and caramel, chocolate, sweet and sour sauce, that light and mildly sour Baiju note, a mild anise twang, vanilla and sweet funky wood. Some weird notes but like the nose I think the low abv keeps it very tame. It actually feels a bit thin at 40%. But the flavors balance well with the sweet chocolatey wood. It's sweet but not in the usual fruity brandy kind of way

**Finish:** Chocolatey wood and caramel, mild sweet anise, vanilla. A more traditional sweet mildly woody finish

****

There's some odd notes on this at first, but either I acclimated to it or the air smoothed it out. Not very much fruit sweetness at all, but there's some really nice sweet and chocolatey wood to this. Along with the smooth mild funk, I almost might have guessed this as a rum if I had tried it blind. It was a journey for sure, I hated it at first but it slowly calmed down and it grew on me. Main complaint now is that it's a little too thin at 40%

*****

**Menorval Tres Vieux XO 15 year Calvados, 40%**

**Nose:** Rich juicy red apple, absolutely no tartness, smooth rich caramel, graham cracker, easy toasted wood, sweet vanilla, delicious tingly spice. It's so rich and warm and inviting, delicious nose. For comparison, I poured some Breuil 12 to drink alongside this. Breuil nose is lighter and a bit more dry

**Taste:** Really fun flavor here. Sticky sweet apple cider, juicy red apple, caramel apple, bright sweet caramel, very mild zingy tartness, vanilla. It pops, feels very complex and lively but in a balanced way overall. Just tastes fun. Breuil is more toned down and even keeled, more caramel-y and less bold bright apple like this has

**Finish:** Pops with bold sweet apple then settles down into thicker and fruitier juicy red apple, toffee, caramel wood, lingering gritty brown sugar applesauce

*****

This is fantastic. Bold and complex with delicious flavor. Drinks great, it just tastes so fun and so right. To compare it to the two other Calvados I've had it's somewhere between Breuil 12 and Camut 12. The Breuil is more smooth and dry, while the Camut is just a rich apple-y beast. This is the flavorful and drinkable middle ground. This was a really fun review and a great Calvados

**""La Vieille Prune"" Plum Brandy 4 year, Reserve L.O.R., 42%**

**Nose:** Strong distinct nose, bright sweet Plum, sharp and mildly tart, green apple, nose-numbing ester, candy caramel, sweet and sharp and happy

**Taste:** Richer and warmer flavor emerges on the palate, but still very sweet. Thick caramel, big rich Plum super bold and bright, tart green apple, that sharp ester flavor, sweet wood, sugary frosting. It's minimal wood influence, mostly a balanced caramel richness. This is all about the rich and sugary fruit

**Finish:** Bright sugary sweet plum, candy caramel, estery funk, long and sweet and rich

*****

Delicious, and very distinct from other fruit brandies. The rich plum is the main attraction here, wood influence is minimal and well integrated. There's an interesting play of flavors between the sugary sweetness and sharp esters, with tons of rich Plum fruitiness. The sugary sweetness is something I would have to be in the mood for, I couldn't drink this all the time. But very nice stuff at the age

**Nose:** Malty and thick, cereal malt, rich honey, floral notes, caramel, light sherry sweetness, light raisin and berry, green apple. Inoffensive and pleasant 

**Taste:** Thick honey and cereal malt, rich caramel, light fruity and sweet sherry, strawberry and floral notes, cake frosting. Textbook sherry finish, it's thick and malty with a light sweet sherry influence. Rich and meaty mouthfeel. 

**Finish:** Warm peppery spice, thick honey malt and sweet syrupy sherry that slowly rides out thick and rich

*****

This is textbook sherry *finish*, malty Scotch with a light sherry influence. The expected flavors all present themselves nicely in a balanced way. It's actually quite thick and chewy for a Glenfiddich, nice rich malty flavor here. There's maybe a hint of stale and funky flavor, but nothing too bad. Nothing mind blowing but for the price it's a winner I think. At the behest of DavidOG from K&L I tried it with a few drops of water, it smooths out the mouthfeel and melds all the notes together nicely into this floral honey malty and fruity sherry. It's great with or without water

I've never heard of a teaspoons blend before. Is that an American thing?
By definition, it's a Scottish thing since it's something they do to Scotch Whisky. It's something distilleries sometimes do when they sell spirits to independent bottlers, and they don't want the bottler using their name. By teaspooning it with malt from another distillery, it's no longer a ""Single Malt Scotch Whisky"" and can't be sold as such. Glenfiddich and Balvenie do it a lot, I've seen Glenfarclas do it too. This is the first time I've seen someone do it on purpose just to bring the price down, so it's an interesting thing."

Brandy Review #30

*****

**Domaine Seailles 1979 41 year, 46%**

**Nose:** Smells about as dark and tannic as you would expect from the color. Darkly charred and tannic wood, dark syrupy tart grape, blackberry, burnt black cherry, menthol, bitter chocolate, soy sauce, heavy vanilla. Dark, complex, and densely packed. Oh yeah this is age all right

**Taste:** Dark, dry, and bitter wood. Charred and darkly toasted, bitter chocolate, soy sauce. Subtle darkly burnt grape syrup slowly emerges from all the dark tannic wood, burnt blackberry, leather, bitter burnt brown sugar, wood spice, vanilla. Flavor is so dark and densely packed, it's just impossible. You are pretty much just sucking on dark charred wood with subtle fruitiness

**Finish:** Sweeter fruity grape finally shines a little brighter on the finish with burnt woody mint, sweet vanilla, tobacco, dark bitter char. More sweetness on the finish than anywhere else but still kind of dry

*****

This stuff taste exactly like you can imagine from the color. It could use more fruitiness, the dark bitter wood has really started to take over. And it's a bit dry. But not as dry and boring as the 36 year reviewed prior. There's some subtle burnt tart fruits and sweet vanilla in there, and the tannic bitter wood notes are big and complex if you're into that kind of thing. Not ""enjoyable"" in the way that more balanced and fruity yaks are, but tasting all that dark woody age and condensed flavor of 40 years is such a unique experience that it is fun in it's own way. Steer clear if you aren't into a bitter oak bomb that could probably use more fruit

* [2000 20 year](https://www.reddit.com/r/Armagnac/comments/li0t84/review_469_domaine_seailles_2000_20_year_46/): was my favorite

* [20 ans blend](https://www.reddit.com/r/Armagnac/comments/lgjwcs/review_468_domaine_seailles_20_year_44/): was also great

* 1979 41 year: probably rank it similarly to 20 ans but it's so different it's hard to compare

* [1986 34 year](https://www.reddit.com/r/Armagnac/comments/ljb9nw/review_470_domaine_seailles_1986_34_year_46/): by far my least favorite, but still decent

*****

**Domaine Seailles 1986 34 year, 46%**

**Nose:** Rich caramel and grape, floral, butterscotch, caramel toasted wood, dry woody tannin, warm spice. Very nice and smooth, a bit too light. Not super woody at all for the age

**Taste:** After the richer nose this is much more dry on the palate. Dry and lightly woody, smooth caramel oak, understated grape and berry, butterscotch, sweet floral spice, clean woodiness. It's a bit light and overly dry for my tastes, but nothing bad. Nice light flavor, smooth sweet wood and understated fruit

**Finish:** Some richer fruits emerge of grape, zingy black cherry, blackberry, with light caramel and dry wood. 

*****

It's decent but a little underwhelming. Especially at the age, and especially considering how fantastic the 2000 and the 20 year blend were (at much younger ages and the same abv). It might just be my personal taste though. Because it's good but it's quite dry and light which isn't really my cup of tea. I prefer things more vibrant and punchy which the previous two releases did well(especially the 2000). It's tasty stuff but it's by far my least favorite of the 3 so far

**Nose:** Dark and oaky, tobacco, cherry cough syrup, grape, chocolate, dark toasted wood, lightly tannic, vanilla, mellow wood spice. Darker and oakier than the 20 year blend, very nice and stays approachable.

**Taste:** Smooth, dark, and sweet. Dark burnt grape, blackberry, menthol spice, cherry syrup, caramel, smooth dark toasted wood, mildly tobacco and tannic, sweet vanilla. It's quite dark and oaky but pulls it off in a mellow and approachable way. Still tons of dark sweetness, never gets too bitter. Really tasty stuff

**Finish:** Sweet caramel and vanilla, dark and oaky, light grape and menthol spice. Bit of a thin finish but it's good. Sweet and dark

*****

I really love this one. After the more warm and balanced Seailles 20 year blend that I reviewed before this one, it's much darker and oakier. But it still has tons of nice yak sweetness and it never feels too oaky or bitter. Mouthfeel is nice and flavorful at 46%, doesn't feel overly light but it's not punching above it's weight or anything either. Both 20 years are winners but very different styles. This one is my favorite of the two. Unfortunately I feel like the price is a tad high on both

**Taste:** Enormous peat, crisp clean and thick. Huge briny peat, sweet caramel, lemon zest, vanilla, crisp biting peat, sweet buttery wood, clean sweet char. The peat builds to epic heights, it's intense but still feels very clean and focused with sweet buttery wood notes. A proper Islay peat monster

**Finish:** Huge sweet peat, vanilla icing, salted caramel, peppery heat and fierce biting peat. Sweet and intensely peaty finish. Clean sharp peat lingers a long time

*****

A great I slay peat monster. I've had several of these in the 3-4 year range, they are always impressive for their age but now this one getting some actual decent age on it is just amazing. And a great bargain at the $50 it went for on FineDrams. Big fan of peated Bunna already and this just further cements that. I think a faint hint of funky ethanol creeps in at the edges, but it's minor. This stuff with some better barrels and age has the potential to be incredible I think.

How do I get my hands (and taste buds) on a bottle of this???!
Is Armagnac a better drink than Cognac? Or is it the other way round?
Glad to see that some peeps from this subreddit are trying out (and enjoying) our Armagnac barrel pick.
I second that, I am having trouble finding anything shipping to US from l‚Äôencantada
Armagnac and Cognac are just two different styles of Grape Brandy, both can be great so it will come down to personal preference. Cognac tends to be more delicate and mild and ""smooth,"" Armagnac is more bold and woody.
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention this was a pick in the description. I edited the review. It's a great one, if you were involved at all then well done and thanks!

Bourbon review #199

*****

**Widow Jane 12 year, Hoppy Ending pick, 99 proof / 49.5%**

**Nose:** Really nice and woody. Friendly dark toasted oak, chocolatey and toasted, mint char, vanilla, woody caramel, candied black cherry. Lots of dark toasted wood in a very friendly and inviting way

**Taste:** Mellow and woody. Mellow clean toasted oak, lots of sweet caramel, smooth chocolate, warm sweet mint and cherry, vanilla. Lots of clean toasted oak and caramel. I love this kind of sweet and woody profile. Like an approachable oak bomb. For the proof it drinks light, but it's super sippable and smooth

**Finish:** Lots of sweet toasted wood and caramel, mild sweet spice and minty char

*****

I admit I wasn't expecting much from this, figured it was just another subpar sourced brand. But I grew a little more interested when I noticed the age and proof. And now I am pleasantly surprised to say that this is some great stuff. It's simple and straightforward classic Bourbon flavor, sweet caramel and woody and smooth in all the best ways. It drinks a little toned down and light for the proof, but all the flavor is spot on Bourbon goodness

**Nose:** Dank, earthy, sweet. Toffee, brine, earthy smoke, mild tobacco, dark fruity sherry, mellow spice, sulfury wine, caramel, clove spice. Typical funky Scotia with nice mellow sherry

**Taste:** Very nice sherry flavor, clean and flavorful. Lots of Scotchy caramel and malt. Fruity and winey sherry, dark raisin, fig, wine funk, earthy caramel, malt, sharp spice. Sweet and thick. It's a dark and oaky sherry, not too heavy with lots of caramel and malt

**Finish:** Big slow burn of dark spice and sweet winey sherry, dark burnt oak, sweet caramel. Long hot finish, very nice.

**7/10**

**Mystery ""side by side"" sample**

**Nose:** Mellow sherry, musty funk, caramel, some sweet plum and cherry, sulfury wine, nice but a bit too tame and closed

**Taste:** Plum, sweet wine, gritty caramel, some dark earthy wood. Nice flavor here, sweet fruits and Scotchy caramel, but it's still a bit closed.

**Finish:** Big finish. Sweet sulfury wine, caramel, big delicious spice

**6/10**

*****

A nice sherried Glen Scotia. Dark and sweet and meaty, No real complaints. I really love the light funky smoke and brine on the nose, that's very typical Glen Scotia to me and it works well with the sherry influence. I just wish that Scotia character carried over to the palate more. Like I said though no real complaints, it's a beautiful Scotch with light tasty sherry influence. A good Glen Scotia has a way of just feeling so damn ""Scotchy.""

As for the blind sample drank alongside it, I didn't like it as much. It was tasty, but it just felt kind of weak and closed compared to the big meaty flavors of the Glen Scotia 16. I'm actually wondering if it was the very same Scotch, but with some water added as an experiment? It definitely had some similar notes to it although the fruits were a little more candy sweet than the dark earthy sweetness of the 16.

**Reveal:** Glen Scotia 18 Cadenhead's 56.9% (gonna need more info about the particulars of this bottling, but it might be [this one](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/105100/glen-scotia-1999-ca))

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** Well, glad I was right about it being a Scotia. It wasn't bad, but felt weak when drank alongside the bigger flavors of the 16 year. It might have even scored a point higher drank on it's own

my huge issue with glen scotia is that its often hard to tell how peated this exact production was, like ranging from some corerange who have 0 peat to victoriana which has some I think to the festival bottles that havea lot, these single casks and their aroma descriptions are often unclear and I had some SMWS ones that were just really terrible for me although I love the ones with more peat
Yes, that's the correct bottle for the 18, from the wood range. It had just been open for a few days, so I'm not sure how it will change with time yet. 

I know their scotchwhisky.com listing mentions unpeated distillate, but in [this interview](http://whiskytours.scot/interview-ian-mcalister-glenscotia-distillery/) with the distillery manager he only says they do lightly and heavily peated, so I'm not sure what their source was for that.
This whole parcel of Glen Scotia sherry casks that Cadenhead‚Äôs has is superb. This is such a great style of whisky imho. Hope they still have a few casks left. The 18 is definitely my favorite of the lot, love how dirty it is.
Agree, their peat is all over the place. Bottlings can range from zero peat, to earthy funk, to light smokiness, to damn near peat bombs. More often than not though it's a light smoke from them, it just seems like it is easily softened and overpowered for whatever reason
My impression is that lightly peated is the norm for them, and sometimes you come across different stuff. Very interesting distillery, it can be all over the place in profile and quality. But that's interesting thanks"

World Whisky review #20

*****

**Barrell Rye (Canada) 13 year, L940, 126.96/63.48%**

**Nose:** Big blast of clove and allspice, cinnamon, really cleans out the nose. graham cracker, sharp metallic twang, big rye spice, clove and anise that almost burns. It's very sharp and cutting and lively, makes you feel alive

**Taste:** Wow, huge blast of sharp intense flavor. Huge zingy cinnamon and clove explodes on the palate, metallic copper twang, sharp and spicy, graham cracker, stark Rye grain. So lively and action packed in a sharp and buzzing way. I really dig it

**Finish:** Zingy clove and cinnamon Rye spice that buzzes and whirs on the palate a long time, sweet Rye grain. Not overly hot, but tons of spicy and complex crazy Rye action

*****

* This is a very unique and interesting experience, haven't had a Rye quite like this before. I could totally see this being from some oddball distillery and not the usual Alberta stuff. The Rye flavor is intense and cutting, lots of numbing and burning flavors like cinnamon and clove. It attacks the senses like a buzzsaw. I could see it turning some people off, but as a Rye fiend it's tons of fun. Wood influence is minimal despite the age, possibly some refill or tired barrel stuff going on which is par for the course with Canadian Whiskey. But it works out well. Fun for it's sheer uniqueness

I have the L949 13 year, it's awful.
Great review my friend :) for me the metallic part and the sharpness were too much.
Tbh this one might be awful too, I seem to be in a minority here haha. Other reviews of similar bottles have been bad, and my friend disliked this very same bottle so much that he got rid of it. What can I say though, I likes it. It is very funky and odd but unique
Yes, the copper and metallic flavor was very sharp and strong. It was one of the unusual flavors that I seemed to like for some reason along with all the big burning clove and anise
I also pawned off my bottle to a friend. It was hotter than hell."

Brandy review #25

*****

**Adrien Camut Calvados 12 year, 41%**

**Nose:** Huge juicy red apple, deep and rich, applesauce and brown sugar, rich musty wood, more complex fruits of sweet berries and pear, toffee, light toasted char.

**Taste:** Bold and bright red apple, super dense and rich with flavor. All kinds of complex and rich apple flavor like juicy red apple, applesauce, rich stewed apples. It's not overwhelming at all though, it's mellowed and intertwined beautifully with smooth rich woodiness, thick mellow toffee, brown sugar. So thick and juicy

**Finish:** Crisp and clean red apple, bright almost, and then a little bit more of a tart green flavor coming through with tons of sweet brown sugar

*****

* This is so much more than just ""apple flavored"" or ""apple brandy."" It's a celebration of rich dense apple flavor and beautifully balanced wood. So thick and juicy tasting. I tend to get green apple a lot from apple brandies, with that sharp tart flavor. This is totally different, it's rich and juicy red apple that is bold and bright yet smooth and rich at the same time. Just beautiful. I drank it sbs with some Breuil 12 year, and the Breuil can't hold a candle to this. They are both 41%, but it's insane how much richer and bolder the Camut is at the same abv.

**Chateau de Pellehaut 1989 31 year, 100% Ugni Blanc, 49.9%**

**Nose:** Fruity sweet and very balanced, candy cherry, smooth sweet grape, thick gentle spice, clove, cherry wood, coffee, smooth dark oak. Very straightforward and even keeled Armagnac nose, smooth and rich

**Taste:** Straightforward tasty yak, but the flavor is a bit washed out and hot. Warm smooth grape and candy cherry, lightly toasted oak, hot zingy spice, caramel oak, vanilla. Flavor is balanced and tasty but light for the ABV, and it's a bit hot for how light the flavor is.

**Finish:** Simple finish of syrupy sweet grape and caramel, bit of spice. Tasty and straightforward

*****

* This is good straightforward yak, but maybe underwhelming for the age and abv. The nose is the best part, after that the flavor is a little washed out and hot. It has the heat of a high abv yak but the flavor needs more oomph. Not quite thin necessarily, just lacking a little. It's tasty enough though, a nice straightforward and fruity yak, a pleasant sipper even if it isn't one of the best yaks on my shelf. It goes for about $100, I would be disappointed if I had paid much more. Pellehaut seems somewhat easy to find, so if it's the only yak you can get it's a perfectly good example of the spirit style.

i‚Äôve had several iterations of 80s pellehaut including a couple different releases of 89 over the years. i‚Äôve always thought they were well balanced and a great value - this is the first time i‚Äôve read complaints about being too hot or thin but everybody has different tastes. i was also paying ~ $70 a bottle so there was a higher value proposition. i haven‚Äôt picked up one in a while though.
110% Agree, a good value yak - but it just feels like its missing something in the flavor department. Also a bit hot for the age. I was hoping mine would open up and settle down with air exposure, but it never quite did.
This is my first pellehaut. I've got a sample coming of another one that I will try. I agree it's a great value, but it just tastes like a value bottle a little bit to me as well. I've had 40-45% stuff that drinks much better than this at 49%"

**North Star ""Orkney"" (Highland Park) 2007 11 year, The Whisky Barrel Exclusive, refill hogshead/PX finish, 63.7%**

**Nose:**Thick, brooding, and rich. Dark gritty sherry, blackberry, rich toffee, thick toasted cherry wood, deep brooding spice, chocolate fudge, vanilla.

**Taste:** Thick flavor. Big rich caramel and chocolate, cherry and dark wood, big spice, smooth dark sherry, thick malt and dark sweet caramel. Rich and fudgy with lots of spice and a sweet edge

**Finish:** Huge toffee and fudgy chocolate, dark spice and sherry, black cherry. A huge epic finish, sludgy and rich

*****

* This is a really cool Scotch, I dig it a lot. And it's fantastic. It's huge and powerful, makes full use of the 63.7% abv to deliver tons of dense flavor. There's some significant spice heat for sure but it never feels too needlessly hot or brash at all. Very interesting profile too, sherry adds a darkly sweet and mysterious element but without taking over. Whole thing is very thick and powerful. A few drops of water cleans it up and brings out some sharper sweetness, still very huge and thick flavor

where can this scotch be purchased?  I am unable to find it online anywhere.
Interesting to read your thoughts. It wasn‚Äôt a favorite of mine. I found it hard to get past the heat, and didn‚Äôt feel like the PX integrated that well. Glad you enjoyed it!
Great review, I know this bottling divided opinions, but I really enjoyed it.
There's one on the whiskybase market and one in a liquor store in belgium from what i can see. North star only made 308 bottles so i guess that'll have to do. Both are marked up quite a bit above RRP just so you know.
This was bottled exclusively for The Whisky Barrel, an online store in England. They ship to the U.S. but its very expensive these days with the tariffs. Not even sure if this bottle is still available there.
I had a feeling you weren't going to like it as much as me haha. I agree on the sherry, but I really like that kind of profile with a mild sherry influence, lots of dark caramel and woody malt. It didnt feel too hot to me ar all, but maybe all the 60% bourbon I drink desensitized me.
Thanks! Yeah I could kind of see this being one that others might not like.
THANKS :-)
I‚Äôve never understood why, but somehow ABV hits me very differently with scotch than with bourbon. 60%+ bourbon can down easily, but 60%+ scotch almost never does.
No problem!

**Taste:** Sweet creamy caramel, werthers candy, sugary pastry, beautiful clean & shiny grassy malt, sweet vanilla, rich pear, very mild florals. The flavors and complexity are just beautiful here. The low ABV keeps it from being this thick rich punch of flavor. Instead, it's has a lightly sweet and delicate mouthfeel but the notes are so clean and precise. Delicious and fun 

**Finish:** Sweet creamy caramel, easy grassy malt, lingering richer butterscotch wood and even a hint of barrel char. Sweet and malty and delicious

****

* This is the lowest natural cask strength I've ever tried, and I really dig it. I'm not gonna say that it drinks way higher than it's abv or anything, drank blind I would guess this was a drinkable 46% at the very most. But it has a style that works very well. Delicate and light but with a nice creamy mouthfeel, flavor that is so clean and on point. That effortless balance and complexity that comes with age but presented in a light and drinkable way.

Yeah I dont think he could fault me for not adding water to this haha
Well, a little water might just bring that score up a bit... that said, it sounds delicious.
Lol. This is one of the most interesting Scotches I've had lately. I haven't dabbled very much in naturally low proof Scotch. I've also had some armagnac recently that was killer at 40-45% cask strength
Me neither but I like the concept of naturally lower proof, thicker flavors without the spirit being over oaked. Ok, time to look into some Armagnac and try to find some older, lower abv whisky. I love a quest.
If you seriously want to check out some armagnac, this is probably the best bottle and best value you can easily find right now. Selected by the afish group: https://www.finedrams.com/grosperrin-1996-bas-armagnac-aficionados-x-fine-drams.html

**Nose:** Soft, mellow, and malty. Crisp sweet honey, light caramel, rich velvety soft grassy malt, apple pie, soft wood, sweet pastry. Grassy malt that has been softened and well rounded with age

**Taste:**  Rich and malty in soft  and balnced way. Thick honey and caramel, sweet pastry, soft grassy malt, oily and malty mouthfeel, light floral honey and green apple. The notes are all kind of delicate but combine into a thick and oily mouthfeel. It just feels so aged and balanced 

**Finish:** Sweet floral notes and bright fruits pop on the palate, honey and vanilla icing, clean malt. Delicious sweet and malty rich finish but a bit too short

*****

* You can really taste the age on this. And it tastes very well aged too. Extremely soft and well balanced with a thick oily mouthfeel. The flavors are all delicious, but it could maybe use a little more ""pop"" to be truly epic. I especially wish the delicious malt was a little more up front and bold, it kind of all blends into a rich soft Scotchy experience. That's maybe more of a personal preference though and a minor complaint. Some water does help it come alive a little more and calms down the heat to where the notes are a little cleaner, but doesn't drastically improve it. Very good example of a rich well aged Scotch, especially for the price

**Taste:** Woody caramel, chocolate, thick and robust sulfury malt, dark sweet prune and red fruits, nutty sherry, mellow spice blast. Not super sweet in a fruity or wine way. Lots of caramel sweetness and malt, with a warm blanket of chocolatey wood and mellow dark fruits. Subdued, but thick and rich. Really nice stuff

**Finish:** Sweet dark caramel, warm fruits and spice build big, sweeter cherry and tropical fruits, vanilla and chocolatey wood. Lingering sweet spice. Complex and rich sweet finish

*****

* A beautiful dram, and it's not a full on sherry bomb. Lots of sulfury Craigellachie malt comes through with rich woody caramel, chocolatey and rich mellow sherry and brooding spice.

This one sounds like a lot of fun, thanks for reviewing it-- any similarity here to the 12yr DL Dailuaine from last year? I found that one also sherried but very distillate-driven, and thought it worked nicely.
Great review.  Wish I had a trip to CA planned.  I've been looking for an IB craigellachie with some age and this would do nicely.

For those put off by Sulfur, Craigellachie's sulfur style is intentionally in the distillate and is different than meat gone off sulfur or struck match sometimes found in sherry casks.  You might not like it but it contributes to the complexity.
For comparison I reviewed that Dailuaine [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/fj9p5r/review_134_dailuaine_12_old_particular_kl_sherry/).

Sounds like the Dailuaine had more sherry influence to me than this one. Could just be that Craigellachie's robust flavor stands out more. And ignore the scores I think I liked this Craigellachie as much or more than the Dailuaine from what I remember.
Thanks! Yeah if you're specifically looking for a nice Craigellachie with some characteristic feel this is a really nice one. Sorry you aren't able to get to Cali for some though"

**Elijah Craig Small Batch, Champagne's single barrel pick, 47% (done blind)**

**Nose:** There's sweet warm berry fruitiness, mild warming spice, earthiness and musty wood, smooth milk chocolate, vanilla. It's thick but toned down and muted.

**Taste:** Mellow and soft, but doesn't feel too watered down or low abv. Velvety mouthfeel of soft warm berry fruits, mildly bitter cacao, sweet vanilla, milk chocolate. Light and sweet and balanced, it's yummy. 

**Finish:** Vanilla and light candy-sweet berry, milk chocolate. Sweet and very pleasant

* Having trouble making any kind of guess here. It really felt like a light muted Bourbon at first, but now I'm thinking it's some kind of wine finished Scotch. Not a heavy handed wine influence, more subtle and balanced. Might be Port, feels chocolatey and sweet and super agreeable. ABV is difficult, it's soft and mellow and light but not in a washed out 40% way. Feels like 43-46% but with a nice rich mouthfeel. Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban?

*****

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** Well jeez I flopped on that one. I should have gone with my first instinct haha. What a mellow and fruity Bourbon though, very nice. A hint of spice on the nose but otherwise just tame and drinkable. Wow, this is good. Now that I know what it is the corn comes through more, but still no real spice.

I have 2 of these (not the pick you have, picks in general) and I think they are amazing values. I blinded one of them against EHT SB and I thought the EC store pick was more complex. I wasn‚Äôt trying to ‚Äúrate‚Äù them, just compare and contrast. Both of the picks I have have pretty pronounced fruit notes going on and, as you noted, don‚Äôt feel watered down tho I normally drink higher proofs. 

Cheers!
When I blind tasted small batch I was impressed with the fruitiness too as I also graded it right around where you did. I was blown away that it was Elian Craig and I think the store picks are some of the best values out there
I'm kind of in the same boat. I'm not big on the smoky notes so something comparable to an EC no less I thing might make a great stepping stone!
Sorry, this is all the info I have on it. It's from this bottle:

Scotch review #211

*****

**Cromarty's Firth (Dalmore) 2007 13 year blended malt, K&L Hepburn's Choice, refill hogshead, 53.6%**

**Nose:** Sweet barley malt, sweet spirity funk, lemon citrus, fruity apple, light vanilla, brine funk. Typical spirity and sweet malty refill barrel, nothing too special but not bad

**Taste:** Sweet and fruity, light vanilla, pop of sugary Barley maltiness, gentle caramel, mild ethanol and spice heat, dessert pastry, sweetly floral. Like the nose it delivers a very typical youngish malty refill barrel experience. But it's very well done, a little richer and sweeter and more flavorful than this style can often be. Lots of Barley maltiness and fruity/floral spirit. Sweet and light and crisp

**Finish:** Gritty caramel and spice heat, honey, dessert pastry and barley sugar. Nice sweet malty finish that is maybe just slightly rough around the edges

*****

* It definitely shows it's spirit-y refill barrel nature but it's well done here. Very nice stuff. Light and fruity with lots of sweet barley flavor, just some mild youthful ethanol and funk. It's pretty typical of many other youngish malty Highland/Speyside refill barrel IB's out there, but it's on the more balanced and rich side. 10-12 years can be quite rough and youthful for refill stuff like this I find, maybe going to 13 helped it out and gave it that extra boost. Nothing amazing but it's one of the better examples out there of a very common spirit-forward IB style.

Good to see what dalmore is supposed to look like before they change the color.
I love this. You and /u/madgraf are doing complementary K&L tastings simultaneously.
Does k&l ship?
Shockingly reasonable price for a Dalmore.  

There is a Duncan Taylor Dimensions 15 in my area at $350. I'm interested to try a Dalmore that hasn't been watered down tonthe bare minimum, but not that interested.  

Surprised there isn't alot of orange coming through as Dalmore is so linked to it.
Oh neat! I didn't even realize, total coincidence haha. I like madgrafs reviews, I'll have to check them out
Yes, but only within California
I'd suspect that has more to do with the usual sherry cask maturation and may not be evident in this kind of bottling.
Agree with u/thatfamousgrouse. Presumably oranges would come from the sherry cask maturation. This bottle appears to be bourbon cask."
"Review #453: Glengoyne 2008 11 year, K&L Old Particular PX finish, 56.3%",,https://i.redd.it/bpp6iywa2tc61.jpg,"Add some water
Read what David said. So I gave it another run - was going to let my bottle sit for a few months (my first take was similar to yours) but why not explore more with water now. Cause it's Friday night and everything is closed ;\_;

This does get more delicate and nuanced with water. The sour note mostly goes away. Light fruits, honey, malty sweetness. But you have to drown it. Definitely not what I'm looking for with Glengoyne. And the PX influence is still mostly evading me. Which is totally fine, but still would not recommend.

Scotch review #210

*****

**Glengoyne 2008 11 year, K&L Old Particular, PX finish, 56.3%**

**Nose:** Oh my it's a funky nose. Unpleasant sour funk, smells a lot like Baiju. Then there's floral honey, light caramel and malt, delicate orchard fruits, warm gentle wine. Nice fruity Scotch notes but they just can't overcome that awful sourness.

**Taste:** Sadly the taste is quite sour too. What is going on here. Strong Baiju-like sourness, then sweet fruity sherry slowly opens up. It's a nice delicate sherry flavor. With rich honey, rich fruity malt, light pastry, sweet delicate & warm plum fruit, sour grapes. There's some nice Scotchy flavor here and sweet delicate sherry but the sour Baiju note is too strong.

**Finish:** Much more pleasant on the finish finally, the floral and fruity malt notes come out with nice rich honey malt, spice, balanced and sweet.

*****

* This is a shame, there is some beautiful malty honey and lightly sweet sherry flavors here, but it's put off by this strong sour note. I would wonder about some kind of tainted bottle except I've heard similar things from a few others who tried a different bottle. It settles down with some air(especially the nose) but not enough. There's enough pleasant flavor here to keep it from being totally ruined I think, but I would still skip on this one

Your K&L Old Particular reviews have been fun reads. Some hits and misses. This one is bringing out some passionate comments about adding water. My take on it all is I add water when a bottle isn't working and that's really not very often. My ahah moment with adding water to a whisky was with a Blackadder 15 year old Tobermory, bourbon cask aged. I didn't like it, it was too tight, just odd and then I added a little water and then a little more. It just transformed into one of my favorites.  
Keep the reviews coming, they are enjoyable.
Hey there David! I didn't add any when I tried this, but I generally don't add water to cask strength spirits. For my tastes I don't know if it would have helped
Yep. Even though I didn't try water here, that's how it usually goes for me. If I'm not enjoying something or it has some kind of off-putting note, water never transforms it into something different and better. Water is better for calming down heat or exploring nuances of something I already enjoy. Sorry you aren't enjoying the bottle, but hopefully some air time is beneficial
That does sound weird and not really like Glengoyne's typical profile.
Thanks dude! Sounds like you and David og would get along well haha. I just don't find myself going with water a whole lot. And when it's an attempt to save something, it rarely works. But right on for you
Thanks for the reviews. I really appreciate it. I know we‚Äôve been through this here before. I just don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôd deprive yourself of the chance to enjoy this malt. I truly believe that you can‚Äôt appreciate cask strength single malt fully if you‚Äôre not willing to play a bit with water. This beverage is meant to be opened up with water, like a big red wine is meant to be decanted. 

I appreciate your commitment to this philosophy, but your only really half tasting it. Some malts work great at full strength and others don‚Äôt. Some fall apart with water, others improve exponentially. Many of our products come with disclaimers/recommendations that they should have between a few drops and a nice dollop of good spring water. 

I don‚Äôt presume to tell you what proof will be best for you, which is why we almost always bottle at cask strength, but I don‚Äôt sell these without strongly encouraging my customers to add water because it will taste better that way. Some days I‚Äôll prefer a malt right out of the bottle, others the same might feel right cut to 40 proof or anywhere in between. 

Not allowing yourself to experience how a malts changes with water is depriving yourself of a huge part of the enjoyment in my opinion. The old ‚ÄúRare Malts‚Äù Series from DCL recommended cutting those cask strength bottlings 2 parts water to 1 part whisky!! That‚Äôs a bit over the top, but it‚Äôs one of the beautiful aspects of cask strength whisky and I just can‚Äôt help myself but point out that you‚Äôre not allowing yourself to completely enjoy these malts if you militantly avoid adding water. This is all doubly true if you‚Äôre drinking younger whiskies. 

If you still don‚Äôt like it with a bit of water and some air please let us know but until then I feel obligated to mention for anyone with a bottle who might not realize that it could be significantly improved if one adheres to the customary rituals that are associated with this beverage. Likewise, whiskies that are gorgeous at cask strength should still be evaluated with water and time in glass to see how they develop so that we can understand how they‚Äôll change. 

I do appreciate your reviews and really love your notes, even when we have different opinions. I just wish we could hear your take on it after opening it up properly. Maybe you‚Äôll end up lowering your score and I‚Äôll be eating my words, but I do think this one does improve with water. What‚Äôs you‚Äôre reasoning behind not adding water?
On the bright side this profile will probably appeal to me on certain days. But yeah water didn't save this one for me.
Sounds nothing like Glengoyne. Glengoyne uses dynamite casks
Not sure I'd like that company.... water as a last resort.
Appreciate your thoughts on this, and the passion you clearly have for these picks. I should mention that I'm trying these from 2oz samples. I like trying them all, but I can't buy them all.

I agree that adding water can be good sometimes depending on the mood and the bottle. I just find that when I'm not enjoying something, water rarely helps. To me water is better for exploring something that I already like, or if I desire the profile of a certain bottle but am not in the mood for cask strength. Most of the time when I add water in an effort to improve something, it just doesnt work. The exception is when a spirit is too hot or spicy, then I find water can calm it down and let more notes emerge. But something like this glengoyne with more delicate flavors can often start to get a little washed out for me with water.

But to be fair you're right, I didnt give water a try here. If I had more of it I would experiment. Here's what I'll do: Since you feel so strongly about water with your store's picks, I'll try it in the future. I have a few more of these picks to go, and if I find myself not fully enjoying one of them at cask strength I'll give some water a try. I usually add about 1/2 tsp at a time so that I dont overdo it.
I don't water as well. I fully understand it may be better. 

That's just how I roll. I drink out of the can of beer. I can't be bothered to prep my Scotch. 
But, I do enjoy without water. I love cask strength.
I get where you‚Äôre coming from. Maybe the solution is to simply as one tiny drop to the last sip and let it open that way since you have so little to work with. I personally rarely find a young malt that water won‚Äôt improve, but I also always play with it from 1-2 drops to about 50/50 to get a sense of how it will changes. It wouldn‚Äôt be too tough to sequester .5 oz to experiment a bit but I see why having less makes you apprehensive to adding water. In any case I really appreciate you hearing where I‚Äôm coming from on this fact and I look forward to all your future reviews. I wish there was a way I could legally provide samples but California is very strict about that stuff. Very annoying state to sell booze in some times.
You do you man. I just think if y‚Äôall are going to hit everybody up about your take on a certain drink you should give the whisky a fair shake. Just my point of view. Or reviews should come with a disclaimer, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt water, while fully understanding that it may be better.‚Äù"

*****

**Hebridean Mulligan (Ledaig) 1997 23 year blended malt, K&L Old Malt Cask, hogshead, 59%**

**Nose:** Rich floral peat, toffee, chocolate, fresh mint, toasted wood, spices, mellow tobacco, sweet vanilla, nice smokiness. Beautiful complex smoky nose. The smoke is rich but it's evenly balanced and gentle with lots of nice chocolatey and floral notes

**Taste:** Very nice mouthfeel, rich and complex. Rich caramel and clean toasted wood, lots of milk chocolate, balanced smoke, creamy vanilla and fruits. Chocolatey and sweet with gentle smoke, very balanced and complex. Not a peat bomb at all, age has definitely tamed the smoke. But it integrates very well with the sweet barrel notes, whole thing is friendly and drinkable

**Finish:** Sweet vanilla and brighter berry fruits, gentle chocolatey smoke, light menthol char. Sweet delicious finish

*****

* A very nice example of a well aged peated Scotch. The smoke has definitely been tamed with age, so if you're looking for a peat monster go younger. But there's some beautiful barrel influence here and it all balances together so nicely. Gentle chocolatey sweet smoke, rich but very friendly and drinkable. It's not hot at all considering the higher abv actually. I might have guessed 50-55% blind

**Nose:** Luxurious caramel, creamy butterscotch, smooth sweet grape and cherry, sweet buttery rich toasted wood, vanilla, orange cream. Smooth and creamy and thick, fucking great

**Taste:** Bright orange caramel, sweet pop of cherry and smooth happy grape, very mild tartness, thick rich caramel builds big, vanilla dessert cream, creamy butterscotch, clean lightly toasted wood. So sweet, but it's well balanced sweet creamy wood notes and smooth sweet fruits. Not overly sweet in a wine-y or sugary way, still thick and rich. Wood is mild, more butterscotch and caramel and vanilla than anything woody or tannic. Just amazing

**Finish:** The sweet happy grape gets brighter and a little more tart, bright caramel and creamy wood

*****

* What a fantastic Armagnac and what a fantastic spirit. This was one of my very first bottles of yak, and I can see exactly how it made me fall so hard for the stuff. This one is very caramel and butterscotch rich, lots of creamy thick sweetness and happy smooth fruitiness. So complex and flavorful, just a pure delight. This is exactly why I love spirits so much.

Del Cassou has been one of my favorites of the L'Encantada bottlings I've had (along with La Freche). I have a 1992 from Fine Drams and a 1987 from PM Spirits, both are excellent. I wish stuff like this wasn't so rare over here. (I envy folks who can shop at K&L, no shipping to TX).
Is this by chance [https://www.finedrams.com/lencantada-domaine-del-cassou-1987-armagnac-cask-10.html](https://www.finedrams.com/lencantada-domaine-del-cassou-1987-armagnac-cask-10.html) ?   The labels look different; I know it may be a different release from the same barrel.
Thanks for the review! Looks like a great one.
I've had 2 other Cassous that were both excellent, yeah I'm a fan too. And Le Freche is some of my absolute favorite yak. We are definitely spoiled here in California with K&L Wine haha. Texas manages to get some pretty good stuff too though from what I hear
No this review is for cask #14 which is an older bottling, that Cassou 1987 on FineDrams is cask #10. If you're looking for a review of it, you're in luck because I just reviewed it a few days ago along with a bunch of other Encantadas from FineDrams: https://www.reddit.com/r/Armagnac/comments/qyhnfs/review_614_lencantada_del_cassou_10_1987_486/
I appreciate it, and all your reviews. I just bought a bottle of the L'Encantada Domaine del Cassou 1998 (Cask #43). 

The Pibous 1994 that just released through PM Spirits was insanely good.

**Taste:** Big blast of cinnamon and delicious spice with big Rye flavor, hot cherry, caramel, bready dessert pastry, clean sweet wood, brash sweet spice. Delicious Rye spice kick, grain forward Rye flavor with fantastic complexity and balance.

**Finish:** Long finish of cinnamon spice and sweet breadiness, caramel, sweet wood, clean and sharp Rye grain

*****

* Another delicious Rye, all four of these have been winners. Like #3 it's a bit more spicy and brash compared to the first 2 and it works really well. Stays balanced and complex with excellent Rye flavor. As a Rye fiend these are such a delight. Mild sweet wood influence that lets the big clean Rye grain really shine. There's talk of these being aged in old tired/refill barrels, and tasting them I can totally see it being true. But with the age on these I don't think it's a bad thing. They've turned out great, like a well aged malty Scotch in how the Grain is front and center. 20201(#2) was my favorite, with 20200(#1) being a close second. 20209(#3) and this one are on equal ground in 3rd/4th place.

* Nose is similar to the last two, thick clean Rye that is sweet and grain forward. But then the flavor explodes more brash and hot than the other two so far. Spirity and grain forward in a lively, floral, and spicy way. I loved those others but this style also works really well here. A really great brash and spicy Rye with delicious sweetness.

Yes that is the store, but like the others said this is long gone. All 4 of these sold out really quick

**Taste:** Caramel, thick minty Rye builds huge, toffee, thick mellow Rye spice, sweet toasted wood, cherry, gritty graham cracker richness. Thick and robust Rye grain, nice full mouthfeel that is creamy and balanced with lots of sweet caramel wood notes.

**Finish:** Big Rye finish. Sweet cherry and caramel, thick minty Rye, very long sweet and heavy Rye finish with lingering gentle rye spice. 

*****

* After #1 this another beautiful Rye. Thick heavy Rye character, rich and balanced with huge flavor. This one is less spicy, more candy cherry sweetness rather than the sharper green apple of the previous barrel. Thicker Rye and richer oak influence than #1, but like that one it's still a lot less oak than you would expect for the age. It shows up as sweet caramel and toffee. So I think the refill barrel theory(see review #1) still holds up here. But once again the light wood influence really lets the Rye grain shine and with the age it all comes together perfectly

Awesome review, I've got one of these waiting at will call I'm gonna pick up this week and it sounds like I'm in for a treat!

I'm curious about this refill barrel theory, do you have any more info on that? My understanding was that anything labeled as *straight rye whiskey* being sold in the US has the same new charred oak barrel requirements as bourbon, regardless of where the whiskey was distilled. Am I mistaken in that in general or is it because this is sourced from Canada that the whiskey didn't have to be aged in new oak?
Hot damn you definitely loved that one. Now I gotta go back to it haha. This and 20200 stood out to me so i totally get it.
Unfortunately WhistlePig is known for inaccurate and incorrect labels. They seem to just have their standard Single Barrel labels and put them on everything no matter what. For example there's many cases of Indiana MGP Rye still being labelled as Canadian. Combine that with Canada's lack of any real rules like America has for its Whiskey, and it's anyone's guess what is actually in the bottle. It just tends to be great stuff so we don't worry about it a whole lot haha.
Yeah, Whistlepig has flouted the rule (and been as untransparent as possible) in terms of the rebarreling that happens when distillate reaches VT. I think the current attempt to have the label not be egregiously wrong is saying ‚Äústraight rye finished in VT oak‚Äù or something to that effect, as the canadian distillate is all rebarreled. That said, just by character, it‚Äôs pretty easy to tell that it initially saw good time in new oak. Something like Barrell‚Äôs SiC ryes are a good example of something that has not.
Yeah I did. I loved it on the first ounce pour, but it got even better on the 2nd ounce I think. Much richer."

**Nose:** Clean Rye grain with herbs and dill, strong and sharp but mellow. Butterscotch, sweet balanced wood, graham cracker, big minty Rye spice, bright crisp green apple fruitiness. Rich and balanced and grain forward, big Rye nose.

**Taste:** Bright clean Rye, crisp and sweet green apple, peppery spice, sweet caramel wood, butterscotch, sweet dessert vanilla. Sweet and crisp and mildly brash, all comes together in a big balanced way. Just delicious

**Finish:** Big delicious kick of sweet spice-y Rye, black cherry, zingy spice, sweet grain. A long sweet spicy Rye finish

*****

* This is excellent. Not very woody at all considering the age. It's grain forward with big Rye flavor, bright and sweet but incredibly balanced, with just enough brash spice to give a nice spice kick. Word has it these super old barrels popping up lately is Canadian stuff aged in tired old refill barrels. I can definitely see that being the case considering the lack of oak, but the thing is it's working really well here. It's possible this wouldn't have been very good at 10 years, but at 17.5 it's come together nicely. Like a well aged malty Scotch almost, has great complexity and rich flavor presented in an effortlessly balanced way that showcases the grain. Interesting stuff

There SiB Cask Strength program is insane but heavily slept on by the whiskey community imo.
Just got a 15 year single barrel pick 105.3 proof and I'm excited to try it. Never had whistlepig but I figured 80 bucks for a 15 year rye was too good to pass up
Dude, I have that same poster!
We also had a local pick barreled in March '03 and 17 years old. I've had a few delicious WP10 picks and the recent older picks are delicious! I was told they are some of the last of their older Alberta rye barrels.
Sorry if this is a stupid question, but how are you all getting these small tester bottles rather than buying a full bottle?
Just picked up this exact bottle from K&L yesterday. Is it much oakier than the normal store picks? 17.5 years seems like a lot of time in a barrel.
Great review my friend! Sounds delicious
OP please tell me where you got that awesome drinking chimpanzee poster. I need that for my home bar!
My county ABC here in NC recently got their own WP 10 store pick, a 16 year old barrel at a fairly soft 104.8 proof.

I've held off cracking the seal so far but these reviews of similar barrels are making it more and more difficult
Agreed that this is like a well aged scotch in terms of complexity. I was hesitant but grabbed a 15.5 year that is up there with the best WP picks I‚Äôve grabbed over the past 4 years.
This one was my favorite I think.
$80 is a steal for 15 year WP. I have a 10 year WP store pick that is 112.9 proof. Purchase price was $90. So good I purchased a second bottle.
$80 is a great price, I never see that price on these anymore. Usually more like $90-$100. Hope you enjoy it
A man of culture
No problem, I got this from a friend who bought the bottle. Some of us just share these among friends
Read the review haha. Not very oaky at all, I suspect this was a tired or refilled barrel but I think it works well
Thanks dude!
I think if you just google ""drinking monkey poster"" you can find it
Yeah sounds similar. Hopefully the age on that works as well as it did on these. I've had some really good NC picks before
That's great! What kind of bottling is it? A 10 year Single Barrel that's actually older than the sticker age, like this one?
I'm still doing a round 2 of the rest, but so far I think this and #20201 are my favorites. Spoiler alert, they're all really good
A lot of store picks for 10 years are older than they state.
Oops, missed the closing paragraph
Not OP, but I have a 17 yo club pick labeled as 10. Very similar to what you observe - big flavor but not the over-oaked that older ryes can get. I assumed it had something to do with aging in cooler climates, but your refill barrel remark makes a lot of sense. 

Wish I could have bought a second bottle of this one.
Yep, 10 year label but 15.5 years per the spirits buyer who picked it. Just released in November around the time 5+ barrels of similar ages dropped locally. Plenty still on the shelves so I might end up trying a few others!"

Brandy review #22

*****

**Scotch Malt Whisky Society, Armagnac Single Cask, A5.1 ""Fruit Shop Raid,"" 61.3%**

**Nose:** Big sticky sweet caramel, green apple, cherry, subtle grape, menthol spice. A lot of luscious caramel and cool menthol spice with mellow inviting fruit. Some water really brings out a fresh and pleasant fruitiness of grape and pear

**Taste:** Wow it's hot lol. Hot cherry and spice, cinnamon red hots, sweet caramel. There's some grape hiding behind all the spice and hot sweetness, but it's mostly very spicy and Bourbon-y. Not surprising at the abv I guess. After adding some water, it helps this a lot. Brings the heat and spice way down, creates a balanced kind of sweet caramel and pleasant fruitiness with a more friendly cinnamon spice kick. 

**Finish:** Spice builds huge and hot, cinnamon, hot minty spice, cherry cough syrup, grape, clove. It clears out your sinus in a sweet holiday spice kind of way. With water it's still a very spice-y finish but it stays mellow and balanced with the fruits

*****

It's a really unique experience for sure. Definitely the hottest Armagnac I've had, it assaults you with a wide range of complex spice notes. It's almost like a hot Bourbon. The grape doesn't jump out at you but it's there, and it's still fruitier than a Bourbon with more holiday clove and cinnamon type spice in here. 

With water added, it's a whole different story. Balanced and fruity with a mellow and complex spice layer. You can even experiment with diferent amounts of water for how big of a spice layer you want to keep. This is the rare spirit for me that is improved by water and drinks better with it. I think this stuff really needs water to fully enjoy it. Still an odd name though, I don't find this to be a super fruity yak. Unless the ""raid"" implies the fruit is gone because the shop was robbed.

"Review #445: Buffalo Trace White Dog mash #1, 62.5%",,https://i.redd.it/xa8wfj50q5961.jpg,"Tried it at the distillery. Then our tour guide told us to put it on our hands and rub them together. Don‚Äôt remember why lol
This is the unaged Spirit from Buffalo Trace's mashbill #1, right off the still and cut down to a barreling strength of 125 proof. This is the mashbill that is used to make stuff such as Buffalo Trace, Eagle Rare, Colonel E.H. Taylor, Stagg and Stagg Jr.

Bourbon Review #193

*****

**Buffalo Trace White Dog mash #1, 62.5%**

**Nose:** Funky and spirity. Funky candy corn, sweet corn, vanilla cream, smelly feet. A clean sharp sweetness. Just think of how funky a candy corn flavored drink might smell, that's how funky this is

**Taste:** Sweet vanilla cream, banana funk, big funky candy corn, sweet Bourbony corn, green apple, plenty of hot burn. Has a thick and creamy sweet mouthfeel but with tons of zany sharp funk and heat. It's somewhat balanced for what it is, I've had young Whiskies with more offensive spirit-y ethanol than this. The ethanol tends to taste more thin and harsh when it shows up unwanted in a young Bourbon

**Finish:** Not really a finish, just continues with the same thick funky-sweet  flavors. Big corn funk, sweet vanilla and dessert cream, harsh green apple and building heat

*****

* I can't say it's terribly enjoyable, but it's interesting. Crazy how funky and wild it is, lot's of candy corn and banana and b.o. type notes. And drinking it sbs with some mash #1 Bourbon (Buffalo Trace and Stagg jr), it's crazy how much gets tamed by wood and oxygen over the years. The sweetness carries over a lot, and that corn flavor is still there but the funk gets smoothed out like a jagged rock being smoothed by erosion. Interesting to see the raw material that Bourbon is sculpted from, and how much flavor is added from the wood. Kinda hard to score this
Would be interesting to use in a project with your own oak barrel
Thank for reviewing it.  I bought a bottle about 5 years ago and I thought it was interesting.  But I don‚Äôt ever need to try it again.  Cheers!
It‚Äôs incredibly selfish of me, but I wish BT would stop selling these bottles and actually make more BT so I can go from a 2% chance of getting a bottle to a 4% chance. 

Unless this is just leftover mash that they aren‚Äôt able to age for whatever reason, then my point is invalid. Either way, I despise North Carolina‚Äôs liquor laws and distribution.
I‚Äôm a noob in all of this...when you say this is the mash bill for all those different bourbons, what differentiates them? Is it just aging time? Or is there something more? If it‚Äôs just aging, could I get a charred oak barrel and turn some buffalo trace into stagg? This is probably a ridiculous question but I have no idea.
Was it funky at all?
This guy funks
I use this with a lemonade or apple cider mixer. Highly enjoyable throw a shot or 2 into a big glass. Whenever we go to Lexington we always stop by the distillery and pick up a bottle or 2.
I have a bottle I bought years ago and every time I smell it, I get buttered movie theatre popcorn.
62.5%? Is this bottle barrel proof? ^^^^/s
I have that same poster!
I had that poster in college!!
I wasn‚Äôt aware this was supposed to be drank... I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs good with peach tea?
I always liked White Dog, but I haven‚Äôt had it in years. It sort of reminded me of grappa a bit.
This stuff is gasoline. No bueno
Maker‚Äôs is far superior in my opinion, great flavor, not as strong as the BT. 
Kill myself for not getting more when I was at the distillery.
Probably for the aroma, I've seen similar with mezcal. Although mezcal smells a little nicer than this stuff. Also, username checks out
Few years ago I had Freddie as our tour guide. He's awesome. Had us do this and explained each step. If I remember correctly:

First slap and rub was to get an idea of proof. If it smells strong it is

Second was for the main grain. Smells like corn, so you can assume corn is the main grain.

Third smelled like bread, so you get the yeast.

You're left with the oils on your hand.
Check out the documentary on hulu called ""Neat"". It's pretty damn good
i think its something to do with evaporating the alcohol and leaving the oils on your hands so you can get a better idea of how it smells
[I'm assuming it was this](https://youtu.be/_zN_lJGh-s0)
Hand sanitizer
Buffalo Trace was one of the best tours next to Woodford.
They put it in your hands to rub together to create some heat and then they ask you to cup your hand and smell the aroma to see what you could scents you could pickup.
Sanitiser
Bro this shit sounds mad funky
I bought a bottle of this at Makers Mark they call White Lightning. I wouldn‚Äôt drink it for fun but it was interesting.
This is what shine tastes like out of the still.
In my experience it doesn‚Äôt work that well with the small barrels you can buy. They‚Äôre really good for finishing liquors with different flavors (I port finished a bourbon that came out super tasty) but they do really poor with ‚Äúaging‚Äù liquor. There‚Äôs just too much barrel contact and you over oak it before any true flavors develop
I toasted some cherry wood chips and dropped it in a mason jar with the white dog back on 12/19. My plan is to let it go for 6 weeks, temper it down with some water. Maybe I‚Äôll do a review
Those small barrels aren‚Äôt really great for that.  Now aging a cocktail can yield some nice results with those things.
That‚Äôs what I was thinking
Yeah I know what you mean haha. It's mostly an educational oddity. I've had this for a year or two and I drank more for this review than I ever did in the whole time I've had it
Ditto. I really like Buffalo trace, it just isn‚Äôt accessible in NC. I was in the ABC store today and saw they had White Dog. It was only $14 with tax so I said why not?
In case you didn't know there is *some* hope: Buffalo Trace distillery has been undergoing massive renovations for a few years now to increase production, and building massive new warehouses to store more aging stock. The problem is that Whiskey has to age, so it will be several years before we see this increased output come to market. And even that is hoping that demand hasn't increased enough to gobble it all up same way it gets gobbled up now. But yeah I'm with you I wish some of this stuff was easier to find and enjoy right now
No problem, it's pretty interesting and more complex than a lot of people realize. 

Age is a part of it. Colonel E.H. Taylor is 4 years old, Eagle Rare is 10, Stagg jr is somewhere between those, and Stagg is usually the oldest of the lot. Another big part of it is how the barrels are aged. The rickhouses where barrels are stored and aged are several stories tall, with different conditions at different levels. The top levels get hotter and experience wider temperature variations vs the bottom where things are a little cooler and more stable. Over the years these differences effect how the barrel ""breathes"" and how the Bourbon interacts with the wood creating different flavor profiles. Also, before they even barrel the stuff there's different levels of char they put on the new oak barrels. You can also get into different barrel entry proofs, but as far as I know Buffalo Trace fills everything at the legal maximum of 62.5%. All these factors can be combined in different ways to achieve different flavor profiles on the same stuff.
There are all sorts of variables that differentiate bourbons beyond mashbill. Aging, barrel char, batch size, filtering, proof, and place in the warehouse all factor in. Buffalo Trace is proofed down, chill filtered, and sourced from barrels across multiple warehouses. George T Stagg is aged, barrel proof, non chill filtered, and sourced from a smaller selection of barrels (likely at the top floor of a warehouse).
So funky
HELL YES ME TOO!!!
""Barreling proof"" would be more accurate than ""barrel proof,"" since there's no barrel involved here yet.

It comes off the stills higher than this and is then cut down to 62.5%, which is considered a good strength to barrel Whiskey at for wood interaction. It's also the maximum legal barreling proof for Bourbon
That they bottled it and sell it for $20 per 375ml is in itself an indictment on us as a consumer base...
They show this in the neat documentary. Can confirm

Edit:Neat not near
Exactly that. Someone else posted a video of the experience. Made me wish I was back there
I had Freddie to!
Freddie is definitely the man. If you‚Äôre going to book a tour there, ask for him. He knows where all the bodies are buried.
Ah yep that was it. Thanks for the flashback.
Thanks!
Yeah man Woodford was fucking beautiful, I went in April and it was all rolling green hills and stone buildings, can‚Äôt wait to go back again.  Not the mention the insanely cool copper stills!
The angel's share with those small barrels is also very very high
Information like this is why I love reddit
I hadn‚Äôt thought of that!
What if you had a barrel with only a few charred oak staves and the rest were non-reactive, non-porous plastic (like ptfe)? Less oak surface area and less porous so you lose less over time? Would something like that work?
You can get little stave things that you can put in the bottle to ""age"" it.  But I also just bought it for the oddity to work on picking out flavors from the mash and what comes from the barrel.
It can be done if you use the proper conversion... a few months is equal to a few years if I remember right... leave it too long and you‚Äôll have nothing left
This is the way we do it with our moonshine.  
Those 1L barrels evaporate too fast. Instead, get some old barrel staves from ex-bourbon casks. Run them through a planer to take the alligator scale off the inside and the garbage off the outside. Then, cut to 1"" wide by 6"" long sticks. Toast them in a toaster over on high for a couple hours until you can't stand the smoke anymore. Drop one stick into each mason jar. Works like a charm.
I hope u have before n after pictures.  I‚Äôd be interested in your project/ results
What are some examples?
Any chance you could pour it in one of those mini barrels I see posted on here from time to time and just wait five to ten years to see if it‚Äôs amazing?
Now that I think about it, I did read about them expanding. Makes sense that it‚Äôll take some time. 

I don‚Äôt have any hope for NC being able to distribute it with any common sense though. BT could make a billion barrels and none of it will make it to the consumer in NC because of screwed up laws and hoarding by the state ABC board. Guess I‚Äôm just going to have to move to another state.
EH Taylor is only 4 years old?? No way
That's fascinating, and I didn't know that there was a maximum legal barreling proof. I'm still going to lower the /s down by a few meters though.
They have a documentary?
Interesting idea. Theoretically it seems like it would work since there‚Äôs less oak surface. I haven‚Äôt taken mine apart for cleaning yet so I‚Äôm not sure how easy the stave replacement would be though.
The before pic is just a bottle of Buffalo Trace White Dog mash #1
Negroni, manhattan are the 2 you see most in restaurants.. whenever we can do that again
Boulevardier and Negroni are two of my favorites. I only allow 3 weeks tops in the barrel and am careful to rotate every few days.   The barrel is pretty much shot after 3 batches.
They're decent for barrel finishing, too. You won't make yourself a Midwinter Night's Dram or Dovetail, but if you condition the barrel right and taste it daily (small barrels work in units of days, not months/years) you could get something that's actually enjoyable.

At the end of the day, though, they're mostly a gimmick. While you can impart some good oaky flavor (and over oak *really* easily) you won't mellow a spirit the way that years in a barrel will, so a white dog product would still taste harsh.
I was thinking the same thing.  Those barrels are about $30, and this is about $20ish dollars so maybe it‚Äôs be a worthwhile investment.  It‚Äôs how whiskey is made, so I think it should work out ok.  The smaller barrel should make aging a little faster than large barrels as well, so maybe 2-3 years.
That‚Äôs the best option tbh... my buddy got a mini barrel from BT and i helped him find a bunch of mash #1 and Rye Mash to fill it... eager to start tastings of the finished product
But you definitely don‚Äôt wanna let it sit very long... the smaller the barrel, the less time to age... few months at best.. our goal is to start sampling it after a couple months until it has the right taste
Well to be fair I'm not 100% sure on that and you could be right. It's bottled in bond meaning that it has to be from one distilling season and aged a minimum of four years. Many Bottled in Bond Bourbons are 4 years old, but they can certainly be older such as Henry McKenna
[Neat](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt7109844/), it's on hulu
And I have laid my king down on the board, and am now leaving the table
I've heard 7-10 years but I have no idea. It doesn't taste young at all IMO
It‚Äôs so well done, too!

Bourbon Review #192

*****

**Russells's Reserve Single Barrel, Ace Spirits #20-0648, 55%**

**Nose:** Stale funky wood, mild green apple and fruitiness, caramel, corn, vanilla, sweet bakery and wood notes. Light and sweet, with an unappealing stale note that's almost sour

**Taste:** Sweet toasted wood and spice, funky corn, green apple, light caramel, sweet wood spice. It's light and sweet, almost spirity even. Better than the nose luckily, but still a bit uneventful overall. The sweet notes work well but the caramel and wood which is usually a rich delicious part of these just feels washed out

**Finish:** Hot spice, sweet corn and light caramel. lingering sweet light wood

*****

* I usually consider these a pretty safe bet, but this one is disappointing. It's not completely terrible. Basically enjoyable (even if a bit uneventful) but there's some off notes lurking on the edge of the nose and palate that detract from the experience. I'm from California and don't have a lot of experience with Ace spirits but I know they are a big name that does a lot of picks so I was expecting better

This year's rickhouse E RRSiB selections are oddballs. I have one from LA that you'd swear was distilled by Dickel. Proof them down to 101 and they're nicer from my experience.
Too bad that bottle isn‚Äôt up to your tastes. I can‚Äôt attest to Ace‚Äôs picks, but the one time I went in there, the lack of customer service just turned me off and I left empty-handed. I have a Total wine RR pick that‚Äôs delicious and have been taking more chances on their picks and my local store‚Äôs picks. I hope that you find another one you like anyway!
I sent a bottle from this barrel as a gift to a relative who's into bourbon/scotch.  I had not tasted it, but just purchased it off the Ace Spirits website.  He was not very complimentary about it.  I suggested he drink it down a bit and let it sit closed for a couple of months, then go back to it.  He said that did not help.   Hmmm.
Bummer. I have a couple of buddies from that area who say that Ace isn‚Äôt what it used to be with picks. Don‚Äôt know If yours is more recent or not.
Interesting. I don't usually add water, but I'll give it a try with this one. Some others have commented cork taint as a possibility
No worries, I have other ones that I've enjoyed a lot more. Like I said I generally enjoy these a lot this is just a dud. I've had good experiences with TW picks before, glad you skipped Ace and got a good one
Ok two things: One, I'm strangely relieved it's not just me with this barrel. It just tastes off. And two, I hope you can appreciate the honesty of that relative. They could easily just lie and say it's good. But in the future, when they like a gift you will know that they actually mean it
Ha I almost said it's from this year, but it's from 2020. So pretty recent. Happy new year
I have run a few picks through Ace and while I have had a couple picks from them I really enjoy the picks I have selected. They have changed ownership recently and I am not a fan of the new ownership to an extent. I'm really excited for my Woodford reserve double oaked selection to come in.
I live in Minneapolis, and currently have six different Ace Spirits picks on my shelf, most are from 2020 and all are excellent. I didn't buy this particular bottle though, I already have seven different Russell's picks.
Doubt it. E is just wacky this year.
That‚Äôs fair and I am glad to hear it. Thanks a lot, cheers!
You too!
The ownership change is what irked my friends as well.
Good to hear. May just be grouchy ‚Äúget off my lawn‚Äù sentiments from my friends who are long time drinkers/collectors. I am guilty of the same.
May I ask what picks you have picked up? Curious if you have run across a pick I have selected
I feel like you and I had this same convo on a past thread. I do feel like they‚Äôve taken a slight step back from when Louis was running the show. More importantly though...they and others need to get back to running out consistent 4R SiB picks! Minneapolis has been slipping on the 4R picks in the last year or two and it‚Äôs a bummer.
Now I'm glad all the Picks I've had past year including Total Wines were rickhouse F lol. Delicious
From Ace Spirits I have a Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit, Remus Cask Strength, Old Forester Barrel Strength, Four Roses OESK (2018) and a Maker's Mark Private Select (2018).
I got one 4R pick this year, and it was from Total Wine. That is the only 4R pick I saw in Minnesota this year. I don't claim to know what is going on with barrel programs, but I'm assuming that there is a huge demand for picks right now.  

I also agree that Louis retiring is a loss. He was picking stellar barrels for years when no one gave a shit and he had great relationships in the whiskey world, giving him access to some unicorns. I didn't get a bottle of that 13yr 4R pick they came across, but a friend of mine did and I was happy to at least get a pour of it.
Something to be said for variety, though.
None of my picks. I had a knob Creek pick and a Balcones single malt. Soon should have a Woodford double oaked pick dropping sometime in the next month or so."

Brandy review #21

*****

**Grosperrin 1996 afish pick, 53.1%**

**Nose:** Smooth grape, velvety thick chocolate, leather, coffee, mellow tart berry, rich smooth oak, toasted biscotti, fruity coffee. Thick chocolatey and toasted nose with rich mellow fruit

**Taste:** Rich chocolate, leather, toasty toasty toasted wood, mild tobacco, a core of smooth warm grape fruitiness, vanilla, dark chocolatey oak, coffee. It's chocolatey and oaky, mildly tannic but it's just enough to be interesting while staying friendly. It's like chocolate covered raisins and coffee aged in toasted wood

**Finish:** The sweet mellow fruits brighten up with grape and dark tart berry, rich milk chocolate, mild tannic bite, gentle wood spice, vanilla. Sweet and mellow wood finish

*****

* Delicious and super drinkable. I like this style with dark chocolatey and tannic wood but presented in a friendly, smoothly thick way. It's like mellow sweet fruits enveloped in rich chocolatey wood. No real spice heat and very little bitterness, just all the best parts of a darker wood influence

This shit is legit good.
I love the musty coffee and dark fruit notes in this. They sure did pick a good one!
Thanks for the review. This afish pick was a great one to me! It has every element of what I long for in a yak, and all in the correct proportion to create a harmonious balance. It is simply a joy to drink and savor. Your review and conclusion are right on point.
This is one of the best yaks I've ever had. Delicious stuff. Great pick by the Afish team.
Nice review, sounds yummy.  

It took over 7 weeks (gotta love USPS), but my shipment finally arrived on my doorstep today. Looking forward to trying this tonight.
Where does one get one of these? Available online?
Late to the game and planning to scoop this up with a haul. Does this feature rancio notes?

Been awhile since I had killer armagnac and this sounds like it fits the bill
Agreed, and even with shipping from Europe it's a great price
How was it?
You can get this on FineDrams.com. Ships from Europe, it's very reasonable shipping prices and they will send to anywhere in the U.S.
No problem! I poured a little to get a better idea. If by rancio notes you mean a slightly bitter/soy sauce/mushroom kind of thing, it has it a little especially on the nose. But it's not heavy and it's balanced out well by the fruit and more rich chocolatey wood notes. If you like Armagnac at all I don't think you will be disappointed
Yep those notes, I describe it sometimes as a musty basement and/or forest floor.

Long ago I had a Chateau de Castex 21yr which went overboard on rancio. This sounds right up my alley. Thanks!
Sure thing, any time! This isn't overboard at all to me. It's like chocolatey raspberry in a glass, but it's very complex and hits on a little bit of everything that I love about Armagnac. 

Also, if you like peated Scotch the r/Scotch Ballechin is on FineDrams now. I haven't had it myself yet but I'll bet it's good

Confused about accessing old saves/switching to uvhm on PS3,"I just played through on PS3, and when it asked me if I wanted to play on uvhm I selected ""no"" so I could do some DLC's first. I didn't realize about the level cap, so at level 39 I decided to go back to uvhm. I couldn't find the option anywhere, and I started a new game thinking it might give me the option. It didn't, and now my old level 39 game seems to be gone. Can I re-access my old game and switch it to uvhm at all?

**EDIT:** Figured it out",https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands2/comments/kodprg/confused_about_accessing_old_savesswitching_to/,"There are 3 modes, the normal mode (lv1-lv30) the true mode (lv30-lv50) and the ultimate mode (lv50-max lvl). 

So you are talking about the true mode. Now to select a mode, you‚Äòll have to go to character selection menu. Select the character you want to switch modes with and then it‚Äòll ask you which mode you want to play and you can select between all modes you have unlocked for the character
True mode, gotcha sorry about that. 

So I'm selecting Commando, which is who I beat the game with before and played some DLC with. I hit New Game, and it just starts the game. It never asks what mode I want to play. I'm walking around with claptrap in the very beginning, does it ask me later?
You press triangle to go to your character selection menu, then you select the character and it‚Äòll ask you which mode. After you selected true mode, you can just press continue and will start the true mode. 

If you press ‚Äûnew game‚Äú it will just create a new lv1 character and start a new game, but you don‚Äòt want to start a new character, you want to start the true mode on your existing character
Oh I found it! I was in that menu, but I was glazing over the ""existing charcacter"" option at the very top for some reason, only saw ""create new..."" and was worried I lost my character. 

Thank you so much for the help!"
"Review #442: Pouchegu 1981 39 year ""Rare Armagnac Collection,"" 53.7%",,https://i.redd.it/zht5dew90n861.jpg,"Brandy Review #20

*****

**Domaine de Pouchegu 1981 39 year, Rare Armagnac Collection, 53.7%**

**Nose:** Deep dark chocolatey fruits, raisin and smooth dark plum, black cherry syrup, bitter chocolate, vanilla, tons of smooth darkly toasted wood, a strong mellow undercurrent of anise spice. It's mega dark and dense, but all balances together elegantly and smoothly

**Taste:** Really nice mouthfeel. Not a big blast of flavor, it's rich and silky smooth with dense dark flavor that slooowly unfolds and builds. Strawberry and grape sweetness enveloped in milk chocolate, dark smooth toasted wood, vanilla. It has a silky smooth darkness. Not the most complex stuff but it's dense with flavor and very elegant. If anything it drinks light despite the proof.

**Finish:** Finish is darkly bright if that makes sense. Builds to a sweet blast of tart grape and chocolate, smooths out into rich dark chocolatey wood, vanilla, vague fruity warmth and mellow spice. 

*****

* Fantastic bottle, extremely well aged. Rather than being super complex it's densely packed with rich flavor of dark stewed fruits and chocolatey wood, but it all balances in an impossibly smooth and silky way. If anything it almost drinks a little too light. If I'm being honest I kind of prefer the more dramatic and punchy fruity yaks, but this is a perfect bottle for that smooth & elegant kind of mood.

Score: **8**

That sweet blast of tart grapes on the finish is like a mix of estery grape soda and balsamic vinegar. It‚Äôs a strange note for me and took away from the experience a bit. Otherwise this was a nice bottle at a fantastic price. I love the density of dark, rich flavors.
u/Buckydean do you have a blog or presence elsewhere? You seem like a Spirits Sensei.
I don‚Äôt usually add water to Armagnac but with these old Pouchegu releases it‚Äôs been a revelational change.
I have gotten that balsamic note on super dark yaks before, I don't think I quite got that here. But I can totally see that, I'll look for it next time I sip some. Agreed it's a very nice price on such a great bottle.
Ha that's very flattering, but no I don't. I just post here on Reddit for fun. Thanks for reading, and I'm glad you enjoyed it!
If you ever decide to I‚Äôll be your first Patreon supporter. Seriously, Thank You. I get starved for this kind of stuff even though I make spirits for a living. You‚Äôre doing the lords work.
Oh geez well thank you very much! And very cool that you're in the industry yourself. 

If you go over to the whiskey network at r/Scotch, r/Bourbon, and r/worldwhisky there's lots of other great reviewers doing some good work, not to mention other good stuff here and r/rum as well."

Bourbon review #191

*****

**New Riff Bourbon single barrel, 55.85%**

**Nose:** Rich delicious toasted oak, graham cracker, vanilla, smooth sweet corn, orange bitters, chocolate, balanced spice. Great nose, rich and balanced and Bourbon-y.

**Taste:** Big sweet Bourbon corn, balanced spice kick, caramel, zingy orange, rich clean toasted wood, vanilla. This is really nice, hits all the classic Bourbon notes. Leans brash and corny but stays very well balanced with great flavor and great toasted oakiness 

**Finish:** Spice, sweet brash corn, metallic caramel, sweet wood. Sweet spicy finish, short but not bad at all

*****

* Easily the best New Riff Bourbon I've had, and the first one in a while that has really impressed me. And as far as I know it's just a random single barrel. It's corny and sweet with nice flavor and it manages to stay very well balanced overall. I really like how New Riff is operating so I'm happy to have finally found a Bourbon from them that agrees with me. For comparison I poured some of my other favorite NR, the r/Bourbon single barrel pick. They are both good but this one wins. The corn and sweetness is more well-rounded, and it has an effortless rich oakiness. More balanced overall. It's the kind of stuff that makes me excited to see what they accomplish in the future with more age. Cheers!

Scotch review #208

*****

**Talisker 15, 2019 Special Release, 57.3%**

**Nose:** Rich and chocolatey, robust malt, salted caramel, clean powerful smoke, tons of briney maritime notes, toffee, rich chocolatey toasted oak, vanilla, smoky menthol char. Quintessential Talisker but on steroids, exceptional nose

**Taste:** Sweet salted caramel and smooth powerful smoke, big sweet vanilla, robust gritty malt, chocolatey toasted oak, tons of sharp brine, toffee and sweet charred barrel notes. Very sweet, big rich flavor, complex and delicious. Like the nose it's quintessential Talisker amped up to cask strength

**Finish:** Big flavorful finish of sweet chocolatey smoke, huge sharp brine, sweet menthol char and vanilla, some friendly peppery spice. Sweet smoke and vanilla linger a long time

*****

* This is a great bottle. Lots of sweet barrel notes, chocolate richness, brine and smoke. Complex and rich and delicious. Everything I loved about the standard 10yr but dialed up to cask strength. It does an excellent job of highlighting Talisker's strengths in Bourbon barrels and setting it apart from Islay peat within it's own delicious category.

That sounds really good. How‚Äôd you get it? Price? How would it be vs the 18?
5 more year must have a real smooth effect on the peat side.
Do you have a post or document with all of your reviews? One where I could see all the 10s, 9s, etc?
Great review.  I found the 2020 Talisker 8 locally and it is good, but I think I would have prefered this. Shame they didn't export any of these to the US last year.
Not the OP, but:

It's fantastic. 

It's easy to find in Europe, so I got my bottle by buying it online and paying international shipping.

As for price, I want to say it was around $120, but this is removing vat, adding shipping (shipping cost spread across several bottles).

The 18 is smoother, more rounded, and what you would think of in an ideal version of a standard bottling. This bottle at cask strength is bolder, more flavorful, and a bit punchier.

Both are great, if you haven't had the 18 I'd buy that, if you've had the 18 and enjoy it I'd go with the 15... I like keeping both on the shelf.
It's not sold in the US, I had to order it from Europe. I used FineDrams.com and I think it was about $130 before shipping

The 18 is fantastic, it's a different kind of Scotch than this. It's more of an old school, average proof well aged Scotch that is very refined and complex. No single note hits too big. This is a cask strength beast. So they're hard to compare, but I scored them both the same fwiw
It's a very clean and smooth smoke, but still very powerful. I find that to be the case with some peated Highland Scotches too. Very well done here
I really wish I did. Sometimes I would like to look back at my own reviews for reference. If I was more computer savvy I might make a document or webpage. There's always the Whisky review archive in the sidebar, I log my stuff there but it's only organized alphabetically and you can't see scores. 

I can tell you that I'm very sparing with my 9's and 10's. 9 is basically my top score, with 10 being something out of this world amazing. Off the top of my head the only 10 I can think of is a Brora 35 year and a rum.
Thanks! I've heard great things about that 8 year. Quite a few people like it more than this 15, so I'm sure they're both winners."

Bourbon review #190

*****

**New Riff ""Maltster"" Malted Wheat Bourbon, bottled in bond 50%**

**Nose:** Toffee, cinnamon, bready toasted malt, creamy caramel, dark charred oak, brash corn, minty undercurrent

**Taste:** Sweet creamy caramel, bready malt, vanilla, hot cherry, dark toasted wood, hot blast of flavor with brash corn, cinnamon and spice

**Finish:** Sweet dessert notes, cherry, caramel toasted wood, blast of hot spice

*****

* Like most New Riff I've had it can't quite overcome it's youthfulness, but there's some really nice flavor in here. I especially like the malty and bready nose. The sweet creamy and bready notes continue in the taste and finish but it's a bit light and masked by the brash heat and spice. For being a special release I don't think it's anything amazing, I would rate it alongside their standard bottled in bond stuff. But it's an interesting experiment and you gotta love their methods and transparency. I think when it settles down with some age this will be some really Great Bourbon, it's tasty stuff

I just cracked mine open today and really enjoy it. I don‚Äôt find it as harsh as others have mentioned here. In fact I find it to be the smoothest New Riff I‚Äôve had between the small batch, single barrel and this. It‚Äôs my favorite of those three and I really enjoy it. Wish I could get my hands on another.
Spot on in my opinion - it was decent and had potential, but felt young and a little rough around the edges, as most young whiskies do to me.
nice review-- i've been trying to find a bottle unsuccessfully. talked to one of my guys and he's been trying to get some cases to no avail.

I find it interesting with these newer distilleries that are putting out interesting products but don't quite have the age yet-- and where they go from here. could be some really fine new labels out there once the barrels age a bit more.
Thanks. Surprised it has so much heat for a wheater.
Thanks! Agreed, it will be interesting to see what they do in the coming years. Good luck finding a bottle, I hear these went very quickly
Young is young, regardless of mashbill. It's all just grain. I recently had a Rebel Yell single barrel that was 4-5 years old, and that stuff was a complete disaster. So things could definitely be worse
First bad report I‚Äôve seen on the Rebel Single Barrel. Sorry you got a dud.
Rebel Yell makes a single barrel that isn't the 10year?  Because the 10 year single barrel is outstanding
It's the only one I've had a chance to try, glad to hear other ones are better. It was a blind mystery sample"
"Review #438: Barrell Rye (MGP) 7 year single barrel 58.04%, Wine & Whiskey Cellars",,https://i.redd.it/qp2fwjevt0761.jpg,"Bourbon Review #189

*****

**Barrell Rye single barrel, 7 year MGP #M771, Wine & Whisky Cellars pick, 58.04%**

**Nose:** Hot minty rye and cinnamon spice, mild dill, caramel, stale toasted wood, brash wood notes, herbal. It's a decent spicy rye nose but kind of uneventful with some funky wood notes

**Taste:** Cinnamon spice, toffee, brash stale toasted wood, hot zingy spice and cherry, caramel. Mint and rye spice builds big and hot, it's hot and brash. Fierce spicy rye flavor which always scores extra points with me but it's a little too hot and unbalanced. 

**Finish:** Big minty and peppery rye spice, hot cinnamon, funky wood. Hot, brash, and spicy Rye finish

*****

It's an enjoyable MGP Rye, but nothing too special. Nice bold Rye flavor and spice but it's too brash and unbalanced and otherwise uneventful. A great example of how important barrel variation can be. 7-9 year MGP Rye single barrels from Willett and SAOS are some of the best Whiskey I've ever had, a far cry from this stuff even though they have similar stats. It's tasty though and it will satisfy the MGP Rye itch on those occasions when I don't need something jaw-dropping. I just want to know where all those honey barrels of yesteryear are going now

Great review my friend. How do you see it compared to the 6y senator rye?
Dang, sounds a little disappointing. Standard rye profile it seems but I was hoping it'd bring something special. 
I got the bottle that K&L picked. Hoping that one is a little better!
>I just want to know where all those honey barrels of yesteryear are going now

I haven't tried any yet, but from what I've read many of them are going to Old Carter. The problem is you have to pay $200+ to get a bottle...
Senator is way better than this. It's one of the better MGP ryes I've had in recent years
Did K&L have a Barrel MGP rye? Must have missed that one
Good to know, these mgp ryes are on the list to be reviewed
I loved my bottle of the senator. Problem for me is finding a cheaper, bright MGP rye for drinking. SAOS rye used to fill that void for me at 30ish a bottle but I feel like there isn't a non barrel proof bright rye anymore. All have been moved into the $70+ range. Any suggestions?
Yep. 7 year as well. It sold in a day or two.
Looking forward to you thoughts on this one
Agreed The Senator is probably the best MGP Rye I've had in recent years. Good age, great flavor profile. Redemption Barrel Proof 10 year is another standout, although it's pretty oaky and not as much of the brighter profile you're talking about. I've had some good Bonesnapper X-Ray Rye single barrel selections, but I haven't seen any of them around for a while. FYI Senator is starting to do single barrel selections, all 6 years old and cask strength. I haven't tried any yet but I have one en route. 

EDIT: Just realized you were looking for cheaper suggestions. I recommend Bulleit 10yr Rye, High West Double Rye, or New Riff Rye BIB. But yeah it's hard finding good cheap Rye these days
Oh nice. How much was it? This one was about $90 or $100, other reason I'm a little sore about it
I thought about bone snapper (looks like they moved on from mgp rye)  and double rye is a shell of its former self. Bulleit 12yr seems to have disappeared in NJ. 
I will pick up another bottle of senator if I ever see it again (they also have an 8 yr rye version.
The same company for the senator makes a $30 bottle of 4 yr 100 proof rye called roulette rye but i haven't seen it. Hoping that fits the bill
$100. Too high. I figured that's about the going rate for mgp SiB cs rye though.
Oh right the bulleit rye is 12 not 10 my bad. Sounds like you're pretty well informed of MGP Rye releases, unfortunately I dont think I know anything you dont know. That's why I was wondering in my review where all the honey barrels are going these days :(
Rye has been disappointing for me over the years. Old highwest was killer but ran out of Barton. Saos had all of the rye honey barrels but that ran out. I cant believe there's not another company doing what Smoke wagon did, i.e. buy new make and age at MGP but in specific locations for a consistent flavor profile.
 I'm guessing proof & wood is doing that with the senator/roulette ryes so it might take a while. Smooth ambler should have done that years ago, shame they sort of abandoned it."

Scotch review #207

*****

**Fettercairn 2006 12, The Ultimate #107682, Bourbon barrel, 54.1%**

**Nose:** Floral and fruity and malty. Light floral perfume, grassy malt, sweet cereal, sweet vanilla and sugary frosting, mild wood funk, vibrant tropical fruit. It's a light grassy malt but lots of vibrant floral and fruity notes, very cohesive and sweet.

**Taste:** Sweet barley, vanilla, rich tropical fruit, big floral notes, ripe sugary pineapple, pear, rich cake. It has a very rich and fruity sweetness to it, it's a lighter flavor profile but densely packed and rich. Fun and fruity and malty. It reminds me of The Laddie a bit, has that same fun fruity malt with just a bit of that lactic note minus the wine funk.

**Finish:** Bright zingy floral notes, smooth tropical fruits and malt, some spice

*****

This is really nice stuff. Flavor is cohesive and well put together. The malt is sweet and floral and light but with a rich fruitiness that gives it some body. A fun and sweet malty Scotch, in a light-duty kind of way

This sounds really good. I‚Äôd buy a bottle of this. I see you got some mild wood funk on the nose, any in the taste or any herbal notes?
Fettercairn gets a lot of shit, but this sounds delicious and right up my alley. The Ultimate bottlings seem to almost always be a really good value too. Nice review.
Initially I got a little of that ""vomity"" funk that turns people off from Laddie a lot, but it faded with some air. But no, not too much off or funky here
If you look through my history I recently reviewed a whole bunch of Ultimate bottlings from FineDrams. They all ranged from good to great, no total duds. But there were a few that even at the great price I wouldn't want to buy
Vomity funk, ah, not good. Glad none of that was present. I've only had a couple of Fettercairns and they've been older ones, so maybe that's the difference. The ones I've had are sweet and rich like you've described then it swerves off to some savory, herbal notes, minerally, then back to sweet again, and that continues, back and forth. I see Dramtime.nl has this one, might have to pick one up.Happy Holidays.
Definitely not always the best quality casks, but usually pretty solid. I just opened a 2007 FF sherry Glenlivet from them the other night after enjoying a similar one from Signatory. I'm hoping it wears off, but it had a massive rubber note that reminded me of Ardbeg a bit but not in a nice way.
Well it's the vomity funk in a good way haha. With Laddie I've heard others describe it as as Lactic or that yogurty acidic flavor. It's what people tend to love or hate about Laddie
This one?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/jy24ad/review_422_glenlivet_12yr_2007_the_ultimate_1st/
I've heard that too, especially with Laddie. I haven't run across that yet but we all have different tasting abilities. One time something will taste one way and another time same thing taste different. I think my taste buds are not as in tuned as others and that could be a good thing.
Close. Mine is 64.4% and cask number 900246. It sounds similar otherwise, besides the rubber in mine."

**New Riff ""Balboa Rye,"" BIB 50%**

**Nose:** Very promising nose. Clean and rich with big Rye character. Toasted wood, big crisp menthol and evergreen, clean sharp rye, green apple, dill, toffee, earthy tobacco, easy peppery spice

**Taste:** Nice thick mouthfeel with big beautiful Rye flavor. A bit hot at first. Thick caramel, toasted wood, syrupy cherry, sharp evergreen and clean rye spice that really jumps out, peppery heat hits big, sweet herbal rye. Sweet and spicy and hot, great Rye experience overall 

**Finish:** Big herbal and minty rye flavor, sharp and clean, spice, sweet toasted wood and hot cherry menthol. Delicious menthol rye flavor lingers for a long time

******

This has all the big bold Rye flavor that the standard BIB Rye was missing(imo). That bottle was a huge disappointment to me. When I initially heard that a new 100% Rye mashbill was coming out I was hoping for something more like this Balboa Rye. It has big vibrant Rye character, very clean and sharp. Maybe a bit young but it performs really well, and if you are a Rye fiend like me it satisfies that Rye itch very nicely.

I bought all three of these releases, looking forward to trying them
I really enjoyed the Balboa. It was not a big hit with my local bourbon club. To each their own I guess.
I tried just tried my first bottle from new riff. Picked up the single barrel.  I am enjoying it very much. I‚Äôll have to keep an eye out for this.
I just picked up a bottle of their ""winter whiskey"" and I'm really enjoying it.  Really tastes like how you'd imagine their bottled in bond was finished in a barrel that aged imperial stout in it.  Very nice milk chocolate notes that blended in with the core profile.  No overt sweetness added.  Very good product.  I'd give it a 6/10.  At $50 certainly worth the buy if for nothing else than uniqueness of it, but it's a very good pour as well.
Great review! Was lucky enough to snag one of these bottles, and your review is spot on!
Great review, grabbed a bottle a few days ago as I like to keep a couple bottles of rye in my collection and took a chance on this even though I'm not a fan of new Riff bourbon and damn this is good stuff.  Super sweet and still spicy at the same time with a really good finish.  Great bottle
Nice, which ones? In addition to this one I also have a sample of the malted wheat one to try
Strong Rye flavor can be polarizing. Some people prefer barely legal mashbills that basically taste like Bourbon, and don't like the strong rye notes of a 100% mashbill. I'm a rye fiend myself and crave stuff like this
Do you know how much it cost?
Damn you I'm jealous! But also, thanks and right on
If you don't mind my asking, how much did it cost you?
I got the balboa, and the two maltsters. One is a wheat, the other is a rye. Gold and red on the label. So I got the other rye in addition to what you got
This is me except I don't think barely legals taste like bourbon (minus like Rare Breed Rye which literally just taste like a more spicy/herbal Rare Breed). Usually BLs just taste so strong on herbal-ness to me and better for cocktails than sipping. 

I love higher Ryes, I'll reach for WFE 4yr over basically any other Rye to sip including Handy.

And found a distillery in FL that does a funky 65/35 Rye/Wheat mash which I don't think anybody does, 6yr single barrel, and I'm really enjoying it. And unlike many craft companies their priced well, that was only $35. If that was X company it'd be like ""that'll be $95 please......""

https://i.imgur.com/gpE6PAQ.jpg
I think I gave 50 bucks a bottle when it was released. I had friend that was fortunately going by the distillery at the right time.

*****

**Domaine de Jouanda 1998 21 year, cask #312, 45%**

**Nose:** Rich elegant wood, dark toasted oak, sticky sweet caramel, prunes, plum, rich grape, chocolate, warm tingly spice. Delicious nose, oaky but stays warm and balanced with the dark fruits

**Taste:** Smooth sweet grape, ripe plum, bright cherry and grape, delicious and beautiful vanilla, sweet caramel, dry oak notes, rich smooth toasted wood, light chocolate. Elegant and velvety smooth mouthfeel. It's a bit dry but the fruits are so rich and complex so it doesn't feel too muted. Beautifully elegant and cohesive

**Finish:** The tart grape builds brighter and sweeter with lots of rich and sweet fruit notes, dark plum, sweet happy cherry, sweet wood notes, vanilla, some pleasant spice

*****

A fantastic Armagnac, very fruity and sweet. Has a really nice rich oakiness that stays incredibly smooth and balanced with all the complex fruit flavors. Very cohesive with a great velvety smooth mouthfeel. Both these Jouandas at K&L are crowd pleasers I think. Both are easy drinking and smooth but with great complexity and mouthfeel.

Brandy review #18

*****

**Domaine du Cardinat 1998 21 year, 49.5%**

**Nose:** Toasted oak, lots of musty wood, bubblegum sweetness, tart grape and berries, smooth dark tannins, coffee and chocolate

**Taste:** Tart syrupy grape, dark cherry, chocolate, tobacco, toasted oak, vanilla, burnt caramel. Dark oak notes that are dry and mellow, fruits are subdued. It's a bit dry and overly smooth in the mouthfeel. Nice mellow toasted woodiness

**Finish:** Sweet dark cherry syrup, vanilla, smooth dark oak, some bitter wood and spice

*****

* It's mostly a nice balanced yak that leans on the oaky and dry side with subdued syrupy fruits. Some tannic wood notes creep in but nothing too crazy. I would not regret buying a bottle of this one bit especially at the price, but having tasted it I will skip it. I liked the 2005 14yr from last year more. This could hit the spot if you want something a little more dry and mellow but still oaky

Brandy review #17

*****

**Domaine de Jouanda 1992 27 year, cask #262, 40%**

**Nose:** Rich caramel and honey, floral notes, graham cracker, orange, bright sugary fruits, smooth warm grape, sweet vanilla, toasted wood. Floral and fruity in an upbeat way, with just enough honey and caramel richness. Complex and pleasant

**Taste:** Surprisingly rich at 40%. Rich caramel, honey, sugary wafer, vanilla icing, floral sweetness, orchard fruits, tart berry, sweet bright grape, clean lightly toasted wood. Pleasant and sweet and upbeat. Lots of sweet delicate fruits and floral notes, with enough caramel toasted oak notes to give it a richer backbone. Oak is clean and unobtrusive though. Very complex and sweet and rich with a velvety mouthfeel.

**Finish** Tart berry and rich sweet caramel, vanilla, lingering grape and sweet barrel notes

*******

I'm gonna be honest, I'm kind of a proof whore and I wasn't expecting much from this at 40%. But I am pleasantly surprised to say I was wrong. Flavorful and pleasant. Great mouthfeel and complexity. It's light, but in a velvety smooth way as opposed to just feeling watered down. But it's still rich enough that drank blind I might have guessed this as 46%. Really interesting style on the other end of the spectrum from oak heavy Bourbon-like yaks

Scotch review #206

*****

**Laphroaig Cairdeas 2020 Port and Wine Casks, 52%**

**Nose:** Big medicinal Laphroaig peat, charred vanilla, milk chocolate, candy-sweet soft red wine notes, strawberry, cherry, menthol spice and sweet barrel char. Delicious nose, it's sweet but not a heavy wine dose at all.

**Taste:** Sweet tart cherry, caramel, big beautiful medicianl Laphroaig peat, creamy milk chocolate, strawberry candy, rich vanilla, menthol, sweet barrel char. Plenty of big medicinal peat & char but it's been softened with a nice chocolatey richness and red wine influence that gives a balanced candy sweetness.

**Finish:** Sweet vanilla, big lingering menthol char, Laphroaig medicinal peat and sweet candy cherry. Long sweet peaty finish

*****

Laphroaig peat with a balanced and friendly sweetness that never feels too wine heavy like sherry often can. The red wine balances nicely with lots of chocolate, signature medicinal peat and sweet charred barrel notes. It's on the softer side for a cask strength Laphroaig but it works well. Laphroaig rarely disappoints and this is another great one, even if it's not one of my favorite Cairdeas releases. Also I should mention that this is not the repeat of the 2013 Portwood Cairdeas that many had hoped for. It's a much different style.

Oh man, this one sounds great. Those are some tasty sounding notes.
I get a lot of cheese on this one, similar fruit notes and some of the classic frog stench, this one was very good, but 2019 is much better, imo.

Nice review!
Because someone always asks, here is a rough estimate of my personal rankings of the Cairdeas releases so far from best to worst:

* 2015 200th anniversary (favorite)

* 2013 Portwood (amazing)

* 2019 TripleWood

* 2020 Port & Wine

* 2018 Fino

* 2014 Amontillado

* 2017 Quarter Cask

* 2016 Madeira (worst by faaar)
I thought for sure you of all people would have this new one!

Yeah it's good, just not really what I look for in a Laphroaig so much. Really enjoying it though
What didn't you like about the Madeira?
Wow...poor Madiera!
Hah, well, I have a bottle but not opened yet. I‚Äôm trying to work thru some of my open bottles. Looking forward to opening it up though, sounds great.
It was way overly sweet to me, had a sickly sweet wine influence that was unbalanced and unpleasant. I struggled with that bottle til the very last drop. Some people loved it though so that's just my personal experience"
"Review #431: Cardinat 1988 31 year, 47%",,https://i.redd.it/tl7k6i364v361.jpg,"Brandy review #16

*****

**Cardinat 1988 31 year, Bas Armagnac, 47%**

**Nose:** Rich fudgy chocolate, dark tannic wood, black cherry, coffee, caramel, thick sludgy fruits, overripe cherry, dark tart fruitiness, vanilla. Dark and tannic with thick sludgy fruits

**Taste:** Sweet mellow fruits, big dry tannic wood, very dark/woody but drinkable at the abv, black cherry, mellow tart grape, chocolatey wood, leather, smooth tannic wood, menthol, sweet vanilla. It's very approachable at the abv despite all the heavy wood and dark notes, maybe even a bit too light but still delicious

**Finish:** A big finish, pleasantly sweet. Dark deeply toasted wood, dry and sweet, caramel, lightly building spice, sweeter fruits of dark syrupy cherry, chocolate, sweet vanilla

*****

This is a very solid package from start to finish, although it definitely feels a bit light mouthfeel. It hits tannic and dark at first but with some air more chocolatey richness and dark sweet fruits emerge. It's actually kind of fun being able to explore such dark and tannic notes at the approachable abv, keeps it from feeling like too much of an oak bomb I think. The more I drink it the more I enjoy it.

nice review. the 34 year old 1981 cardinat is one of the best armagnacs i‚Äôve ever had. it was a fruity, sweet, and wood bomb. they later released it again from the same vintage a few years later. i bought a few them. i hoped it was the same but that time around it was several years older. i hated it - it was so over oaked, tannic, and bitter. it tasted like walnut shells. this sounds a lot more like the first iteration of that vintage.
Thanks for your nice thorough review! I have a bottle waiting at K&L and it sounds pretty in line with what I was expecting (after reading their reviews). I know you covered their Lous Pibous #146. Would you say this, in a way, is a lighter version of that one?
Did you also get the 1984 Cardinat that K&L had recently?
It definitely is a wood bomb and a bit tannic, but yeah not overly so imo. I'd be interested to see where this one falls on your scale compared to those 2 different bottlings
Thanks for reading, glad you found it informative!

>Would you say this, in a way, is a lighter version of that one?

No, they aren't very similar. The Encantada Pibous is much more dynamic and spicy overall, almost Bourbon like. This Cardinat tastes way older, darker and more tannic. It's chocolatey rich and tannic. Very different beasts
I have a bottle and a sample of that one but I haven't tried them yet
i‚Äôd be willing to give cardinat another go. did you get this at k&l?
""...chocolatey rich and tannic""! I need this bottle NOW! haha, I see, thanks.
Yep, $80 over there. They have a 1998 21yr at 49% as well
that‚Äôs a pretty amazing price for a 31 years old spirit! too bad k&l no longer ships out of cali though."

**Ballechin 11 2005, ""The Ultiamte"" cask #177, Bourbon barrel, 56.2%**

**Nose:** Huge clean Islay-style peat, rich sweet caramel, lemon, sugar pastry, thick vanilla, sweet barrel char. The peat is huge on this but it's so clean and sweet and bright. Very ""happy"" nose for such a peat monster

**Taste:** Intense peat but with very crisp and clean sweet mouthfeel. Huge clean medicinal peat, excellent gritty vanilla char, caramel, sweet vanilla and pastry, pop of lemon, barrel char. Thick and creamy pastry sweetness with huge clean peat 

**Finish:** Vanilla icing and pastry, clean peat and vanilla builds huge. Lingers pastry-sweet and peaty

My first proper Ballechin, this stuff is killer. Huge Islay levels of peat but it's super clean and sweet. Lots of creamy pastry and sweet barrel notes, a bright and happy peat monster. Almost like a highland style smoky malt but with Islay levels of peat. A comparison that kept coming to mind is Laphroaig Cairdeas 2015, which was 100% Bourbon barrel and  also amazingly ""clean"" for how peaty it was

Sounds like a family resemblance with another Ballechin I tried recently. That had this super distinct condensed milk and caramelised biscuit (Lotus Biscoff) thing going for it, with the heavy clean peat you describe. Super sweet and rich. It's almost like a less dirty Longrow for me.
Thanks for the review! Its amazing how close they get to Laphroaig sometimes. I've never had an ex-bourbon Ballechin, but this sounds fantastic.
It reminded me of a bourbon barrel laphroaig, until I poured some to drink with it haha. Laphroaig peat isnt necessarily bigger, but its meaner and more boggy and gnarly. This ballechin was actually peatier than the CS laphroaig I poured though
>its meaner and more boggy and gnarly

Hah, it grabs you by the throat!
Tasted any Fettercairn lately?
No I still have the Fettercairn sample to get to. With this batch of The Ultimate IB samples I got I wanted to blow through all the ones still available just in case I loved something. And last night I was in the mood for peat so I had this. All I have left now is the Fettercairn and a Staoisha"

**Craigellachie 18 1994 Cadenhead, Bourbon and sherry hogsheads, 54.4%**

**Nose:** Caramel, tannic wood, thick gritty malt, smooth fruitiness that is dry and earthy-sweet, dry sulphury wine . Really nice but kind of closed. 

**Taste:** Tannic wood, sulphury dry fruits, dark caramel, earthy sweetness, thick malt, clove. Mild and dry fruitiness of dark strawberry and raisins. Lots of nice dark and tannic earthy flavor, but it feels a little too dry and closed like it's missing something.

**Finish:** Sweeter on the finish with dark strawberry, tannic wood, spice, caramel

*******
Dark and earthy sweetness but the flavor never gets big enough to reach it's full potential. Ends up feeling too cohesive and closed, and a little boring. And it's super dry too. But it's all good flavor, nothing off or unpleasant. It feels like when you almost sneeze: everything is in place for an epic Scotch and then it just falls short. It's much better if you approach it as a delicate Scotch, and water helps this a lot by lightening the flavor and bringing out the sweeter notes. A much better Scotch overall with water added, which is rare I find

Bye bye, Small Batch.....forever :(
So I‚Äôm reading your very fine review and I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äú add some water‚Äù then I see you did. The result, it turned what was a very good Craigellachie into a good but delicate Scotch. I‚Äôve never thought of Craigellachie as a delicate malt, so, the water wasn‚Äôt the answer. Sounds like a really good at CS. 
The small batch series will be missed.
Been fortunate to attend a private tasting in the barrel room with the sales manager Mark. Cracking banter and everything we drank was 18 years or older. Springbank tour was also one of the best we‚Äôve done
What small batch are you talking about?
It's just kind of a weird one. It didnt have delicate flavors, felt like there should be more to it. Adding the water helped salvage it really felt like it was missing something.
Very cool! I generally love Craigellachie even if this particular one wasn't a zinger. Springbank is always nice too, I've heard their tour is good
Cadenhead's Small Batch, they're discontinuing it for a line of stuff served at 46% üëé
That's the downside to single casks and small batches.  Sometimes there is just something missing that the blender would work in with other casks.  That's a bummer because on paper this sounds incredible.  What I don't see that I would expect on Craigellachie at this age is some herbs and minerals and that would definitely leave a hole in the profile.
Does sound a bit weird. Kind of like the cask just isn‚Äôt contributing much or quit about half way thru. Ah well, good review.
Oh I didnt even realize that's what this is, oops
Savour them while they last! I plan on scooping ng up quite a few while I can ;)"

**Nose:** Creamy caramel and orange, sweet candy fruits, milk chocolate, big sweet and balanced toasted wood, vanilla, sweet mildly tart grape and cherry, mellow menthol spice. So blissfully pleasant and creamy sweet

**Taste:** Sweet creamy caramel, toasted wood, builds with big bold spice and hot zingy cherry, orange cream, sweet candy fruits, charred vanilla and delicious sweet wood notes. Like the nose it's pleasant and creamy sweet, but with a bigger dose of bold Bourbon-like spice

**Finish:** Brash spice and charred wood, sweet fruits and bitter orange. Leaves with a lingering spice tingle

*****

One of my first Armagnac bottles and it's the kind of stuff that made me fall in love with the style. So delicious and complex and amazing all around. It's hard to just mindlessly sip on an Armagnac like this, every sip ends up being an event like it's the very first time. It's a spicy one, but it's a delicious and well executed spice to me. Creamy and sweet and spicy, everything is on point. Great stuff

Bourbon review #187

**EDIT:** I may have been mistaken about this being a barrel selection. It may just be a distillery release sold at K&L


*****

**New Riff Rye, single barrel #15-6609, 55.35%**

**Nose:** Nose is promising. Nice thick Rye spice, cinnamon, hot menthol, burnt caramel, cacoa, clean toasted wood, hot cherry. Lacking complexity but it's a nice strong Rye nose

**Taste:** Tannic oak, cacao, woody caramel, big hot spice blast, brash Rye spice. Hot and brash, and kind of closed. Unfortunate after the nice nose. A drop of water calms it down, but makes it a little boring. It holds onto that nice pervasive Rye spice with vague wood and caramel notes, some creamy woody sweetness. Kinda nice with water

**Finish:** Tons of spice, hot menthol, brash wood. Finish is nicer after adding some water. Sweet woody caramel, clean thick Rye spice

***********

It's never a good sign when I'm adding water to Whiskey. I usually only do it when I'm not enjoying something in an attempt to salvage it, and it rarely works that well. This one was just too hot and closed, water calmed it down and brought out some nicer notes but dulled down the BP experience. I think I still prefer it with water, it helped enough to raise the score a point. I really want to enjoy New Riff Rye, but so far I'm not a fan. I remember liking Willett a lot more than this at 4 years old. Maybe the hot and spicy style will pay off better with more age on it, here's hoping

The Willett 4 year rye I had was waaaay better than this one. This one is just hot and brash. It brings the rye notes for sure but it's all over the place and unbalanced.
New Riff doesn‚Äôt do private selections of their Rye yet. This was probably just the barrel that was sent to the store. Surprised to see it only rated a 6, I think most of these are 7-8, very good barrels!
Felt the same way, but after a few pours, the bottle has rounded out nicely and feels much more put-together.

Edit: I‚Äôve only had the generic barrel proof SiB rye, not a pick.
Agreed. ~~I just don't know what K&L is thinking with their picks sometimes.~~ I can't see something like this being a preference thing that others might enjoy more, it's just kind of a mess. I was probably a little generous with my scoring but water did help more than I thought it would

EDIT: might not actually be a store pick
Thanks for the info. I was confused and thought this was a store select. And if anything a 6 was generous, this bottle wasn't very good.
I'm not sure that K&L actually picks their New Riffs. Last time I was their they told me those are just sent to them, they don't actually select them.
Bummer. Guess they can‚Äôt all be winners!
Sounds like it may not be an actual store pick, but just a single barrel release from New Riff? I did find a single barrel Rye being sold in Europe at the exact same abv of 55.35%, I thought that was odd."

**Smoke Wagon Bourbon(MGP) Single Barrel K&L pick #320, 8 year, 62.2%**

**Taste:** Big hot blast of spice, cinnamon, hot cherry, big clean toasted oak, burnt caramel and brown sugar, tobacco, fun zingy Bourbon and spice. Hot and lively and sweet. Big flavor and lots of fun

**Nose:** Chocolatey toasted wood, tannic oakiness, sweet brash corn and brown sugar, smooth minty spice, thick caramel, cherry, sweet vanilla. Tame after the 8yr but it's rich and sweet

**Taste:** Huge rich oaky flavor that builds. Black cherry, rich chocolatey toasted wood, dry tannic oakiness, mellow spice, sweet brash corn, brown sugar, burnt caramel, sweet vanilla. Has a beautiful rich oaky mouthfeel with tart cherry sweetness, sweet wood notes, smooth dark oak, some corn and spice. Maybe a bit dry and tannic but not too much. Even-keeled and balanced with just enough kick

**Finish:** Sweet oaky brown sugar finish with cherry, vanilla, gentle mint, milk chocolate. Leaves sweet and pleasant and oaky

*****************************

Two different beasts, both are delicious and fun. 8yr is a big brash Bourbon kick, lively and sweet. But it stays balanced and sweet in its brashness, never feels like too much of an assault on the palate. Gives you all the fun of a hot wild Bourbon but with plenty of flavor. 12yr is oaky and chocolatey with lots of interesting sweet and tannic barrel notes, but still holds onto some corn and spice brashness. Very sweet and oaky. A complex and delicious Bourbon. The 12yr wins out as the better of the 2 for me, but I still really love the hot and lively style of the 8yr

I gotta dive into that 12 year. It sounds more up my alley.
Nice review. I've only had the UC/UF, but I really enjoy it. I'd love to get my hands on one of these one day soon. I'll have to keep my eyes on K&L moving forward from here on out.
There he is! He‚Äôs glorious.
No problem, the monkey gets a lot of love haha. I've had it forever, but you I think you can find it if you just google monkey drinking poster
Looking forward to your thoughts whenever you do
I'm sure you would enjoy these then, they are definitely a step up from the uncut. I don't know how much MGP stock they have or how much more of these will be released, but worth keeping an eye out
I assume you mean the monkey poster? Ha I'm always glad when people enjoy it!
Yeah, it seems I found out about SW just a bit too late. I think the demand has been pretty intense.
I follow their Instagram, its technically MGP but they buy it as new make then store it at specific locations at MGP. It seems a bit different then others buying MGP in bulk but interestingly enough they just bought a bunch of bulk MGP. Wonder if they'll do another label or something.
You know it! It‚Äôs not a buckydean review without it IMO

Niiiiiiiice!  Now if only I could get more yak at 47.2%+.....
Interestingly enough, I think Chateau du Tariquet is near the village of Courrensan which is also near the domaine where the Aficionados x Fine Drams Grosperrin 1996 Bas-Armagnac distillate originated.

"Review #423: Hazelburn 14yr 2005 rum barrel, 52.6%",,https://i.redd.it/hct4ju1i4w061.jpg,"Wonderful review. I have the 10 year old and love it. And, what is particularly great about your review for me is your use of the word ‚ÄúScotchy‚Äù, which is exactly how my wife described the 10 year old when she had her first sip - makes me think that the base spirit just has that as part of its overall profile.
I would be pretty tempted by all hazelburns that are not wine or fortified wine, a rum cask hazelburn seems like the rarest of the rare

*****

**Hazelburn 14yr 2005, fresh rum barrel, 52.6%**

**Nose:** Caramel, crisp and clean and sweet, briny, earthy barley, green apple, thick bready malt, creamy sweetness. Super thick and malty, Scotchy

**Taste:** Big sweet barley, thick malty body, salted caramel, huge creamy sweetness, vanilla pastry. Thick and malty with a nice briny funk and balanced creamy sweetness. Great viscous mouthfeel

**Finish:** Big sugary blast, sweet barley, clean vanilla char, light spice. Rides out sweet and malty and lightly charred

*****

A thick malty dessert Scotch. Creamy sweetness and barley with a thick malty character, all comes together beautifully. Rum barrels are never obvious to me in Scotch. They tend to give a thick creamy sweetness like here, but I don't think it's something I could pick out blind. This is still one of the sweeter Rum barrel Scotches I've had though and it's all balanced really well

It's nice to see a review of this, I haven't opened my bottle yet but was curious how the rum barrel would affect the Hazelburn spirit in contrast the Springbank 15 rum which I found was very soft.
Thanks for reading! Glad you liked my use of the word ""Scotchy"" haha. I use it in my reviews from time to time, it's difficult to describe. But I think it's about that base spirit like you said, when it has that robust malty base and rich mouthfeel. You know it when you see it
Nice review! Have you had a chance to try the SB Rum Cask?
No I haven't tried that one. I have had a Springbank single rum cask before that was great though"

**Glenlivet 12yr 2007, The Ultimate #900262, 1st fill sherry butt, 64.8%**

**Nose:** Burnt woody toffee, big darkly toasted oak, smoky char, tobacco, mellow wood spice, mint, subtle dark fruit undercurrent. Wait, is this a Bourbon or a sherried Scotch?

**Taste:** It's hot! Mellow dark fruits, big spice blast, chocolate, rich toasted wood, dark burnt caramel, burnt woody sweetness. Comes at you in a big hot zing, fun but the flavor is lacking a bit.

**Finish:** Spice builds huge with mellow fruits, sweet caramel, mint. Nice long finish, brash sweet & spicy wood finish with some understated fruit sweetness

*****

It's big and dramatic and hot but doesn't offer enough flavor for the experience. The spice blast and wood notes and heat are delicious, but any kind of sherry fruit or malt backbone that would give it more body are too mild. Makes for a big dazzling flash of flavor without much substance. Not awful, it's still a lot of fun. The Bourbony nose is really interesting too. Actually the whole experience is kind of Bourbony. I would pry score it higher as a chocolatey and spicy Bourbon than a sherried Scotch. You may enjoy it a lot if that experience sounds interesting to you

**Benrinnes 14yr 2004, The Ultimate #58, Bourbon hogshead, 57.8%**

**Nose:** buttery malt, big bright floral notes, spirity funk, green apple, light sweet pastry & gentle vanilla. Sharp and floral and spirity, with nice malty sweetness

**Taste:** Sweet buttery malt, barley sugar, lots of spirity new make funk, bright and floral, fruity apple, bright sweet malt, rich pastry

**Finish:** Gets a tad richer on the finish which is nice, light caramel, thick rich malt, sweet pastry and spice

*****

A bright and floral Scotch with big sweet malt. Feels like a mega refill barrel that at least has some decent age on it. It's lively and fun, but it's a little too heavy on the spirity new make funk and big floral notes for me. There's enough richer pastry and malt here to keep it enjoyable though

Sounds like it has tons of potential but lacking in depth, maybe worn out cask?
Even after 14 years it just has too much funky new make flavor. But yeah there's lots of great flavor and potential I think. Maybe it would have done well with a lot more time in the barrel
Look at that colour. That cask must have been a 4th refill or something.
Seems to come back to, every good whisky starts with a good cask. Though, this sounds pretty good to give it a go."

Bourbon review #184

*****

**Larceny Barrel Proof batch A120, 61.6%**

**Nose:** Caramel, cinnamon spice, sweet cherry and hot spice, brash wood, darkly toasted, chocolate. Brash, very straight-forward and hot and Bourbony

**Taste:** Big sweet cherry and hot spice, thick caramel, bold cinnamon, dark toasted wood, chocolate. Interesting play between the sweet fruitiness and dark toasted notes, but it's so hot and brash. Water dulls it all down a bit and more sweet cherry fruits come through, makes it too boring though

**Finish:** Big brash spice, creamy caramel, sweet candy cherry. Simple but tasty finish

*****

Good stuff, it's pretty hot and brash though. Some sweet fruitiness and creamy toasted notes behind the wall of heat. A little water didn't help it much, brought out the sweetness but dulled it down. It's a fine hot and spicy Bourbon, but being a rare full proof Wheater I was hoping for more of a Wheater experience. Straightforward and brash. Solid stuff but doesn't add much to the Bourbon market imo.

Yea this stuff is definitely not in the same class as ECBP. They gotta go older with their larceny stocks I think.
I agree with this review. It‚Äôs not bad but nothing crazy. A120 was very hot and not super interesting but has some nice basic flavors Going on
Sipping on this tonight en route to a bottle kill. Brash is a good word. The sweet, spicy cornbread only peeks out, whereas the B and C batches this year were far more flavorful, and less spicy/hot. Edit: the B is plenty spicy but not overly hot. 

Since you appear to dig the profile at some level, definitely try to get your hands on the B or C. 

PS: where is the anisette monkey? :P
I was super disappointed in A120.  I had high hopes.  Larceny-standard is a great bang for the buck bourbon (for my palate) even though it lacks complexity.  A120 to me was just a hot mess with nothing decent or unique about it.  I kept drinking the entire bottle (over about 2 months) wanting to find something I liked about it, but always coming back to the feeling that Larceny did a kind of poopy job with A120.  The second edition for the year was better, but still not what I was hoping for.......maybe they can get it sorted out with a little time like Stagg Jr managed to do.  Thanks for the review!
Yeah, think you're right. Glad I waited to try it before buying a bottle
Yeah, I would definitely be interested in trying other releases if they're better than this one. Thanks for the advice. 

I love the monkey poster, funny you would inquire about it haha. I drank this from a 2oz sample, so I've just been using stock photos of the bottle when I review a sample. Figure it's more helpful to see the bottle it's from.
I did a review on all 3 batches side-by-side a few weeks ago; there was a clear difference between A vs B and C (FWIW)
C920 is fantastic!"
Review #419: Old Forester 1910,,https://i.redd.it/7d91cjn9ccz51.png,"The story goes that in 1910 the bottling line at Old Forester was damaged in a fire, so mature aged Bourbon that was proofed down and sitting in a vat ready to be bottled was instead thrown back into barrels. It was so good, that they decided to recreate it...over 100 years later. To make this, mature Bourbon was proofed down to 50% before being aged again in new barrels. Courtesy of u/whiskeyncigars

**Old Forester 1910, 46.5%**

**Nose:** Brown sugar, chocolatey toasted wood, vanilla, mocha, tart berry, sweet char. It's mellow and smooth with lots of dark sweet barrel notes, yummy

**Taste:** Sweet, dark, and smooth. Dark caramel toasted wood, chocolate, tart burnt grape, leather, sweet vanilla

**Finish:** Smooth darkly toasted wood, caramel and sweet vanilla char

*****

It's a simple and toned down Bourbon, but it definitely has character like it knows exactly what kind of profile it wants to be and then hits the mark. Dark and sweet and toasted but still super smooth and drinkable. Never feels outright woody or tannic. A serious lack of spice or heat makes this super drinkable too. A fun sipper with a nice mouthfeel

I'm new to bourbon but have already settled on 1910 as my fav. I get marshmallow on the finish which I absolutely love. I admit I'm a sweetness nut - Angels Envy is my 2nd fav - but it's what I like. Nice review.
Thank you. I will.
I have heard polarizing feedback on 1910. I find your review to be most accurate and where I'd rate it at. Very good stuff.
I love vanilla. I think you're right. Have you tried OF1920? I have not. Reviews of 1910 and 1920 are all over the place. For every marshmallow/vanilla review I see, there is someone writing that they taste like cherry cough syrup. Hard to know what to think.  I'm glad I took a chance with 1910.
Is that the story to this? They said there was a fire and had to rebarrel? But what about the secondary is different in the story? It would‚Äôve been put into a holding tank. This makes me hate brown Forman even more than I already do.
Want to try this so much but it‚Äôs non-existent in NC.
I like how you described it, a fun sipper. This is how I feel about woodford double oak too. Nothing too exciting, but a fun easy drink.
Definitely give Woodford Reserve Double Oaked, and Elijah Craig Toasted Barrel a try. They‚Äôre both similar to 1910. Cheers!
I can totally see marshmallow in there, I get that note a lot on darkly toasted sweet whiskies like this. I put sweet vanilla in my notes and I think it's a similar vein
I did not care for 1920. Even as someone who usually prefers barrel proof, I liked 1910 a lot more. I remember 1920 being too herbal or something, it's been a while. But it's a totally different profile from 1910. I really tried to give it a chance but ended up giving the bottle away
The fire was in 1910, and the story goes that it was already in a holding tank waiting to get bottled. They didnt have anywhere else to put it while the bottling equipment was being repaired so they rebarreled it. The rebarreling this time was just for the fun of it, to make this bottle and recreate the happy accident of 1910. That's their story anyway
One of my favorites but sells out quickly. I see bottles maybe once a month. Where in NC?
Yes exactly. They don't all need to be barrel proof bruisers. Sometimes a nice sipper hits the spot and this one does it well
Oof, not good for your accuracy on this review I reckon

*****

**Hochstadter's Rye 16yr, 61.9%**

**Nose:** Gorgeous. Butterscotch, huge cool mint, deep mellow Rye spice, toffee, bitter orange, big warm deeply toasted oak, sweet char, herbal. Incredibly big and thick but elegant, the notes are deep and meld together beautifully

**Taste:** Hot cherry spice, cinnamon, sweet sticky toffee, big bold Rye spice, fruity, brash toasted wood. It's hot and fiery, not super oaky at all which is a surprise. A little water mellows it a bit, brings out more fruitiness, orange, big warm spice, sticky sweet butterscotch flavors. Fun and complex

**Finish:** big bold Rye spice, hot cherry, orange and herbal spice, sweet caramel. The hot fiery Rye simmers and burns a long time, even after adding some water

*****

An excellent Rye. For the age it's still very spicy and lively, which I always love in a Rye. And not super oaky. There's more sweet wood notes of butterscotch and toffee than anything heavy or tannic. Very complex and spicy and fun, not the rich oak bomb I was expecting at all. Didn't quite blow me away for the price and age though, as good as it is. That's just nitpicking a bit though

**Glen Spey 9yr 2010, The Ultimate #804797, 1st fill hogshead, 60.9%**

**Nose:** Butterscotch, toffee toasted wood, nuttiness, thick malt, caramelized sugar, vanilla icing, apple, menthol spice. Smooth rich wood and thick malt. A little water solidifies it all into a creamy, woody, caramel malt

**Taste:** Huge flavor, pretty hot which isn't a surprise given the abv. Hot cherry, butterscotch, caramel and rich toasted wood, clean thick malt, hot spice, darker tannic toffee and char. Water doesn't change it too much, but melds all the flavor together really nicely. Has a thick creamy feel which is neat with all the dark caramel woodiness, but still hangs on to that spice heat

**Finish:** Big finish. Big spice, menthol, hot cherry, tannic wood notes, fruity apple, rich toffee and sweet char. Lively and hot but it's interesting with some delicious flavor beyond the heat

*****

Similar to the 8yr 1st fill hogshead I reviewed earlier today. Heavy wood that balances really well with the delicious malt. This one is hotter and less dry, not surprising with the abv. These are also my very first Glen Speys I think. I'm really impressed with them. I might give the 8yr the slight edge over this one, but it's close and I might even choose differently side by side. Both are good if you want some wood with your malt and both are an excellent value

**Taste:** Dry woodiness, big sweet malt, caramel, smooth chocolate, vanilla, sweet barley sugar. Rich and woody and creamy with big sweet malt notes. A bit too dry maybe, and there's some tannic notes and tobacco but they stay mild

**Finish:** Big spice blast with caramel, creamy vanilla and sweet malt, fruits. The spice and sweet wood/malt makes for a dramatic and lively finish

*****

A good balance of malt and rich wood notes, but it's about as woody as I ever want a malt to get. Kind of walks the line but the wood never intrudes too much. Still plenty of big sweet maltiness. Strikes an interesting and delicious balance, it's a really nice Scotch even if it's just a tad too dry for me personally. Another great value from ""The Ultimate"" bottler

Van Wees, cant go wrong. Thanks for the review.
Always wondered if there was a turf war between them and Ardbeg. ‚ÄúThe Ultimate‚Äù is such a vague phrase I wonder who had it first.
Sounds great. I‚Äôd drink this one.
Just wanna say it's first use not first fill. It's virgin oak.
Sure thing, I've been enjoying trying out these bottlings. And so far I agree they are some really good stuff. Thanks for reading
Are you sure? I thought ""first use"" sounded like an odd way to put it but didn't see anything that would indicate virgin oak. They call it ""first fill"" on the FineDrams writeup too
Hmm weirdly enough even Whiskybase just denotes hogshead. https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/132712/glen-spey-2010-vw

But first use is a pretty strange term to say the cask is a first fill cask too."

My first Mannochmore! Drinks like any number of 10-ish year refill Speyside IB's but I don't mean that as an insult. No name Speyside IB's tend to all have a ""sameness"" to them that can be boring, this falls in that category but is on the higher end of that spectrum. Light, sweet, malty, very balanced, a thoroughly pleasant Scotch. Really shines on the finish too which is nice.

This is always the battle isn't it? Whether it's restaurants, beer, or Whisky we're always looking for stuff that stands out from the crowd. It can be difficult and highly subjective.

**Nose:** Toffee, big warm enveloping peat smoke, earthy funk, sweet chocolatey toasted wood and caramel, light apple fruits, robust malt, vanilla menthol char, brine. Almost Islay levels of smoke but a rich, mellow caramel feel and just amazingly complex. Wow

**Taste:** Pop of rich rich caramel, sweet spice and tart fruits. Then it settles down and the rich complex flavors set in: Sweet toasted wood, chocolate, vanilla char, balanced earthy funk, clean smoke, toasted marshmallow, smooth green apple, sweet barley sugar. Not as smoky as the nose, it all come together balances beautifully with tons of sweet barrel and malt notes. Huge rich flavor but still manages to stay nimble and complex on the palate. Again, just wow

**Finish:** Barley sugar malt and pastry, sweet wood notes, vanilla char, big blast of delicious sweet wood spice. Long, rich, and super sweet finish. Lingering sweet char and smoke 

******

An amazing Scotch. Glen Scotia can be some weird funky stuff, but when it come together it can be amazing like this one. Complex and balanced with a wide range of delicious notes. For a refill barrel it's rich and chocolatey, but there's also plenty of fruits, barley, sweet vanilla char, and that delicious smoke. Nothing takes over too much, it all works together perfectly. Overall it leans on the darkly rich side but it stays complex and nimble on the palate, just delicious. Also I like how you get to enjoy the heavy Islay-style smoke on the nose, but then it calms down on the palate and so much more flavor opens up.

Classic FRPS flavor. Complex, lively and brash in the best way. Big hot clean spice with some syrupy sweetness behind it and signature floral notes. Unfortunately it's just lacking a bit, missing that extra oomph. It's below average for one of these, not top notch, but these bottle's average tends to still be pretty high.

Got mine a couple years ago and I take it out for an occasional pour. I enjoy how this changes flavors at least 2-3x over a few seconds on each sip.
Nice! I always wanted to try some Little Book, glad you enjoyed it!
I was not impressed with it the first go around, 6 mos in I was still meh, need to give it another shot.  Little Book Ch 3.... now that‚Äôs a treasure
I was gifted a bottle of this edition when my toddler was born.  It was quite enjoyable.
Nice review! I will probably pick up a bottle if I can find one. I‚Äôm assuming with the ages of the hooch in the bottle, this is gonna sell for more than the last round of Little Book. How much was the bottle?
How does whiskey develop over time? Didn‚Äôt know that was a thing.
Great review! For those who haven't tried any, the important thing to remember with all of the Little Book releases is that they are experimental. Do not expect it to be like Booker's. Throw out your preconceptions when you try them. 

I really enjoy Chapter 2 for what it is, a really interesting rye forward blend. 

Chapter 3 is everything that's good about Beam. Knob Creek, Baker's, Booker's, and even Basil Hayden's is all in there. It's amazing.

Chapter 4 is fantastic too. It's very much Beam, but earthier. Kinda hard to describe.

Can't wait to see what Chapter 5 brings!
Are these special edition Bookers? Or something different? Apologize for my naivety.
I've been beating this dead horse for a month now but if you can, get Ch. 04! It's this year's release so you may find it at MSRP and, as of Nov., it's my favorite whiskey purchase of 2020. Absolutely amazing bottle.
Wait til the movie version comes out.
This is chapter 2 from 2018, I believe they are on 4 now. As far as I know they retail for around $80-$100
The same way Whiskey can open up in the glass after you pour it, Whiskey can oxidize and change in the bottle over time as the level drops over weeks and months. Sometimes it improves, sometimes you may not like the last 1/4 of a bottle as much, sometimes it's just different or subtle and an interesting change. It's all personal preference
Thanks, and thanks for the info
No problem! No it's not a Bookers release. It's an annual release from Jim Beam, and the idea is that they throw together unusual stuff from their warehouse that is good but doesn't have a place in their normal bottlings. Hence the crazy mixture here of Rye and super old Corn Whiskey. Every year is totally different
You‚Äôre right 4 is the latest release. Msrp was about 120,130 $
Thanks for the info! Just had regular Bookers for the first time this weekend. Pretty good stuff.
Found a bottle here in NC (It's a miracle!). Paid $120. Haven't opened it yet."

**Glengoyne Cask Strength batch 009, 58.8%**

**Nose:** Meaty malt, sweet winey fruits, toffee, vanilla cream, cherry wine. Straightforward pleasant sherry with prominent and meaty maltiness

**Taste:** Toffee, toasted wood, fruity sherry sweetness and spice, robust malt, cherry syrup. It's not a dark and heavy sherry bomb, very even-keeled and balanced. Textbook winey sherry flavor with a nice malty and woody backbone that gives it some meat. Not super sweet. Very pleasant and Scotchy

**Finish:**syrupy cherry and spice, prune, sweet wine sulfur, malt, smooth flavorful sherry

*****

It feels Scotchy and balanced. Nice fruity and winey sherry influence but it's not the main attraction and not overly sweet, has a meaty malt backbone to it. The malt and wood gives it some good richness. Nothing mindblowing but pleasant and tasty for sure.

**Glenlivet 15yr 1995 Signatory Un-Chillfiltered, 1st fill Sherry Butt #144361, 46%**

**Nose:** Toffee, dark chocolate, toasted wood, vanilla, rich dark grape, dry prune, char, wood spice. Dark rich nose, dark mellow fruits and woody

**Taste:** Smooth fruity toffee, watered down and chocolatey, easy woodiness, dark closed grape. There's some tannic wood notes that start to take over and dry it out too much, doesn't work well with the overall watered down flavor.

**Finish:** smooth tannic oak and wood spice, dry oak and light fruits. Dry and oaky and light

*****

Decent enough. Unfortunately it's one of those Scotches where the nose is the best part of the whole experience. Dark rich woody profile with very mellow and subtle dark fruits, but at 46% it just feels oaky-dry and watered down . Might have done better at a bolder cask strength or if it was a bit sweeter

What is that sign in the background? Looks super cool.
Those signatory bottlings are always super sexy...
I've got a 1995 at 18 years.  I've typed up the notes, have the photo, but have been very busy and haven't posted yet.  I have to agree with your summary, but honestly I don't think I'd like it at higher proof any better.  I don't know if it was just poor sherry cask selection or Glenlivet and sherry don't play nice together.  I bought it for a tasting I had planned with friends in April which never happened.  None of them are serious scotch drinkers.  One of my friends only drinks Glenlivet 12 (by the handle) and I thought it would be interesting for him to try.
Thanks, that's just my drinking monkey poster! Its an angle I like to take bottle pics with and it seems to get a lot of love here

*****

**Ballechin 10yr 2007, Signatory Binny's pick, Madeira Hogshead, 59.3%**

**Nose:** Smoke, toffee, creamy vanilla, bitter fruits, dark burnt prune, chocolate toasted wood, spice tingle, sweet menthol char. Very rich and smooth and balanced. Smoky and chocolatey but not an assault

**Taste:** Oh boy it's hot. Hot spice and cherry syrup, toffee, rich smooth smoke, tannic oak, dark bitter and tannic fruits. Some water smooths out the bitterness and spice heat a bit, they're still there but a little better integrated. Chocolate, toasted wood, smooth smoke and mellow spice

**Finish:** Sweet dark fruits, burnt prune, tannic oak, dark rich smoke, big building spice and burnt charred menthol

*****

This one definitely needed some water. There were some harsh bitter and tannic notes that were rather unpleasant. They don't disappear with water but they become a little more integrated and interesting. The smoke is smooth and rich similar to Talisker, not an Islay style assault. Wine fruits are dark and bitter and burnt, not a decadent sweet smoky romp at all. A bit challenging but good, not something I would want to buy

Yeah, had some weird harshness to it
The only other Madeira I can think of is the 2016 Cairdeas, which is the only Cairdeas I actually disliked. So Madeira doesn't have a good track record
>So Madeira doesn't have a good track record

Cosigned. 

I've had an ex-madeira cask malt from each of Balvenie, Benriach, and Glenmorangie and also 2 Irish whiskies (Tyrconnell & Bushmills) and none of them impressed, except maybe the Glenmorangie Bacalta which is pretty decent, but not a great deal more than that IMHO. At this point it isn't a cask type that I'm looking for.
Is there a consistent quality across all those bottles that you disliked and blame on the Madeira?
Good question. 

I'd say that comparing the ex-madeira bottlings with other malts from the same distilleries, it seemed to me that the cask was adding some rather cloying burnt sugary sweetness which just was a poor match for the whisky, it didn't enhance the native sweetness of the malt in a pleasant way nor did it add a counterbalancing set of flavors to create contrast & complexity. It was more like putting sugar on top of an already sweet cereal:

https://www.reddit.com/r/calvinandhobbes/comments/6yeryr/chocolate_frosted_sugar_bombs/

The fact that the Glenmorangie largely avoids this peril gave me renewed respect for Dr. Bill's skills at handling cask maturation, and of course it was interesting to read his account of their development process in that nonjatta interview regarding the Bacalta.
A ""poor match"" indeed. I also got that impression with the 2016 Cairdeas, the sweetness was unbalanced and imposed on the base spirit. This Ballechin was a bit different in that it was just straight up bitter, but still it just didn't jive with the Scotch. Bottom line the wine notes were unpleasant in both"

**Octomore 9.3, 62.9%**

**Nose:** Peaty & briny Islay perfection. Intense octo peat, lumbering & lively, creamy sweet vanilla, tons of clean sharp brine, pastry malt, bright sweet barley, subtle sweet red fruit funk, burnt rubber, sweet ashy char 

**Taste:** Flavor is nimble and lively for an Octomore but still has that huge thick Octo mouthfeel. Caramel and big sweet malt, Intense smoky peat builds to epic proportions, tons and tons of clean sharp brine, creamy sweet vanilla, sugary barley, background fruit candy sweetness. It's very happy and barley-sweet but without losing one bit of it's signature thick Octomore peat

**Finish:** Builds to an insanely huge finish of sweet barley, vanilla, intense sweet briny peat, delicious twang of burnt rubber & minty char that compliments the peat beautifully. Finish lingers for ages and feels very bright and happy in a dark peaty way

*****

An amazing showcase of Barley, peat, and brine with the wood and wine influence staying more balanced. Amazing how much sweet barley is able to get through the intense Octomore peat, and it's all so clean and briny and huge. How the hell does Bruichladdich combine so many crazy barrels into one super young and super peaty Scotch, and not only is not a mess but it's just breathtakingly good. This is great even by Octomore standards

I'm sipping this as I read your notes and you pretty much nailed them.

As much as love this level of complexity in an Octomore, I'm in the small camp of people that prefer the 10.3 ever so slightly. Less layers than the 9.3 for sure but each layer in the 10.3 is so pure and vivid. I'm going to do a side by side review with them at some point soon but waiting for the bottles to breathe a bit more to get them at their peak.
Great review of a great bottle! Cheers!
Great review and you nailed the tasting notes. I just polished off my bottle last week. This was my favourite scotch out of the 50 or so I have tried.
Great review.  

The folks at Bruichladdich work some magic with Octomore.  As I recall there is a quote from Jim McEwan stating ""it shouldn't work, but somehow it does"".  And somehow the .3 releases always elevate that craft to an even higher level.  Unfortunately they always elevate the price to another level, but that's life.  It's hard to put your finger on why, but when you try the Bruichladdich Islay Barley and the PC Islay Barley, you can start to see those pieces come together to make the Octomore Islay Barley.  Still I can't quite say, ""this is what differentiates it.""
It was a great pour. I'm on my last bottle unfortunately :( thoroughly enjoyed every pour!! Great review.
Great review! I love this one too, it can swing with any of the other .3s imo.
Right on, sounds like fun! Part of the fun of Octomore is all the different releases and variety to be found. Looking forward to your sbs, hopefully I catch it
Thanks! Glad you liked this one and glad you could relate to my notes
Thanks, and yes it is
Totally agree, .3 just seems to be peak Octomore in my experience"

*****

**Smooth Ambler Old Scout Bourbon (MGP) 5yr, K&L pick, 58.1%**

**Nose:** Orange, charred toasted wood, brown sugar, sweet vanilla, metallic caramel, young sweet corn funk. Sweet and toasted and slightly funky/musty

**Taste:** Pop of orange and burnt caramel, toasted wood, brown sugar, smoky char, vanilla, harsh spice, slight tannic bite. Great flavor, sweet and toasted, mouthfeel is a little thin and quick

**Finish:** Sweet corn, orange woody caramel, clean toasted oak, slight lingering bitterness

*****

This is a really beautiful Bourbon that is just a bit rough around the edges. Maybe a tad too young. Orange caramel and brown sugar sweetness I often get from MGP Bourbon, lots of delicious flavor but there's some bitterness and funky notes and the mouthfeel is lacking a bit. A few more years in the barrel and this stuff might be heavenly. I think these were $50 at K&L, totally enjoyable for the price.

This sounds like a good one especially with the orange on the pallet and finish. I've been pleasantly surprised by some of these young SAOS picks
This stuff is pretty darn average at best. I've bought a few and tasted multiple bottles. It's the first bottle of bourbon that I returned to a liquor store. Its okay, but not $50 with of okay. 

I'm getting pretty burned out on these 4-5 year MGP bourbon and ryes.
Loved this one! I have a backup to get into someday :p
That's a bummer to hear. I'm drinking cask 23849 from them and it's heavenly.
Where are you able to get those samples from ?
This was my first time trying one of these new young SAOS barrels. I'm impressed, for the price it's a great Bourbon
With you ATX. They‚Äôve been popping up in MN and a few I‚Äôve had that are from Indiana have been really strong. (I stay away from those sourced in Tenn) Glad to see SOAS back to bringing the good stuff after a few rough years.
Are you not a fan of younger bourbons in general?
From friends that bought the bottle and then let me try some
Come to WV and you can get them for $35. Damn hard to beat at that price.
Me too, their new rye was surprisingly good too
Is anyone a fan? It seems that most people enjoy whiskeys in the 7-15 yr range.
Lots of folks seem to keep buying younger craft stuff.
And most if it isn't that great. New Riff included.
Actually think New Riff SiB/Picks are better than current 5yr MGPs. And I may be butthurt b/c I remember all my SAOS 7yr MGP Honey barrels that were killer, and cheaper than stuff today, ughh
Gotta support craft distilleries early on in their own distillate or they‚Äôll all die out and all you‚Äôll be able to get is the same bottles from the same 4 distilleries. Obviously this isn‚Äôt original distillate, but new riff is.
Great stuff. At first I wasn't to thrilled with these SW 7r GPM store picks, but with some air they've really opened up into something pretty spectacular. Which creates a problem. I would rather drink my Moreno's 7yr Smoke Wagon over Rare Breed any day of the week. Moreno's SW isn't an A rated bourbon. I would rather drink one of these 14 yr Untitled MGP store picks that have the flooded Chicago area over the Moreno's pick, but there not close to being an A+ rated whiskey.
I was initially critiquing these OS 5yr MGP over priced and oversaturated bottles.

They just aren't that good"

**Rossville Union Rye Barrel Proof, 56.3%**

**Nose:** Caramel, brash and peppery Rye spice, flash of harsh wood, thin cherry. Nice Rye action but kind of astringent and lacking complexity

**Taste:** Big peppery and spicy Rye, brash, tinny caramel, hot cherry and spice, some quick gritty wood notes. Flash of hot & harsh flavor, not much here to grab you 

**Finish:** Hot peppery spice, herbal notes, thin caramel, longish spicy finish without a whole lot of flavor

*****

Decent spicy Rye action, but it's brash and it all hits you in a flash without much flavor or complexity. I'm a big fan of MGP Rye, so I was hoping for more from their own house bottling. It's basically enjoyable and a nice spicy Rye, but I've had other MGP sourced Rye's in the 4-6 year range recently that were much better than this.

It's pretty tasty, I very much enjoy the store pick I got.
I'd probably give this a 6 by the skin of its teeth. Its worth noting that it is not the same 95/5 rye that MGP is famous for, but rather a little different mash. Still good, but not quite the same as a good 4-6yr 95/5 MGP BP rye, and at ~$65 youre better off finding a 4yr Bone Snapper ($50) or a 6yr Senator ($75)...
I rate this a bit higher than a 5 (maybe high 6 low 7). I find it very easy to sip for the proof, no offensive flavors, and really well balanced with dill, spice, and a little fruityness. I'm still relatively new to ryes but I think this is pretty on par with WFE 4yr which most folks seem to like.
I have the Savory and and it's a store pick. I'm a fan of it.
Like you, I'm an MGP rye fanboy and went into this with high hopes. Meh, not bad but far from great. FWIW, I enjoyed the non-BP version quite a bit more. 

Have you tried Bulleit 12yr? Loved the hell out of that, enough to be the first time I‚Äôve bought a case of whiskey.
Is your store pick a single barrel? What are the specs on it? Sounds interesting
I had no idea this wasn't 95/5 mashbill, thanks for the info. Looks like it's a blend of 51% and 95% Rye mashbills. Geez, I'm liking this stuff less all the time. Seems like a misguided decision since the 95/5 is what all us fanboys chase. And totally agree on Bonesnapper and Senator, those are 2 specific bottlings I had in mind when I mentioned better MGP out there. The standard 4yr Xray I would put slightly better than this, but some store picks I've had have been great. And the 6yr Senator is delicious.
>Like you, I'm an MGP rye fanboy

I know you are, I remember you haha. And no I haven't actually tried that stuff. Maybe I should
It‚Äôs BIB, 2020, barrel #212, and a store pick. It doesn‚Äôt say single barrel, however, it is barrel #212 so maybe it is? 

It‚Äôs great stuff, honestly some of the better of younger Ryes I‚Äôve had. I‚Äôd rate it a solid 6 based on the store pick I was able to get.
I have 6 different store picks of this..  really interesting range of flavor.."

**Nose:** Thick peat and smoky bbq smells, smoked meat, deep thick fudgey chocolate, menthol char, burnt rubber, dark grape, tart fruits, sweet bubbly wine, minty spice,heavy medicinal peat and brine. Classic thick octomore nose, more chocolatey Bourbon barrel with background sweetness

**Taste:** More sweetness comes through with tons of heavy Octo peat and rich chocolatey notes. Sweet creamy melding of chocolate, vanilla, and huge thick smoke. Brine, caramel, big bbq smoked meat, fleeting bubbly tart wine notes, chocolatey toasted wood, creamy vanilla and cherry filling. Thick and meaty mouthfeel (giggity)

**Finish:** Creamy vanilla, chocolate, thick barley sweetness, big thick smooth smoke and chocolatey charred brine, menthol. Finish builds huge but then ends just a tad too quick for an Octomore, a minor complaint. 

*****

One of my favorite Octomores was the 4.2 Comus which was also aged in Sauternes, although it was much younger. This is nothing like that release. This has very heavy Bourbon barrel influence to me with lots of vanilla and rich chocolate notes, the wine sweetness is more subtle and backgroundish. Classic Octo thickness and intense smoke. Octomore is in a league of it's own, there's just nothing like it. Even if this isn't one of my favorite releases it's an amazing Islay Scotch by any measure and another amazing Octomore.

Excellent review!
I agree, this is really approachable, great stuff.
Nice review. If this isnt a top release for you given your description then the top ones must be something truly special.

Have you had a chance to try the 10.3 or 6.1? Those are the only two available in my area and I am considering picking one up. If you've tried either i'd be interested to hear your opinion.
Fabulous dram.
56.9% sounds a little harsh, no problems though?
Lovely read! Hopefully I can try it sometime hehe!
Is it possible to obtain this whiskey?
Definitely agree on the vanilla. This ended up being my last favorite of the 10s, but I know some people adored it!
Your reviews are great, but I skimmed this going, ah yes, I stick a different area of chimney into my mouth with this one.
>Octomore 10.2

Brilliant review.  Thanks for the information. I am sorely tempted. Question: how much (ok, this is a difficult one to answer) sweetness comes through?  I like sweetness, but not always in my Scotch, just my licorice.  PS: Horrible fact: a man died in the last few weeks by consuming too much black licorice.  Drained some needed nutrients out of his system apparently.  Google it. True, but sad.
I mean it definitely packs a punch if you're mainly used to standard 40-46% scotch. But cask strength is pretty much all I drink these days. This is actually a bit light for an octo if anything, many are right around 60% give or take
The .2's are travel retail exclusives, so probably cant get it in the US. But FineDrams has it for about $170 if you wanna order it from overseas.
It's an online exclusive this year. You can buy it directly from their webpage.
Indeed! Its pretty impressive how much octomore can stand out amongst all the other peated islay scotch
This is not very sweet at all for a wine aged octomore. Its always a balanced sweetness anyway. But this is heavier on the bourbon barrel to me, the sweetness is more vanilla and barrel notes
Cool!"

**Old Perth Blended Malt, Cask Strength Red Wine finish No. 2 LE, 62.3%**

**Nose:** Wood, hot allspice, floral, caramel, grassy malt, banana funk, vanilla, toffee, sweet malt. Nose is nice, hot and slightly funky malt, doesn't scream wine finish

**Taste:** Sticky sweet caramel, vanilla, hot peppery spice, sweet tart berry and very subtle wine funk but it's masked behind a lot of spice. Some water mellows the spice and brings out more sweet barley and grassy malt. Still not a whole lot of wine influence to be found, there's maybe a smooth and very subtle fruit sweetness that melds with the grassy malt

**Finish:** Wine sweetness brightens up more on the finish, with sweet barley malt and vanilla, some bitter wood. Water smooths out the spice kick into a mellow peppery menthol

*****

A decent little malt. It's mostly peppery-hot and malty, I'm not really getting much red wine here. There's maybe a subtle background sweetness and funk. If you're looking for deep red color and wine saturated sweetness this is not it. More of a very subtle wine finish. Still a tasty Scotch though for the price, and it takes water well

"Review #189: Bunnahabhain 11 2009 ""The Ultimate,"" 1st fill sherry 67%",,https://i.redd.it/16cb2mlacru51.jpg,"u/bradbobaggins

*****

**Bunnahabhain 11yr 2009, The Ultimate Whisky Company, first fill sherry #900073, 67%**

**Nose:** Honey, rich soft sherry, warm spice, black cherry, prune, orange, toffee, vanilla, dark toasted wood, thick malt, chocolate. Soft, richly sweet and balanced

**Taste:** Rich caramel, dark cherry sweetness and big spice build huge, gritty graham cracker and barrel char, strawberry, chocolate, big toasted oakiness, tobacco, tart sweet berries.  At 67% I was afraid of too much heat, but this is just huge and flavorful

**Finish:** Builds huge with luxurious sticky sweet cherry and big hot spice, sweet toffee and graham cracker, vanilla, lingering charred sweets. Long sweet and hot finish, I really love it

*****

Excellent stuff. Not an average sherry bomb, it isn't completely soft and saturated and the high ABV makes for some dramatic and amazingly huge flavor. Just keeps building bigger. It isn't simply just ""hot."" Lots of spice sure but also lots of dark lively sweetness and interesting barrel notes, charred and gritty and savory. It's huge and hot but balances all these flavors really well.

That is the highest % I've seen
This one sure isn‚Äôt subtle, but it‚Äôs definitely got plenty of stuffing to try to keep up with the ABV, IMHO. Thanks for sharing the note!
Great review! I have a bottle from cask 900075, bottled by SV @ 68,5%.
Going by your notes it seems we have very similar bottles, so you made the better deal!
Did they store that cask in hell? Seems like the angels couldn't get  to it.
I‚Äôm never tried a scotch higher than around 40 must be very different
Thanks for sharing this review!!
That is one high abv with lots going on - great review.
Yeah this might be the highest ABV I've seen on a Scotch, but just by a bit. I had a [Signatory sherried Glenlivet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/bqns8j/review_93_glenlivet_11_signatory_the_whisky/) that was 66.8%
SCN Craigellachie 10 (US release 4) has it by the slightest - 67.3% 

There might be some others even higher, but I believe most pot stills are optimal for flavor and maturation at 68-70%.
Sure thing! Makes great use of the ABV for sure
I keep seeing that bottle at a Japanese retailer‚Äôs site and being tempted, but I feel like it would kick my ass and leave for dead by the side of the road.
Haha I dont know for sure. Bourbon has a rule where it cannot be barreled any higher than 62.5%. Scotch doesn't have this rule, so I suspect stuff like this was just barreled at a high proof. That might be why you mainly see these crazy ABV's in sherried scotch, because it will pick up so much flavor from the cask and mask it a bit. Distilleries will also barrel stuff at high strength like that if they intend to age it for a long time so that the Angel's dont drop it down to 40% too quickly
Thanks for reading!
Thanks, it was a fun one dude. It's on finedrams right now
There's an octomore bottled at 70%, it's called x4+10
It's honestly not super hot, in the sense of being very ethanol forward. The alcohol is much better integrated than similarly proofed bourbons imo.

Go for it if it's your jam, but in the end it's just a slightly higher proof
It does sounds like a good one. Ah, so it is,thx. So, even with the high abv, it‚Äôs not hot?
Yeah, for sure.  Bunna in sherried IBs can be sublime at very high proofs - and young ages.  I have a 10-YO Blackadder Raw Cask at 61.4 which is one of my favorite bottles of the past few years."

*****

**Benriach 13yr 1997, Virgin Oak cask 3279, 56.3%**

**Nose:** Toasted oak, light tannins, wood spice, hot menthol and cherry, mint, vanilla, some warm rounded malty funk, with air lots of chocolate and sweet char. It's spicy with lots of menthol, I feel like I might even guess this as a Rye blind.

**Taste:** Much more Scotchy on the palate after that spicy American nose. Thick smoothly sweet malt with rich heavy caramel, sweet vanilla, heavy but mellow wood spice, chocolatey toasted wood, slight tannic bite. Nice balance of malty mouthfeel and smooth chocolatey wood notes with just a slight tannic and spicy bite, lots of sweet malt & wood. Big complex flavor

**Finish:** Thick malt and rich woody caramel, light tannic oak, sweet vanilla, lingering root beer char and sugary barley. Long sweet and complex finish.

*****

This is my first virgin oak matured Scotch, and it's everything I could have hoped for. Nice balance of rich wood notes with a smooth, warm malty Scotch mouthfeel. I've had 1st fills that are way more ""unpleasantly oaky"" and tannic than this. It's sweet in a fun way that plays between sweet barley and sweet wood notes. Big and complex flavor, it's delicious but also very interesting and different. I love it.

**Taste:** Chocolate, caramel, warm toned-down grape, big & dry tannic wood, vanilla, light and breezy mouthfeel but with rich oaky flavors, cherry cola, smooth grape

**Finish:** Light finish, delicious flavor. Grape drink and caramel, light chocolatey wood and vanilla.mouracs #15

*****

I usually prefer higher proof yaks, but it's fun venturing into a lower proof bottling here. This is an oaky one, so it's actually nice getting the dark and dry tannic oak flavors but toned down to a lower proof to make it more drinkable. High proof and over-oaked isn't always a winning combo. Nice balance of tannic wood, chocolatey richness, and smooth mellow fruits. It's low ABV is noticable, but it's great stuff with absolutely no off notes to be found

Nice review, thanks for this
Nice review. Has anyone compared this cask to the Lincoln Road cask (#25?)?
Thanks for the review!
I'm not sure. I kinda thought this is the one people were going gaga for at Lincoln road but I'm not 100% sure. Was that an actual pick they did, different from this one?

I could be confusing it with a different store too
I'm not entirely certain but I think Lincoln Rd took the entire cask #25 while #15 was distributed in EU."
"Reviews #185-187, Caol Ila Unpeated vertical (15, 17, and 18)",,https://i.redd.it/7a74sowezys51.jpg,"Big fan of malty Scotch, and Caol Ila actually does it really well with these annual ""unpeated"" special releases. So I decided to a sbs. Samples courtesy of @Dilettante

*****

**Caol Ila Unpeated 2015, 17yr 55.9%**

**Nose:** Thick and beautiful nose, impressive right off the bat. Rich toffee, thick buttery malt, tons of brine, ashy smoke(how?), chocolatey and rich, toasted marshmallow, vanilla, toasted charred wood, menthol char

**Taste:** Amazing mouthfeel, thick and viscous with complex flavor. Bright caramel, clean brine, rich gritty toffee, thick pastry malt, barley sugar, zingy charred menthol, sweet ashy char, rich vanilla, tart bright berry. The malt and fruits build big and sweet but never loses that toffee richness, with delicious briny & charred notes

**Finish:** Thick sweet cereal malt rides out a long time with vanilla and sweet ashy char, some light briny smoke. Long beautiful finish

* Wow this is a zinger. Rich malt bomb with some really delicious brine and sweet char notes, and I swear a little lingering smoke. The ash and charred vanilla and brine elevates this above your average malt bomb, gives it kind of a meaner edge. But it all balances together beautifully, an excellent Scotch.

**9/10**

*****

**Caol Ila Unpeated 2017, 18yr 59.8%**

**Nose:** Sweet, thick, and malty. So nice. Sweet barley sugar, rich cereal malt, dessert pastry, bitter toffee, milk chocolate, big clean caramel & sea salt, sweet vanilla icing, thick and malty, citrus, bright fruits, menthol and sweet char

**Taste:** Sweet complex barley notes explode and coat the mouth. Thick sugary pastry malt, sweet thick barley, cake frosting, thick sweet vanilla, gritty thick caramel and bright happy malt, sticky-sweet dark toffee, bright sweet fruits, toasted wood, mellow deep wood spice. Huge and amazingly complex, the malt just ""pops"" but also has a mellow layer of delicious wood spice and lots of deeper richness.

**Finish:** Sweet barley and dessert pastry malt rides out a long time with cool menthol spice, sweet vanilla char. Super long and delicious finish, sweet and malty.

* As if in answer to the unconventional briny and charred maltiness of 2015, they made this super sweet and barley rich malt bomb, and they did it to near perfection. It's ridiculously complex and huge, all the flavor explodes but at the same time it flows effortlessly and balanced. This is a proper malt BOMB, and I think it's my favorite of the 3.

**9.5/10**

*****

**Caol Ila Unpeated 2018, 15yr 59.1%**

**Nose:** Thick, malty, and a bit spicy. Toffee, lots of menthol and spice, dark chocolate, toasted oak, thick sweet malt, vanilla, banana funk, lightly tannic wood must. Nice rich woody malt notes with a nice layer of spice

**Taste:** Thick pastry malt, spice zing, grassy cereal, sweet barley, rich sweet caramel, smooth vanilla, toasted wood, flash of hot spice on the tail end

**Finish:** Spice builds big and lively with sweet pastry malt and vanilla, leaves sweet and mouth numbing spicy.

* Another nice malt bomb, it's definitely the most woody and spicy of the three. Thick malt notes are on point, lots of pastry and cereal sweetness with nice rich wood notes. Spice heat is not an ethanol burn, it's more of a peppery spice and numbing menthol kind of layer. It's a bit too spicy and hot I think, but overall it's well-executed and an interesting expression even if it's not my thing.

**7/10**

*****

**TL;DR Summary:** These are all really nice malt bombs. 2015 17yr has a mean charred and briny edge, 2017 18yr is more traditional sweet thick malt bomb, and 2018 15yr is a bit too hot and spicy

Definitely great stuff... it's a shame they have cut it from the line of special releases. It was never widely popular, but not sure why Cardhu or Cragganmore would garner more attention.

I'm sniffing the 2015 now and it's just fantastic on the nose.

I used to buy the Lagavulin and the Caol Ila from the yearly release, now it's the Lagavulin and the Talisker -- both amazing, but the Caol Ila was a special treat as it's so different from the normal expression.
Awesome side-by-side, thank you. I looked all over for the 18yr, but am happy with my bottle of 17yr, which has been open a few months now. It's so bloody quiet at first, though-- really doesn't prepare you for the onslaught of flavor, and if I had just the neck pour to go on, it'd be disappointing. Do you know if your samples for it and the 15yr were taken after the bottles had been breathing for a while?
What a line up! 

It's hard to discern where which notes were from the core Caol Ila spirit and which were from the casks. What notes would you say were signature to the spirit?
Nice reviews! I have the 2014 (15 year old, 60.39%) and the 2015 you reviewed. They are magnificent.
I grabbed the 18yr a couple years back on sale for $100 and thought it might be decent.  It's a HUGE whisky and your notes are spot on.  Cheers!
Nice reviews. All of these sound delish. Great notes, really love malt bombs.
I‚Äôm fairly new to reddit so don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs allowed to comment on an older post, apologies if this is not allowed.


I recently managed to get two bottles of the 2017 18y/o unpeated caol ila (loved it). I heard so much about it and this was one of the reviews that made me go for it. 
This is only my third cask strength since I got into whisky. 


My question is, wouldn‚Äôt one expect a lower abv on a cask strength whisky of 18y compared to a younger cask strength, due to angels share? 
Thank you
Great reviews, love the notes! I'm with you on all these, that 2017 is one of my all-time favourites.
Excellent reviews.  There isn't much in scotch I don't like, but a solid malt forward whisky definitely sits near the top of my list.  I've almost taken these home with me so many times.
Ah finally, there is the 17. I'd like to get my hands on a bottle of that joooos. Surprised the 18 was only a 7 for you. I also found it hot and peppery but it takes down after 6 or so months open.
Great reviews! I got the 18 year because of all the good reviews. I have to break it out tonight and try it now. Cheers and Sl√°inte.
I didn't realize these were discontinued, fuck. We can never have nice things. A cask strength, decently aged release like this was just too good to be true for very long. Bummer
I know the 17 is below the halfway mark, and I'm pretty sure they have probably both been open for quite some time. I had a similar experience with the 18. First bit of the bottle was a letdown compared to the sample I had, then it opened up over time and its glorious now.
The main thing that stands out among all 3 is how complex the barley notes are. It was difficult to nail down in a review. The base malt flavor was simultaneously rich and thick and bright and sweet and viscous and happy tasting, and so much more. Otherwise I might say the brine for my two favorites(2015 & 2017), but there wasn't much brine in the 2018.
Thanks! Awesome you have one of these gems, I havent got to try that one
No problem at all! Angel's share isn't that exact of a thing. Different factors can effect the evaporation. First of all, casks are made of wood which is a living thing that has slight variations. Different trees of different ages, different parts of the tree, or different growing conditions will result in minutely different densities and imperfections that let's wood casks ""breathe"" differently

Where a cask is stored can make a difference. Big distilleries might age their stuff in several different warehouses that have different climates and effect the evaporation differently. And even within a warehouse there's temperature variations which makes casks at different spots age differently. This can be seen more dramatically with Bourbon which is aged in a hotter climate, and abv can actually go up or down depending on where in the rickhouse a cask is stored. 

Two different whiskies that are distilled in different years might have seen different weather patterns at different times in their life, hotter or colder years etc. 

Another factor, although I don't know if it's an issue here, is the abv of the Whisky when it enters the cask. There is no rule for this. 62.5% is basically considered an ideal entry strength for whisky, but some distilleries might go higher or lower depending on different factors

So there's lots of stuff that can effect it. There might be even more factors I don't know of or can't think of right now.
Thanks, I remember you're a fan so I'm glad you found the reviews haha. Yeah that 2017 is amazing stuff. I would put 2015 right up there with it if you get a chance
Thanks, and totally agree I love a well done malt bomb. It can be a difficult thing to pull off well like these do
I implore you, do so good sir. Scoop 'em up!
I think it easily could have scored higher but drinking it along with these other 2 amazing bottles hurt it a bit. Hard to compete. It's still great stuff just a little too spicy for me
Thanks for reading! I hope you like it. I just commented this with someone else, but mine was a bit closed on the neck pour and beginning of the bottle, if you don't love it give it some time and it will open up beautifully
Yeah it's terrible! 

To correct myself before someone else, it's technically not really discontinued as it's a yearly special release and Diageo does switch several of the bottles up... but it had been a dependable yearly release since 2006 or so... which is why I consider it discontinued.
I keep hoping they have more of this stock aging and are just skipping a few years. I really wonder what this profile could be like at 22-25 years old.
I've noticed that quirk several times with malty ex-bourbon Scotch like this. They can be really tight and need time to realize their full potential. But once they unlock, they're fantastic-- probably my favorite profile right now.
Out of curiosity, how much time are we talking about here before it got really good?
I think there's a undercurrent of people highlighting and appreciating the malt bombs, much in the way that sherry bombs had and have their fanfare.

Ben Nevis, Longmorn, Benromach to name a few are getting their due. Nice to see Caol Ila among them. My only experience is with the 12yr which I found too conservative
I've never tried an unpeated caol Ila but I love the standard expression and I get overwhelming brine from it! Interesting that it seems to carry into the unpeated one too
This is very helpful information. Thank you so much!
I've tried the 2015 as well, I thought it was also great but not quite at the level of the 2017. I guess I'm a sucker for malt bombs!
I knew where a 2015 17 was hanging about taunting me, so...
They are all delicious.
It was very good. I didn‚Äôt need to add water at all but did to see if it was different.
Totally agree
I wasn't constantly popping it to see so I can't say exactly when it changed, but I left it alone for about 3-4 months with a pour here and there, and by the time it got to the 3/4 full mark it's opened up a lot
I might be reading too much into it, but maybe this also tracks with people appreciating lighter lagers in the beer world more instead of just bigger and hoppier IPAs. A common thread of highlighting nuanced and understated flavors.
>I guess I'm a sucker for malt bombs!

Same!
If I was you, I'd clear em out at the right price!!
Interesting, I also have a somewhat disappointing bottle at the moment which is why I asked, fingers crossed it will improve in a few months.
Or maybe it's a common narrative in hobbies like this. You discover the big flavors, the heavy hitters, but then you get worn out and suddenly something light like a lager or weissbier or a Glencadam
As someone who loves craft beer but cant stand IPA, I like this analogy. Peat and sherry, much like hops in beer, can turn into an arms race sometimes to see who can make it bigger and more aggressive. A good malt bomb just takes a lot of quality and skill and time, to let the spirit shine on it's own in a balanced and enjoyable way."

*****

**Ancient Age Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 3yr, 40%**

**Nose:** Caramel and fruits, honey, light vanilla, musty wood and sweet funky corn, orange. A bit musty and funky maybe but basically inoffensive and pleasant

**Taste:** Obviously light at 40%, but not overly so and it's pretty tasty. Mellow warm sweetness, orange caramel, honey, mild funk, sweet corn, light wood, vanilla. Pleasant, doesn't have any harshness or young ethanol burn and doesn't feel too watered down at the proof

**Finish:** Sweet corn and caramel, mild spice and youthful funk 

*****

I really like this for what it is. At 3 years and 40% it performs well as a sipper, nice flavor and not overly washed out or light feeling. There's some young corn/wood funk that could be a turn off but I feel like it's light enough to just add a little fun complexity instead.

Great everyday sipper for the price, I think.
I should not have done this, but I drank a bottle all in one sitting; I will not likely purchase it again after that experience.
How does it compared to Ancient Ancient Age 10 Star? I've always heard terrible things about the 10 stars.
Personally I really enjoy ancient age.
Per [this article](https://uproxx.com/life/cheap-bourbons-with-same-mash-bills-as-expensive-bourbons/) Ancient Age has the same mash bill as Blantons and should be a cheap alternative. Can anyone speak to that?
Way better than Blantons.
Thanks.
doesnt it have to be at least 4 years if its a straight bourbon with no age statement?
Forget the age...it's a nice easy sipping, pleasant inexpensive pour me another bourbon lovers dram!
This used to be my house brand. For the price, the bit doesn't get much better. 
Ancient Ancient, as we called it, the 90 proof, is a good purchase as well.
Agreed!
Ha ha, I know this one. Somewhere in the mid-70's, I did that to a bottle of OGD. Drank rum for the next twenty years or so.
I have all 3 Ancient Age at the house - regular Ancient Age, 10 star, and 90 proof. I like them all but the regular Ancient Age is my [favorite. ](https://favorite.No)such a great value.
Haven't had the 10 star, or any other Ancient Age to compare sorry
It reminded me a lot of Blanton's actually, has that mellow warmth and orange caramel vibe I get from Blantons. No idea if that's true or not though
Same mash bill, yes. Also used for Rock Hill Farms, Hancock‚Äôs, and Elmer T. Lee. That does not mean that you will think you‚Äôre drinking any of those when you pour Ancient Age, but I‚Äôve found that it makes a nice cocktail for fans of those bourbons.
Well that's a hot take
I use this to cut the proof on some of my barrel proof favs!
2 I think.
You see, it wasn‚Äôt really the Ancient Age that got me, it was the 4 oz of OGD 114 and the two PBRs that I drank after that really got me. I did not puke or blackout, but I was a lil nauseous
Ancient Age IS the new Blanton's/Rock Hill Farms. Soon it will be highly allocated and priced at $99.99 ü§£
why not just add water?
[according to this random website](https://whiskeyid.com/the-rules-of-american-whiskey/), straight bourbon requires and age statement if its less than 4 years
Has to be aged minimum 2 years to be bourbon whiskey and 4 to be straight bourbon whiskey
Not the guy your asking, but blending can be fun sometimes. I could see this working well as a blender to smooth out something hot
any whiskey product in the US requires an age statement if less than 4 years‚Äô old. so NAS is assumed to be more than 4 YO.

to be labeled straight, a whiskey has to be more than two years‚Äô old.

A 3 YO bourbon can be labeled straight but must state the age because it is less than 4 YO
Just looked up the prices in my Total Wine...$11.50!!! That has to be the cheapest bourbon I know of.  Now I get why it may be fun to cut with.

Ed: Ok, it's actually not as cheap as Benchmark, or EW Green Label, and same price as EW Black Label. Together they would make for an interesting flight.
Heaven Hill Old Style is $7. Not great stuff, however."
"Review #184: Ardbeg Drum, Committee Release 52%",,https://i.redd.it/cvrt4zm507s51.jpg,"Courtesy of u/TheAgaveFairy

*****

**Ardbeg Drum Committee Release, 52%**

**Nose:** Big sweetly charred peat, vanilla, creamy dessert sweetness, tons of sweet gritty char, mean heavy boggy peat, brine and spice

**Taste:** Huge flavor, clean and creamy sweet and so fucking peaty. Huge clean peat, sweet gritty char and vanilla, caramel, sugary pastry, heavy peaty brine, massive ashy and charred peat. Sweet and creamy in a dessert pastry kind of way but the clean peat is still front and center. Delicious stuff

**Finish:** sweet heavy char, sweet sweet sweet vanilla, massive peat. Lingers with creamy sweetness and super clean peat

*****

It's a massive peat monster, but it's amazingly clean and flavorful with a lot of delicious creamy dessert sweetness here too. Extremely well executed and delicious, it's a different kind of peat monster for sure. Huge flavor, amazing stuff

**Score: 8/10**
I have always wondered how much of the flavor on something aged in a rum cask really changes things.  Most rum, is rested for an extremely short period of time.
Great whisky and a favorite for me. Everyone talks about pineapple, but I get HUGE burnt banana bread notes, especially as the bottle has breathed a bit over the last year.
Local shop has a bottle for $120. Worth that price?
I like Lagavulin 16 and it‚Äôs my go to scotch. How would you compare this to Lag 16? Is  Ardberg 10 similar and worth buying to expand my tastes to other peaty whiskies? This one is likely rare and very difficult to find.
Just ordered it shipped from Mission Wines & Spirts in Pasadena.  Should have it by Monday.  I'll let you know, but looking forward to it.
Wow, tough crowd. :)

 Called it ""delicious"" 3 times, ""extremely well executed,"" and ""amazing stuff,""  and still only an 8 out of 10. 

What kept it from the coveted 9 spot for you? Too much peat?
Glad you‚Äôre on team Drum!
I've had other rum cask whiskies, and to me the influence is subtle. It doesn't just taste like rum. It tends to add a thick creamy kind if sweetness like this one I find. If you want to try one look for the balvenie Caribbean cask, its delicious stuff and its readily available.
It changes a lot..  rums are usually matured Caribbean or very hot countries where the maturation much quicker then for example in Scotland. Also rum casks are usually just for finish the whisky to give an extra touch.
I can see banana for sure. I get a lot of sweet notes I would usually associate more with malty bourbon barrel, but thicker and creamier and still strong alongside the peat
I got a lot of banana on this too
I came here to say this. Pineapple is on the box, so maybe it's influencing people? I don't get pineapple, but a ton of banana. 

My tasting notes have both caramelised banana and 'fake banana', like the banana flavouring in sweets. It's a pretty unique note and I really like it.
$120 is probably the 46% standard version, this one I reviewed is the 52% committee release which is more like $150. If they are selling the 52% version for $120 absolutely get it. I can't really speak for the 46% stuff, but I would pass at that price
If you like Lagavulin 16, it's definitely worth expanding and trying other Islay. Laphroaig 10 or Ardbeg 10 would be a great place to go from Laga. They are a little more raw with meaner peat. Talisker 10 is a good non-Islay to check out, really good stuff. Don't worry about these limited editions yet, lots of great stuff out there that is cheaper and more consistent
Just so you know, that's the 46% version. It's a little different but I'll bet it's still fantastic. It's just the proofed down version of this 52% ""committee release"" I reviewed
Scoring is so subjective, and it's always a difficult part for me. I think 9 and 10 are tough for a drink to reach for me. 9 is basically a perfect Scotch, and 10 is transcendental. I might be a little too rough on things, you could realistically even move everything up a point lol.
It's a pleasure! I havent been a big fan of ardbeg LE's until this one. They usually feel a little too tame and boring. This one is a monster
I haven't had this one but the other rum cask scotches I've had were the same.  I think if the cask were ex-Hampden or an ex-Martinique french oak, it would be perhaps a different story.
I‚Äôll have to go check out which version it is. I go there solely for their better Ardbeg prices compared to the Total Wine I usually frequent.
I got the standard Drum and next to our other Ardbegs (5, 10, Corry, Uige and even the An Oa) it‚Äôs collecting dust....
Cool. Thanks. I realize that I am in the league of extraordinary connoisseurs and folks who love their scotch. Life is learning and I have just started this. 

On a side note, I also got a  Glenmorangie Nectar D‚ÄôOr and was not at all impressed with it. I realized that the fruity, floral  and winey characters are not to my liking and also it is not sweet enough to be a post dinner drink. I may be way off as I have only consumed a few Lagavulin 16s and am a wine drinker.
Yes, I could tell by the 92 proof when I ordered it was not quite the same.. Sorry, meant to clarify, but for $99 USD did not expect to get the same one you reviewed.. I am afraid can't find that version locally yet, so I'll take what i can find in SoCal. By the time I've finished with the 46 i may be able to find the 52 pc by someone who will ship here.  For higher proofs in the meantime I''ll have to be content with the cask strengths  Amrut (Peated),  Ofrog,  and  Lag 12 (that went for $159 USD). And, fk, at 76 years old I don't mind a milder, proofed down version now and then.  My 6 grandchildren already think I''m a wimp anyway and feel that I happily spending their inheritance on Scotch and whiskey.  My wife (at 72) only drinks Bourbon, Irish (green dot) and wine (and a good deal of weed)..  So, happily, she won't touch my liquor.
Most rum cask are ex-bourbon cask. And the main reason that I keep wondering about it is rum production is extremely seasonal, with lots of the cask being empty for months on end.  The typical rum aging time is just a few month, and they heavily wash the cask afterwards.  Even anejo rums are best aged 2-3 years, (the ones with the 8-30 year aging is more marketing than production quality choice).  

I personally don‚Äôt see the cask having the ability to hold the flavor of something like sherry or port(late bottled port, the producers typically dump the cask, because they impart a strong flavor if they are reused for port) which have held the contents for 10+ years.
Sure thing! Scotch is a big world, learning and trying new stuff is a lot of fun. Sorry you don't care for the Nectar D'Or. I really liked it, but everyone's preferences are different. I suggest you give it some time, sometimes a bottle can really open up as the level gets lower and more time passes. Or also as you try more stuff and your palate expands. You might find you enjoy it more down the road or find yourself in an odd mood for something different
Amrut peated cask strength, Laphroaig CS and Lagavulin 12 are some amazing bottles, I wouldn't sweat not being able to find this Ardbeg if that's the kind of stuff you're sipping on! Great Whisky and copious amounts of weed, you guys sound pretty cool lol
That's not quite right. Most sherry casks in the whisky industry are only seasoned with sherry, so they are emptied after only a few months. Also, there are plenty of well-aged rums made in the tropics that undergo intense cask interaction due to the climate."
"Review #176: Blanton's Gold, 51.5%",,https://i.redd.it/bbjroerdder51.png,"This is basically just a higher proof version of standard Blanton's. Regular Blanton's is bottled at 46.5%, while the Gold is bottled at 51.5%. Courtesy of u/MarrowX

*****

**Blanton's Gold Single Barrel, 2/20/20, 51.5%**

**Nose:** Very much straightforward and quintessential Bourbon. Bright corn and lots of orange zest, sweet grain, brown sugar, toasted wood, warm & rich orange caramel, minty spice

**Taste:** Clean caramel and bright corn sweetness, tastes happy. Orange zest, big Bourbon-y corn grain, brown sugar, mint, clean toasted oak, nice peppery spice kick. It seems to effortlessly tick all the classic Bourbon profile boxes and does it really well in a big and flavorful way.

**Finish:** Orange zest and spice kick, brown sugar. Sweet Bourbon finish

*****

I've never been a big fan of Blanton's so I wasn't expecting much from this. But it's fantastic. It has a very classic and quintessential Bourbon feel to it, it hits all the classic Bourbon flavors and does it really well. Big and sweet and happy tasting, very flavorful stuff.

**Score: 7/10**
Found a bottle in duty free Turks and Caicos. Absolutely love it. I may pour a few drinks a year out of it..at least until I can replace it.
Count me as another person who thinks Blanton‚Äôs is perfectly good, enjoyable whiskey... but not at its shelf price and certainly not for anything above that, or with any level of difficulty to obtain.
Wish I could get different versions of it out here.
I‚Äôm picking up one today with the same dump date. Glad to know it‚Äôs a good one! Plus it was dumped on my 35th birthday.
If you can find it retail in Europe it typically seems to cost around EUR80. The distributer in Europe is La Maison du Whisky who have a great store in Paris. Last time I was in their store I picked up a bottle of SFTB.
That‚Äôs a top shelf bottle if I‚Äôve ever seen one.
Great review! I only have the original and straight from the barrel editions but this seems like a pretty happy medium between them. Might have to pick it up if I see it at a decent price.
I looked in duty free stores in London, Tokyo, and Spain and never once saw one of these. :(
I'm not a regular Blanton's fan. Gold sample I had was not great, so definitely not looking for a bottle. I saw it in 2 liquor stores in NY a few weeks ago and it was even more expensive than I thought it would be; more than secondary. 300, I think it was. Can get SFTB for less, and it's delicious.
Is this the new US release or the longstanding overseas import? The reason I ask is that since the US release is a once-yearly one, they might be choosier with their barrel selection for that market.
I know everyone shits on Blanton's because of the ridiculous secondary prices but the times I've had it, I've enjoyed it.  If you take out the tatering its a very classic, if overpriced, bourbon.  Personally I have no desire to chase after this bottle at secondary prices but I do recognize that its good bourbon.
I manage a liquor store and sold a bottle for $400 last week in Manhattan, New York. Blanton's is good but it's just too over priced. I wouldn't pay $400 for that.
[removed]
Right on, and hope you're able to find another
Blantons is a  fine ~$60 whiskey.  The $100+ prices its getting on the secondary.......just not that good. But what do I know, I have poor mans taste.
Same. I had to call in favors to get an OG bottle. My wife‚Äôs boss‚Äôs husband owns restaurants and he called his distributor to track a bottle down. At least she got it cheap so there‚Äôs that.
I think it's the u.s. release
Yep. Most of these hyped Bourbons were solid bottles *for the price.* and now it's out of control and silly with secondary prices and hype. Blantons is a fine Bourbon, I was just never a big fan of the Buffalo Trace mashbill on this and RHF personally
Why do you rip off your customers?
I used to work for a distributor here in California and I never saw anything other than the original blantons come through.
Older RHF was much better than now. Last 3 bottles of RHF I've had just had a harsh and astringent note in their profiles. My last one, open since last summer, has this acetone note quality to it.

That note comes out strongly on an ice rock which is disappointing. The typical cherry note is there, but with that astringency makes it taste sorta like red cough syrup :(
I told him the price, he googled it and found it was one of the cheapest prices and said he's going to take it. I don't know how that's a rip off. You pay what you think it's worth with alcohol and he deemed it was the right price. For me it was way too expensive. But I understand what you mean."

**Nose:** Luscious sweet fruits, cherry, dark strawberry, zingy tart grape, rich thick honey & caramel, vanilla, some light chocolate wood notes. Dark and sweet with a really nice thick honey undercurrent 

**Taste:** A sherry bomb, silky smooth and thick and sweet. Smooth rich fruits, darkly sweet cherry and strawberry, zingy grape drink, lots of warm vanilla, thick dark caramel and honey, smooth oak, menthol and wood spice. For how big and rich it is it's incredibly balanced and silky smooth, a pleasure to sip on. A bit on the dry side

**Finish:** Sweet dark fruits and some nice zingy peppery spice builds big. It gets candy sweet grape/cherry and spicy, complex and delicious finish

*****

Excellent stuff, all the big flavor and thick mouthfeel of a cask strength sherry bomb but it's so silky smooth and drinkable. Huge dark sweet fruits but it has a nice thick honey and vanilla richness underneath. Not an off note to be found here, beautiful stuff.

**Nose:** Warm sweet fruits, rich rich caramel & malt, milk chocolate, sweet vanilla, caramel toasted wood, smooth sweet mustiness. Very nice balance of fruits, malt and caramel richness. Very ""Scotchy"" and pleasant, delicious nose

**Taste:** Delivers on all the sweet balanced richness the nose promises. Balanced sweet fruitiness, lots of rich toffee and thick sugary malt, sweet vanilla wood notes. So balanced and rich, like the nose it feels quintessential ""Scotch.""

**Finish:** Sweet vanilla, sugary pastry malt, sweet balanced fruits, light char. Very sweet and tasty finish

This is quintessential Scotch to me. It covers a nice balance of fruity and malty sweetness, loads of caramel and toffee, and has a nice rich mouthfeel. Extremely well balanced and well executed, delicious all around. This is about as good as a 12yr OB Scotch gets

This distillery intrigues me. Your review sold me.

I'm going to pick one up.
Thx
The 10 CS (Batch 3, 58.2) is my favorite of their OB.  Huge chocolate and manuka honey bomb.
Glenallachie is awesome stuff. Everything in their core range is delicious.
I enjoyed my bottle, but not as much as you did! Also got some distinct nut notes (almond and walnuts). 
Your review makes me want to get another bottle and try it again though. Great read!
Thanks for the review. It sounds delicious.  I believe this is Billy Walkers latest project so I would expect nothing less. It's at the front of my must buy next list.
I'm with you on that, it has a silly caveman/flintstones vibe to it or something. Distinct, but I like a Scotch bottle to look a little more dignified
I'm just about to finish off a bottle of the 15 which I've finally started to see in my state.  It has been good from the first dram with lots of the same notes, but maybe darker/deeper fruit and chocolate.  Before I kill it, I'm going to do a review side by side with Tamdhu 15 and Glendronach 15.  At this point, I'd definitely rebuy the GlenAllachie 15.
What kinda fruit we talking?
I've been intrigued too. Anyone who bottles at 46% and proudly states no chillfiltering or colour added has my attention. And I think it delivers based on this sample

**WhistlePig 10 Barrel Strength, 57.4%**

**Nose:** Caramel and gritty wood, fizzy cherry cola, clean piercing mint and strong rye spice, chocolatey root beer char. Beautiful Rye nose

**Taste:** Hot zingy Rye spice, hot cherry syrup, toasted wood, sticky caramel, medicinal root beer. Explodes with big fiery Rye spice action. It's a lively and hot one, brash and not super oaky.

**Finish:** Brash Rye spice keeps building big, cherry cola and red hots, Rye heat lingers a long time

*****

For being batched it's quite fiery and lively, I thought it would have been a little more balanced. Luckily I love a lively Rye, so this really works for me. It drinks similar to many WP single barrels out there, maybe just a bit on the lower end of an average pick. But luckily the average pick is fantastic, so this is a great Rye.

Jezze. I just bought a bottle of the 10 and 12. Haven‚Äôt opened it yet and saw 57.4% and my gut just dropped. Thought I made the worst purchasing decision ever.
Great review! I love store picks of this. Never had this one though, sounds good.
Is this a euro only release? I don‚Äôt recall having seen it before.
Their SiB BP program is amazing.
Nice review! Love a good rye at cask strength!
Are you saying you were worried you bought this bottle? If this was the worst purchasing decision you ever made you'd be doing all right
> I love store picks of this

Me too! I didn't like it quite as much as I had hoped for being their own batched version, but it's every bit as good as most store picks. If you've had some good ones you're not missing out on much here imo
Yeah it's weird right? I never heard of this either. The pic that u/Stefan_1985 sent me of his bottle is 750ml, but maybe he knows more about it
Some sleuthing reveals that it's possibly a ME/VT only release.
One of me favorite things, without a doubt. Thanks for reading!
Yeah. I was worried that the mark you gave it was 57.4% at first scroll.
Good sleuthing, thanks! I might have to peek around for one the next time I‚Äôm up that way.
That would be such an oddly specific score lol. If you're talking about the standard 10 it's delicious stuff, if it's a 10yr single barrel you pry won't find any reviews of it but chances are it's delicious stuff"

**Nose:** Sweet corn and caramel, candy cherry, floral and fruity, clean toasted and caramelized wood, easy spice. Sweet and corny, inoffensive wood, pleasant and agreeable

**Taste:** Big blast of bright sweet corn and spice, cherry, sweet creamy caramel, vanilla, clean and straightforward toasted oak, a little spice heat. It has a sweet and bright caramel cherry feel with lots of Bourbony corn, it's fun and tasty.

**Finish:** Tasty Bourbon spice builds big on the finish but never gets too hot, cherry, creamy vanilla, and sweet caramel woodiness

*****

Bright sweet and pleasant, and the high proof and spice keeps it from being too ""smooth."" It tastes happy. Lots of bright corn and sweet creamy notes. It walks a line of being a little simple, but it stays delicious and fun overall. I've never been a big fan of Maker's Mark, but this is probably the best expression I've had from them and I'm a sucker for a good WHEATER

**Score: 8/10**
This sounds like one of the great WHEATERS. Nice review!
I see you were a big fan! Definitely see this as a sweet and bright bourbon.
RC6 set the bar high for these annual limited releases. Fantastic stuff.
I've been fortunate enough to taste and own many great bourbons and I will say that this is one of my all time favorites.
I remember enjoying this (I don't like Maker's very much) but unfortunately the bottle disappeared during some hefty, not-so-civilized drinking last year.

If you haven't tried it yet I've found this year's SE4xPR5 to be even better. Perhaps not directly comparable but it's a honey graham cracker, caramel, marshmallow sip that is up with 1910 for my favorite dessert pour.

EDIT: Just a little self-note here (since it's 10 AM), I need to blind 1910 vs. SE4...
Great review. I'm a sucker for a good wheater and loved this bottle, too. I'm curious how you have any left??? I drank mine stupidly fast. Haha. Looking forward to this year's release. My only criticism is that it's a little over-priced.
My man! As long as you manage to show up to one of my WHEATER reviews it's all worth it
Sure was. It was almost a 7 for me, it was maybe just a tad boring and simple. But in the end the sweetness won me over, I really like a good wheater profile like this
I'll have to keep an eye out, seems like they aren't too expensive either. Thanks!
Ha, some of us are just really slow drinkers I think. That being said, I don't actually have a bottle of this. It was just a sample I got from a friend.

>My only criticism is that it's a little over-priced.

Wasn't it only $60? That actually seems super reasonable for a barrel proof LE
Yeah, I guess you‚Äôre right. I just picked up the 2020 SE4xPR5 today and it was $65. Looking forward to cracking it!"

*****

**Linkwood 15 G&M, sherry cask, 43%**

**Nose:** Super balanced and pleasant. Rich honey and malt, light pleasant prune & raisin sherry, smooth wood must, easy light caramel, some berry fruits.

**Taste:** Has an oily and thick mouthfeel which is impressive at 43%. Honey, caramel, thick cereal malt, light smooth berry fruits and prune, brighter orange caramel and sweet fruits. It's a very light sherry sweetness that compliments and melds nicely with the thick honey malt. Flavor is balanced and flows very well, yummy

**Finish:** Caramel and malt, light wood must, bright flash of sweet barley malt and fruits. A simple finish but it ends on a pleasant note like the rest of this dram

*****

I'm very impressed with this given the 43%, it easily drinks like a nice thick 46% NCF Scotch. Has an oily and thick mouthfeel with flavors that flow effortlessly, it's pleasant and enjoyable all around. Mostly it's thick honey and malt but with a light balanced sherry. I like it. It feels old school, this would have been just about a perfect Scotch in the old days before we were spoiled by insanely huge cask strength offerings. Fun to sip on and appreciate simpler times.

Great review, agree completely and couldn‚Äôt recommend this one enough! Sherry fruits and caramel galore!
Heard a lot of good things about Linkwood, sounds a bit of a hidden gem.
My only exposure is through JW Green as one of the component malts. Given how much i enjoy that blend I should try and grab a bottle of this
Sounds like an impressive bottle. Always enjoy reading about good Linkwoods. I have a cask strength 12 y.o. Linkwood matured on ex-bourbon which is also carried by honey notes combined with fresh ochard fruits and flowers. Sounds like you got the same signature with some nice sherry influence on the side. Great stuff!
I just grabbed a bottle of this yesterday, excited to taste. Thanks for the review!
Excellent review. It‚Äôs on the list. Another G & M you might enjoy is the Mortlach 15.
Picked up a bottle of this a while back. It was really good out of the gate but the flavor fell off quickly. I‚Äôll finish the bottle soon but it isn‚Äôt as well rounded as it was in the beginning
Great review

I passed on a bottle of the G&M Linkwood 21 in part because of the ABV and in part because of a bad experience with a G&M Mortlach 15.  Sounds like I should reconsider.  I probably wouldn't have blinked if it were 46%.
Glad you enjoyed it!

I love this one just as much - comparing it to a thick 46% NCF is spot on.

Sadly your dram was my last one. Happy it went to a good home!
Indeed
Awesome, enjoy!
I used to see that one around a lot, but I always ignored it due to the low ABV. This one has me wondering now, really impressive for 43%
Don't worry, it will come back! That happened to both of my bottles but I just waited another couple months and they were great again. Strange, but happened to two different bottles purchased a year apart.
Wow, thanks for hooking me up with the last pour. Good stuff
Well, I bought a bottle about 6 years ago. It had good reviews but I didn‚Äôt like it. Just bland. I was in a Binny‚Äôs (rare, right?) earlier this year, it was on sale and I picked one up. It sounds as good as your linkwood with a little savory. The 43% isn‚Äôt a deal breaker. It‚Äôs good."

**Wild Turkey ""Master's Keep"" Bottled in Bond 17 year, 50%**

**Nose:** Very oaky, which should be no surprise. Dry tannic oak, chocolate, caramel, heavy tobacco and wood spice, woody fruits, cherry, toasted oak, vanilla, menthol. Chocolatey and smooth with a nice friendly tannic bite

**Taste:** Dry and oaky, but quite sweet too. Musty, dry tannic wood, sweet woody caramel and butterscotch, vanilla, sweet notes of black cherry and berries come through to brighten it up, menthol spice. It's an experiment in age, lots of dry tannic wood but there's some nice sweet creaminess and fruit notes too. Tasty and balanced, and interesting

**Finish:** The sweeter flavors build into a surprisingly sweet and bright finish. Orange, butterscotch, black cherry, heavy menthol and hot wood spice, plenty of dry tannic oak

*****

I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. It's a fun experiment in old age and heavy dry oak, but presented in a friendly and drinkable way. It's fun and balanced with just enough dry tannic wood to let you know it's age but not be overwhelming. With some air there's some nice sweet and creamy notes that punch through all the oak.

I think it's very sensitive to how your palate is set. Sounds like you got it on a very good night.
I really enjoy this bottle.

Nice review
Great review!  I‚Äôm becoming a big fan of everything WT has been putting out.  Still trying to get my paws on this bottle. I like your review methodology as well. Keep it up.
I've seen mixed reviews on this bottle but I really enjoy it.  I also got the orange notes in this bottle which I haven't had in a wild turkey offering before
How would you compare this to WTMK Decades?
How much did you pay?
Great review my friend! Looking forward to try it too. Have you had wt101/12y, if so how does it compare?
I'm very late to this but I can't find it anywhere.
You had the Cornerstone??
It started off super dry and tannic, but the sweeter notes really opened up with time for me. I take about an hour with a glass usually. I would agree it was a good night though haha
Thanks, and glad you're enjoying it
Thanks for reading! And best of luck finding one. Past releases have always been hot when first released, but tend to cool down and get easier to find with time.
This is much oakier and more interesting. Decades maybe had more corn sweetness, this has more of a fruity cherry sweetness and more oak like I said. Overall I found decades good but kind of boring, I would compare it to a kentucky spirit and I've had RR SiB's that blow it away. This has deeper flavor and is much more interesting
I don't have a bottle, this was a 2oz sample I got from a friend. But I believe this is selling for about $175-$200
They had one in the glass case at a Nh liquor outlets for $149. I went back a few days later to buy it and it was reserved for someone that had just called in.
This is the oakiest wild turkey I think I've had. Older WT like the 12yr usually has more of a chocolatey rich and vanilla oak to me, but this MK is more tannic and dry. Not overwhelmimgly tannic, still very drinkable. Its sweeter too I think
Yeah, I did have Cornerstone. I'm not a big fan of Wild Turkey Rye, but I actually did like that one a lot too. I will say it was the best Rye I ever had from them but I'm just a bigger fan of their Bourbon
mine has been open since the week they released it. the oak has mellowed and it's even more cohesive than it was. super drinkable and a ton of flavor. the oak continues to push the boundaries of being overoaked, but it never does and it keeps me guessing every sip, which I love.  i am sad that I am almost done with my bottle. it keeps changing and getting better.
I have the 13yr and 15yr. Love them both!  Need to nab a 9yr. I also thought I read that a 16yr was to be released.
Thanks for comparison.  I agree that a special RR SiB Pick can be better than either of these WTMK‚Äôs mentioned.  I love Decades (on my 2nd bottle) so it sounds like I‚Äôd really enjoy the different/oak forward shift of WTMK BiB.
Glad to see that you like it. I was on the fence with this one but ended up buying a bottle which I have yet to pick up from my buddy‚Äôs place. What do you think about it value wise?

EDIT: Damn FOMO
Well if you like their bourbon than their rye should be up your alley as I find their rye too be quite bourbon-y ;)
If you have not tried Rare Breed Rye, you should. Very good. Not big on the 101 rye or regular offering rye for reference.
>the oak continues to push the boundaries of being overoaked, but it never does and it keeps me guessing every sip

That's exactly how I feel. It walks a line of tannic heavy oak but doesnt go too far, stays pleasant. Very interesting and enjoyable
Yeah better/worse is obviously gonna be subjective, but this stuff is without a doubt a different oakier profile than decades.
I have a lot of trouble with the cost on these. Cornerstone was the same thing. I figure $120 I would buy no prob, $150 would be a tough sell and probably no-go, but $175-$200 is just right out. I'm a big fan of scotch though, I just think of scotches at a similar price that I would enjoy a lot more
That's sound logic actually haha
That's definitely on my list to try! I'm usually not a fan of barely legal Bourbony Ryes, and kentucky seems to love that style. But I'm always down to give a new barrel proof Rye a chance
Hell yeah, I hope to see it here in Canadia sometime soon!!"

I‚Äôve been drinking scotch for 3 days. Started with Ardbeg 10 year. Freaking love this stuff. I‚Äôve decided that 7-8p every night will be scotch hour. Dim the lights and put on some music that has bagpipes in it. 

Might be going overboard with this. 

In all seriousness, one of the reasons I like it is because it reminds me of Ireland, ie - it tastes like Ireland smells (burning peat). Yes, I realize there is zero connection between scotch and Ireland...other than the whole Northern Ireland issue. 

I‚Äôm hooked
Great review, and a great guess!
I really enjoy the blind tastings too, more than the straight reviews, I think. It's fun (and educational!) to see how good the guesses are. Plus it adds new drams to my shopping list.
Thanks for reading, glad you liked it. It's a really fun way to try stuff, I love doing blind samples
Digging the enthusiasm! It really is some fantastic stuff. Just so you know Ardbeg is from a region called Islay, it's known for being some of the absolute peatiest Scotch there is. Scotch isn't all this smoky

>So is this a new release? Any idea on cost?

No this is from 2015, and these cask strength special releases go for about $150
its a special release after several years.  try the Uigadeal, Corryvrekkan or Little Beast.  all solid drams
Supernova ‚Äò15 is a ‚Ç¨400 bottle these days, if you can find it. If you want to chase the Ardbeg high, stay with the regular releases. The LE‚Äôs sell out quickly, are highly priced and - if I have to be honest - not worth it most of the time. If you want to spend money save them for a early 90s distilled whisky or even a 70s distilled whisky from Ardbeg. 

Also don‚Äôt drink every day, my friend. You get used to a single dram quickly, and then you need two drams a night. Organ damage from alcohol is a real thing and you need less than you think over the years.
Thanks! Yeah, glad I went with my first instinct. Of course once you know it's an Islay it does narrow it down a lot
Yeah I love doing it. You learn something new every time. Especially if you do a blind lineup and rate them. When you don‚Äôt have info beforehand, it‚Äôs amazing what you won‚Äôt know
Thanks for the response! I‚Äôm definitely in Camp Peat, so I reckon I should keep my choices to the Islay region.
Thanks! Are those smoky/peaty?
There was another Supernova released in 2019. It retailed for $180 and was very hard to find. I'm 3/4 of the way through to bottle now, and I don't think it was worth it at $180, and certainly not at the $300 or so you see it at auctions.
yes, all Ardbegs and available. 

Otherwise try some Laphroaigs, my personal favorite distillery.
If you're a peat-lover and already love Ardbeg, I'd say the Uigeadail will probably knock your socks off. Depending on your budget it can be a solid daily sipper, too ‚Äì usually find it in the States between $65-$80. I'd say it's one of the best value Scotches around.
agreed, i got two bottles & am not really excited about opening the 2nd one. the first one was pretty similar to the new port charlotte 10 yr.  

dont get me wrong, ardbeg is my favorite distillery ... but for $180, the SN19 doesnt come close to an octomore.
Ah, gotcha. Thanks for the clarification. My store has lots of different Ardbegs and Laphroaigs so that‚Äôs good! Will keep my occupied for a while."

*****

**Weller Antique 107, Warehouse Liquor single barrel pick, NCF, 53.5%**

**Nose:** Creamy toffee, butterscotch, sticky-sweet caramel orange, tannic musty wood, corn sweetness, savory graham cracker. Delicious woody dessert butterscotch nose

**Taste:** Sweet, friendly, super drinkable. Sweet sugary caramel, vanilla, zippy orange and spice, lightly tannic, creamy toffee, smooth funky wood. Very sweet and slightly creamy feeling, super drinkable and tasty

**Finish:** Cinnamon spice, sweet woody caramel, orange, creamy toffee

*****

This is super tasty and drinkable, no heat or off notes to be found. It's a bit light and simple maybe, but the sweet and creamy flavor is so deliciously on point. It's a shame this stuff can't be more readily available. This is ridiculously good for the $30 price, even if it isn't worth secondary prices imo. Realistically though I would pay $50-$80 for something like this, maybe up to $100 for a barrel this good.

Score: **8**

Nice review, wish I could snag one myself from warehouse liquors one day. The 107 is my guilty pleasure
Where can you buy this for $30? Certainty not at Warehouse liquors.
Great review - sometimes it is the simple things that take the cake...or are the cake...or how ever that saying goes.
No need to feel guilty, it's good stuff
I don't know how much Warehouse Liquors actually charged for this bottle, but roughly $30 was the MSRP for a long time. I think it's gone up higher now but this sample is a few years old. 

It doesn't really matter anyway because this stuff is hard to find unless it's a store gouging at high secondary prices
The point is, I like cake and I like this Bourbon. Thank you, and thanks for reading!
I've bought warehouse Liquor's Weller FP and a 107 pick over the last few years. Several years ago they had a 107 that was phenomenal.  

I think anymore their 107 picks are coming in around $60. 

I really enjoyed your review.  Too many people piss on l07 for a variety of reasons(some legitimate some not so much), with the increase in price as one and the lack of access at msrp the other. 

I like Weller 107 and with a decent amount of store picks available it is a sure fire go to pour even at current prices.
Cost on OWA bottles is 50 bucks now, but commonly I see store picks for 60ish. Secondary of course is another story. I wish it was easier to find here, because OWA is one of my favorites.
$60 might be closer to MSRP now, I know the whole Weller line got bumped up in price. And yeah I like the standard 107 too but unfortunately it's just not something I'm able to get which sucks."

**Port Charlotte 6 2011 Micro-Provenance #1860, 1st fill Bourbon, 61.4% (done blind)**

**Nose:** Heavy medicinal peat and thick vanilla, huge and lumbering heavy peat it‚Äôs beautiful, chocolate, vanilla icing, sweet caramel, clean ashy char, some lemon citrus and tart berry, classic bourbon barrel peat notes that are on the sweet side. It really smells like a bourbon barrel Laphroaig, just beautiful

**Taste:** Huge peat that pops, it‚Äôs soft and clean yet huge and just keeps building, smooth wood, huge thick vanilla, cake frosting, root beer char, sweet gritty caramel wood notes. Has a bright sweet woodiness, it glistens and explodes with huge Islay peat. Still feeling Laphroaig on this one

**Finish:** Sweet sweet wood notes, caramel, big sweet vanilla icing, root beer char, big chocolatey peat and some briny sea. Long sweet and peaty finish

* Beautiful peat monster. It‚Äôs a huge and thick peat but it‚Äôs not mean or boggy, it‚Äôs soft and lumbering and sweet. Incredibly thick and balanced. The medicinal quality and thick vanilla really feels like a Bourbon barrel Laphroaig to me, and it‚Äôs a bright sweet one. I think it‚Äôs in that sweet spot of about 10-12 years, not super young and solidly 50-55%ish. It‚Äôs balanced enough to be an OB cask strength release too, but it‚Äôs a little better than I remember any of them being. So Laphroaig 10CS will be my guess, maybe some crazy good older batch

Score: **9/10**

*****

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** Nice! I often have trouble committing on a mystery sample, but I was so sure this was a Laphroaig! So much vanilla, just felt like a Laphroaig. The age really blows me away. I love young peat, but this just felt older to me. So balanced and thick, awesome sweet wood notes. And 61%, it drank so smooth. I was wrong about everything lol. But what a killer Islay and pleasure to drink, thank you

I‚Äôm a big fan of Bruichladdich distillery, and this is easily the best Port Charlotte I‚Äôve ever had. They always have crazy wine finishes, this might be the first proper Bourbon barrel PC I‚Äôve had and it‚Äôs amazing

This sounds like an awesome dram to review blind! Have yet to read a disappointing review about a young Islay in good quality bourbon barrels. Going to look out for bottles with these specs.
There‚Äôs a lot of huge thick smooth wood glistening and exploding here.
I‚Äôm a huge fan of Bruichladdich‚Äôs Port Charlotte series. Their entry level Port Charlotte is a staple in my home. At the $60 range, it really punches above its weight with a soft, smooth, yet ever present peat flavor and a candied fruit sweetness that‚Äôs reminiscent of classic Speyside malts and rather unique to find in an Islay Scotch. Hands down one of my all time favorites.
It's the silver lining in the modern trend of younger Whisky and NAS Scotch: Islay and peated Scotch can be fucking awesome at a young age
OK settle down lol
Yeah PC is great, I get all kinds of tropical fruits with the heavy Islay peat. It's unique and delicious stuff"

**Aultmore 8yr 2011, Single Cask Nation, 1st fill Bourbon 60.7% (done blind)**

**Nose:** Bright, lemon citrus, happy sweet malt, salted caramel, funky banana, buttery, sweet floral honey, brine. It‚Äôs happy and bright and malty but there‚Äôs a strong funky note like popcorn butter and banana bread, maybe a little tar and brine. It‚Äôs funky in a good way

**Taste:** Bright, zingy and malty. Bright sweet caramel and lemon citrus, thick happy pastry malt, big spice zing, banana, brine and salted caramel, really nice honey and floral notes but it stays thick overall. The funk from the nose isn‚Äôt as strong, it just has a strong funky banana malt vibe. Bright and hot and malty. It‚Äôs a bit too hot, so I added water which I don‚Äôt normally do and it helped even it out a lot

**Finish:** Spice heat that dissipates into rich floral honey, beautifully drawn out sweet thick maltiness and banana

* I was ready to score this lower because it is just so hot, the spice was a little overwhelming. But adding some water did wonders. It balanced everything out and let the thick funky malt shine through. It has an interesting funk to it that is really good, usually I would say maybe slightly peated or some zany barrel shenanigans but I think it is just a characterful and funky distillate. At first I was thinking Kilkerran, but it reminds me more of some funky and malty Speyside/Highland stuff I‚Äôve had like Auchentoshan or Dailuaine. Really interesting and delicious stuff, a lot of crazy flavors that come together really nicely. I‚Äôm thinking refill barrell, 10-12 years, and a hot 55-60% ABV.

Score: **8/10**

*****

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** Nice, never had any Aultmore! Young first fill makes sense, I didn‚Äôt think it was very old but I wouldn‚Äôt have thought quite that young. What a distinctive and unique malt that stuff has, the funk was so tasty. EDIT: I was cooking at the time I drank this, I'm thinking that might be where a lot of the funk on the nose may have come from. I drank the last wee bit the next day and it didn't seem as funky, fwiw.

Hot damn man, that sounds pretty good. Sometimes a little water really does the trick. Looks like I just found my next bottle to pick up!
You always say that lol. If it's not too pricey I recommend it. I still really want that Ben Nevis 23 SCN myself
Yea, I know but it sounds really good and it only $90, so, it‚Äôs on the list. I‚Äôm curious here, do others keep a ‚Äúto buy list?‚Äù I keep one and keep adding and subtracting from it. If I add it to the list and after my initial infatuation with it continues for a couple of weeks or more, I buy it. If not, and I think, naw, it‚Äôs not for me, then I remove it and move on. Not to hijack your post but just wondering what others do.
Just picked one up. Can‚Äôt wait to try it.
I've constantly got a ""want to buy"" list going that's a mile long haha. It's all in my head, but I guess it works the same way. If I forget about it then I can live without it, but some just keep nagging at me and work their way to the top of that list-such as that Ben Nevis
Right on dude, looking forward to the review! I don't think I told you but I got that Glencoe 8 blended malt from Ben Nevis. Haven't opened it yet
I think I could buy a pretty decent used car with the amount of money it would take to clear up my 'want to buy' list
Had to go get one. I‚Äôm really becoming a big fan of SCN. That‚Äôs cool you got that Ben Nevis. Looking forward to your take on it.
Hah, now that would be a waste of money üòâ
I know, and meanwhile I'm still eyeballing that goddamn Ben Nevis 23 haha. Have you heard of this one?

https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/135518/islay-2008-jwc

Just says it's an ""undisclosed Diageo owned distillery."" I can get it for $120. Diageo owned would be Caol Ila or Lagavulin. Laga would be cool obviously but is unlikely, and $120 seems steep for a Caol Ila
That BN is pretty good but choices have to be made. Haven‚Äôt heard anything about that one. It is a SCN though even if it is a Caol Ila. Could be really good. Here‚Äôs one for you, https://www.binnys.com/single-cask-nation-glenburgie-20-year-old-cask-strewngth-single-malt-from-refill-ex-bourbon-hogshead-751405-980189.html  
Have you heard anything about this one?
No, but I can get that one too I think. Choices choices indeed. And now I have Mezcal and Armagnac in the mix, so it's even worse. It's a problem I love having!
Hah, yea, you do have your hands full! Good problems to have. How‚Äôs that smoke out there? Are you guys ok?
It's been smoky for weeks or months now, I've lost count. Smokiest year I can remember. Makes for some very eerie and apocalyptic yet strangely beatiful sunsets/sunrises. 

Actually a decent sized wildfire flared up yesterday pretty close to my house, less than a mile away. It was scary af. Our Firefighting forces are badass, they threw everything at it because Cali sure doesn't need more fire. In no time there was a fire spotting plane, 3 water dumping helicopters, a huge retardant dropping plane, and a shitload of groundcrew. They had it out within a few hours, I think I heard that it burned about 65 acres. Luckily the wind was moving the fire away from me so I wasn't really in danger but it's scary seeing that huge plume of black smoke so close. It was over by my dads house tho so I was ready to run over there and help him if he needed me.

As scary as it was it's also really fucking cool watching 5 different aircraft coordinating with each other while tons of trucks and sirens kept whizzing by. Anyway that's my dramatic story ha
A day in the life of California, holy fuck. The fires and smoke look insane. I‚Äôll take our rare tornados üå™ or polar vortex‚Äôs any day. 

I think the most interesting weather place is the Colorado front range. They get fires, they get smoke and ash, they get severe weather, intense heat and cold. It‚Äôs where weather systems are born and like both of us, legal weed.

All said, the duration of the fires in California, especially this year, are the worse. They just don‚Äôt seem to quit. Stay safe.
I was gonna ask you what your guy's severe weather is like out there, tornadoes can be pretty terrifying from what I hear too"

**Glendronach 27yr 1992, Glendronach Appreciation Society, PX Puncheon, 54.5% (done blind)**

**Nose:** Sweet, and the color is dark. Dark cherry and raisin, toffee, sweet plum, thick malt, chocolate, dark charred and toasted wood, big warm vanilla, extremely mellow spice. It‚Äôs a rich dark sweetness

**Taste:** Warm, huge, smooth sweet fruits. Incredibly thick and viscous, just saturated with fruits. Thick syrupy cherry, grape, rich dark fruits, all builds bigly. Toffee, rich maltiness, smooth caramel wood, effortless mellow spice tingle. Viscous fruity sweetness that is smooth and warm, with a gentle tartness. Very friendly and drinkable.

**Finish:** Brighter tart cherry and strawberry, vanilla, sweet candy fruit, some wood funk. A really nice sweet and bright yet mellow finish

* Pretty sure this is a Scotch with heavy sherry influence, which makes it pretty hard to narrow down. ABV is hard to nail down too, it‚Äôs super drinkable yet very full flavored, so I‚Äôm going to say low 50‚Äôs%. Reminds me of some sherried Japanese Whisky like Ohishi with that saturated and smooth feel it has, but I don‚Äôt know of any of those that are cask strength. A delicious fruit bomb whatever it is

Score: **8/10**

*****

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** Another zinger, thank you much! I almost scored this one a 9. It was super drinkable and smooth, just completely saturated and wonderful. I love that it‚Äôs PX, explains the candy-like sweetness. I considered guessing Glendro but it didn‚Äôt taste like any of the the Oloroso casks I‚Äôve had before. Really thought the ABV was lower, so drinkable.

Man, I would love to try this...
Love being part of the GAS. Props on getting your hands on a sample!
I have way too high expectations for this bottle and I plan to keep putting off opening it until I work through that :-)
Nice review! My bottle is still sitting safely sealed. 92 is my birth year, so I'm opening it with friends on a special birthday
Where'd you pick it up?
Good review! Damn idk what influence you have to get bad ass mystery scotch to taste and review but that pretty cool. If this is an 8 out of 10 for you, what would you consider a 10? Not that I‚Äôd probably ever be able to drink it lol
ngl it's pretty darn good
Thanks, I feel pretty lucky!
I think it will deliver. It's the best Glendronach single cask I've ever had, awesome you snagged a bottle
You could make an ordinary birthday special with this bottle
I just got to try a sample of it, I'm not sure how people buy a ""Glendronach Appreciation Society"" bottle like this.
Thanks! I'm nothing special honestly, I just have some good friends that let me try some killer stuff sometimes. 

>If this is an 8 out of 10 for you, what would you consider a 10?

Take my scoring with a grain of salt, it's always the most difficult part for me. Especially blind. And tbh I'm not the biggest fan of sherry and Glendronach single barrels, I tend to like them a little punchier. But ""punchy"" isn't what you look for in a 27 year Scotch, so judging it for what it is it's a beautifully aged Scotch and it's easily a 9 or 10. Most of my 9's and 10's are peated and malty Scotches, just personal preference.

Good friends and good whisky can‚Äôt be beat. 

Yeah I‚Äôve been drinking whisky for 7 years now and I still can‚Äôt get into heavy peated scotch. I bought a bottle of Lagavulin 16 and gave it away 3/4 full. Maybe it was a bad bottle but haven‚Äôt desired to try anything smokey after that"

* Smooth and balanced feel with a nice chocolatey richness and light to medium smoke, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like an Islay. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cask strength, but it feels like it‚Äôs in the respectable 46% range. At first it reminded me of a lightly smoked or funky Glen Scotia/Campbeltown, but the more it calmed down the more it reminded me of Talisker 10 with all the smooth rich barrel notes. So I guess that will be my guess!

The US Edition was at 43% and I really liked it.
It really shows when older bottling at low abv's still have great mouthfeel and fullness of flavour. VERY hard to find that nowadays. Mind you, we're spoiled with all the CS and high abv goodness.

Sidenote: I'm pretty sure one of these sold for 1.5K+ semi recently in my area.
How interesting. Uve seen other scotches that bottle at a higher ABV in the U.S., why do they do that?
Totally agree, it says a lot about the quality of this stuff that it can be so rich and full at 40%. It just makes it that much more tragic it wasn't given a proper strength tho. My impression is that there is much more cask strength and NCF/46% stuff going around these days, so I'm glad about that.
Oops. I just double checked the bottle and this one is 43%. I must have pulled the wrong one from Whiskybase, my bad.
I think back then, importers had much more opportunity to request things like that.
The cask quality was better and I think there was less chill filtering and coloring added. Back then whisky was less popular, they had to make quality stuff. Right now we are living in a whisky boom for every kind of whisky. Demand goes up quality goes down.
I feel a little better about my 46% guess now, still drank impressive. Thanks for letting me know
Just got word that this was actually 43% and not 40%, little mixup. But I have seen stuff today bottled at different strength for different markets. Pretty sure laphroaig 10 is 40% in the UK but 43% here in the US"

An excellent review. I just compared my review with yours - very similar. This is just a stellar bottle. SCN has been putting out some really nice stuff.
Nice blind review. You know, I‚Äôve never seen a Single Cask Nation bottle in the wild. Where do folks find these?
paging u/borntoannoyAWildJowi , you might be interested in this review.
Agreed, SCN bottlings are always so impressive. It's always fun when you can confirm it with a blind review like this too, removes all bias
If you think about it, there's actually not a whole lot out there. They are all single casks, so this for instance only had 209 bottles, a sherry butt might be more like 400 bottles. And they only release about 5-10 bottles at a time. Worldwide, that's not very much. So I'm surprised we see it talked about s often as we do. A few key places such as California might just get the bulk of it
Fore me, it's Binny's, Dapper-Dram. They get a lot of them. Where are you located?
To horn in on this conversation, I‚Äôve seen a few SCN bottlings at exactly one shop in Maryland, but the pricing has kept me from buying any. So they must have at least some distribution on the east coast.
Hah, that's what I told him, too!
Thanks! I saw it, haha. Looks delicious, but I just found out that the store I thought had it actually sold out of it :(. They said they might be able to order it, but I‚Äôm waiting to hear back.
Yup, it's a good one.
When I pour a Ben Nevis I expect to find doughy, yeasty, fruity, strawberries. So a blind review does remove those basic biases ( until I taste the Ben Nevis and then, ah, doughy, yeasty, fruity, strawberries! I'm gonna have to try some blind tasting though.
I had no idea they were that rare*!
NYC
> the store I thought had it actually sold out of it :(

Oh, sorry about that. Such is often the way with IB bottles, but the good news is that there are always new ones being created.

This of course means that the answer to your question posed in that other thread is: *don't buy the $200 bottle, nope, nope, nope - not a good idea. Oh wait, you mean they* **do** *have it in stock - hmmm let me rephrase that - get it, get it, get it!*

Cheers!
I picked up their Port Dundas 42.  95 bottles (but 51.7%!).  Greedy angels! 

But I also found the Clynelish 23 and that produced a bit over 500 bottles of 52.4% deliciousness.  So they vary quite a bit depending on cask type.

They also have the Stones of Stennes 18 and the Glenburgie on the shelf from release #5.

Another shop in the area had the Clynelish 9, which was standard profile Clynelish.

We don't generally have alot of SCN around me in CO, but I found a shop that caries all they can get their hands on from the state's distributor.  They had the Ledaig 13 and the Imperial 23 but both sold out. Everything is slow to show up here.  I think the Ben Nevis from release 6 should show up in the next couple months.  The owner mentioned release 6 just showed up for him to order.

The pricing might be what is keeping them from getting picked up more widely.  They aren't typically a bad value and I've thought alot of IB bottles have been really high lately.  The Stones of Stennes (HP) 18 was nearly as much as the OB single casks and it was a refill bourbon barrel (not hogshead) while the younger OB single casks I picked up were first fill or 2nd fill European oak sherry butts.  

The younger SCN releases like the Clynelish 9 have been more accessible in the $99-$130 range, but then sometimes have odd age statements.
NJ liquor stores are usually your best bet. We see them occasionally out here on Long Island too.  I can DM you with some stores that routinely carry their stuff, if you are interested.
Yup, just hoping to find something else interesting now! Cheers!
Good news! I just found a Blackadder raw cask Ben Nevis 15yr! Review coming soon ;)
I am interested! Yes thank you.

"Review #174: Arran 18 1996 Blackadder Raw Cask, 52.6%",,https://i.redd.it/gkxnfvpidvh51.jpg,"Courtesy of u/theslicknick6

*****

**Lochranza(Arran)18 1996, Blackadder Raw Cask, refill Sherry Butt, 52.6%**

**Nose:** Delicate and floral, rich honey with delicious complex flowery notes, mild fruit funk, sweet barley sugar, gentle peppery spice. 

**Taste:** Beautiful oily thick mouthfeel but with delicate & balanced flavor. Sweet barley, smooth malt, rich honey, smooth gentle fruits, big complex floral notes and vanilla, builds bright with lemon citrus, bright sweet malt and pastry

**Finish:** Sweet malt and honey, lemon, vanilla, floral sweetness. Ends with big bright malty sweetness

*****

An excellent Scotch, I would not have guessed sherry was involved here. It's malty and incredibly balanced, wood overall is very minimal but it still has plenty of thick oily richness. Not spirity or sharp in the slightest. Sherry might have added some fruity undercurrent but I might just be looking for it. Extremely delicate at first, takes a lot of time to open up but rewarding once it does.

Another great review. I‚Äôve looked at this one for a handful of years and now I‚Äôll have to pick it up. It sounds really good.
Where have you seen this? Depending on price I might skip it, these Raw casks can be super expensive
I absolutely loved my Raw Cask. I wood(Oak lol) 100% recommend and encourage trying. 
I was blown away by the quality.
I bought just for the 'Raw Cask', thinking even if I don't like the flavor it will still be an incredible experience. Turns out the flavor was brilliant and the quality was impeccable.

"Review #171: Wild Turkey Master's Keep ""Decades,"" 52%",,https://i.redd.it/m6u88x7pbfh51.jpg,"It's been about a year since I have had this, and that's where I would put it.  It's really good, but I have had RR SiB's that beat it.  However, these are a perfect splurge for yourself or as a gift for someone who likes Bourbon and WT, and is pretty accessible to all thanks to the proof.
Agree with your review. I find that I reach for my RRSiBs more than this. Some days, I think it is good (although still not worth the price of admission); while on other days, I simply think it is an average release, at best. Factoring price into the equation, I definitely regret my purchase given I could've had at least 2 very good RRSiBs instead. My reason for staying away from all the recent LEs.
This was released in 2017 to celebrate Eddie Russell's 35th year at Wild Turkey. It's a blend of Bourbons 10-20 years old. Sample courtesy of u/Ethanized, and I believe it's actually the oldest sample in my collection from early 2018

*****

**Wild Turkey Master's Keep ""Decades,"" 52%**

**Nose:** Nice musty wood, vanilla, cinnamon spice, hot cherry, some brash grainy corn. A little more brash and spicey than I would have guessed, it's really nice

**Taste:** Mellow and even-keeled but still has some nice Bourbon kick, makes for a tasty balance. Mellow caramel-toasted oak, sweet wood spice, vanilla, mildly brash sweet corn and hot cherry kick, smooth orange. It's very Bourbony, it's tasty but doesn't have a lot of personality or ""wow"" factor to me. 

**Finish:** Some spice follows thru on the finish, orange caramel and mellow musty wood, sweet Bourbon. Not a spectacular finish but sweet and tasty with just the right amount of mellow spice kick

*****

This is really good, but as a big fan of Wild Turkey(duh) I was maybe hoping for a little more. It could pass for a really smooth Kentucky Spirit, and I've had Russell's Reserve single barrels that blow this away. Nothing really jumps out as being spectacular or extraordinary here. I'm only nitpicking because of it's price and special release status though, it's still a delicious Bourbon and a pleasure to sip on.

I agree with a lot of your review. I reviewed it myself a couple weeks backs. Have been drinking it here and there since. Also was able to SBS it with MK BIB17 recently. 

I think it has a better finish and mouthfeel than any RR pick I have ever had and I think it‚Äôs a bit more complex overall. Has that musty smoky note (I‚Äôve not gotten that on a RR sib) that I can only assume comes from those 20 year barrels. It‚Äôs very well rounded. Still hard to justify the $200 I dropped. 

For those keeping score - me and two buds all chose  the MK BIB 17 year in a semi-blind SBS.

Thanks for the review!!
I bought this, saving it for a special occasion to reward myself, because in the reddit dataset it actually comes out in the top10 of all bourbons

More recent reviews have been more lackluster, I wonder if bourbon got a lot better in the last 3years haha

Still excited to open it though
What are the top 10? And where can I see that list?
> in the reddit dataset it actually comes out in the top10 of all bourbons

Oh wow, I had no idea. Everyone's tastes are different, and it's a fine Bourbon anyway. I'm sure you'll enjoy it if you like Wild Turkey

"Beautiful bottle, but the level inside is always a mystery. Turns out this was the last pour",,https://i.redd.it/vvuyw4rrwvg51.jpg,"Same with black arts. I have a running tally of how much I‚Äôve taken out
Is the bottom opaque as well?
i have a untasted 8.1 and am thinking of opening.

what are your impressions of the whisky?
Have a digital scale?

Pour spirit into a vessel. Place on scale. Change to kg setting. Zero out the scale. Find weight of empty bottle. Funnel spirit into bottle. Get total weight. Divide difference by 1.75. Now you know how many ""shots"" are in the bottle.
Yeah I wish they'd put a small window so you at least had an idea about the level
Fine whisky there. 
Holding the bottle up Infront of a light works for me, to see the level.
Yeah, I sometimes use a long cooking chopstick as a dipstick.
You could use a router to make a vertical slit in the bottle, so you can see the fill level. 

But what I always do is stop a weight in the bottle, then time the time or takes before I hear it hitting the whisky. Then some complicated math and voila, x drams left! Works every time
Yeah completely black top to bottom
It's amazing. Octomore is consistently some of my favorite scotch, and the 8.1 is a great one. Insanely huge peat of course but so much more than that, an amazing thick mouthfeel, crazy long finish, and this is a very sweet and malty one too. It's like a dessert octomore
Man that reeks of effort
Added bonus, extra wood aging!
I just take it as part of the octomore experience. It's kind of fun because you never worry about the fill level, and you skip the whole ""uh oh, bottle is getting low"" moment. Just pure enjoyment from every pour until it's gone
with a flutter of cashew chicken!
Yeah, although it's pretty risky pouring this for friends and not having enough to go around
Just part of the .1, .2, and .4 experience. ;)"
"Review #173: Balblair 13 Oloroso single barrel K&L pick, 56.2%",,https://i.redd.it/44uhpdu632g51.jpg,"Courtesy of u/Dyllix

*****

**Balblair 13 single barrel, K&L pick, oloroso, 56.2%**

**Nose:** Sweet candy rasberry and strawberry, raisin, toffee, sweet wine, light sulfur, vanilla, creamy malt, milk chocolate. Light pleasant dessert-sweet sherry and nice creamy malt, 

**Taste:** Thick and malty with big warm balanced sherry. Fruity sherry, light raisin and prune, sweet strawberry, caramel, thick fruity malt, sweet funky sherry, toffee, orange, milk chocolate, mildly hot wood. Feels creamy and balanced, not an in-your-face sherry bomb at all. More of a sweet fruity balanced sherry. Super drinkable

**Finish:** Darker fruits, plum and raisin, warm tingly spice builds, chocolatey wood with mild char

*****

A fantastic Scotch. Surprisingly, after 13 years in an Oloroso cask it's not really a sherry bomb. It's a big warm and sweet sherry that is very well balanced with the rich Balblair malt. Creamy sweet and very drinkable. I would have probably guessed it was just a sherry finish, which works great for me because I often prefer a lighter sherry influence. Between this and the Munros Glen Grant 22 I had yesterday that's a couple of home runs from K&L

Man, now you have me wanting to buy this Balblair and the Munros Glen Grant 22. I just ordered three Arrans (Machrie Moor, Bothy, Master of Distilling 2) from KL and was considering getting a Bourbon cask Kavalan from total wine but may reconsider that bottle in favor of the Balblair/Glen Grant. Decisions, decisions! Thanks for the reviews!
Sounds good. I need to open up my sample.
I wish K&L would ship out of state. Not only do they have great in-house write-ups (not just ""this is so good"" but actually why they picked it)... But they have a killer selection of cask strength IBs at a variety of price points.  


The only places near me that have IBs are the exact opposite: no on at the store has tried them, they are all proofed down, no cask info, and heavily picked over - everything is either off the wall distilleries you've never tastes anything from (not necessarily a bad thing but not if no one can tell you anything about the bottle) or blue chips that are overpriced based on the fact that they've been on the shelf for years. I'm not paying $229 for a 20yr 46% Clynelish with no cask info. Doesn't look like anyone else is since the bottle is dusty and was dumped 12yrs ago. 



I should just bite the bullet and order a mixed box of cask strength IBs from the UK.
Never a shortage of options out there lol
If it makes you feel any better, they tend to overhype their stuff a lot. I've had lots of duds from K&L that sound like the best thing you'll ever have from their write-up. I rarely buy anything from them anymore unless I can try it first or see a reliable review. But yeah this one is a winner so I see your point.

You should try FineDrams if you're interested in ordering from overseas. They will ship stuff anywhere and it's relatively cheap shipping, they have a great selection, and their customer service is fantastic if there's any problems. I've used them several times. Just be aware that international shipping can take a long time right now whoever you use, customs and shipping services are overwhelmed since the start of covid.
I finally made my decision and ordered both the Balblair and the Glen Grant 22. It‚Äôs for science, right?

Unfortunately now the Single Cask Nation Ben Nevis 23 is in the running thanks to your other review.
Will second this.  When David Driscoll was there at K&L, he had a way of hinting in his writing at the really good stuff while maintaining a positive tone about the ""regular"" offerings.   Now that he's gone and after being burned by some of their write ups, I've been extra cautious.   This one sounds fantastic though.  u/buckydean: Thanks for the great review.  Was this cask # 76?
Thanks for reading, hope you found it helpful! I've heard other similar complaints about K&L after Dave left, I never really followed quite closely enough to notice this. Thanks for the input

>Was this cask # 76?

Yes this is the one currently on sale. It's only the 2nd Balblair single barrel I know of from them, and the only sherried one. The other was a Bourbon barrel last year, I didn't like it nearly as much as this one"

*****

**Lous Mouracs 1979 39yr Armagnac Tenareze, L'Encantada, 50.1%**

**Nose:** Despite the insanely dark color, it's a familiar kind of fruity Armagnac nose-only way more so. Heavy & thick dark cherry cola, a warm blanket of heavy tart grape fruitiness, chocolate cherry, brooding wood spice, smooth & heavy tannic oak

**Taste:** Dark, brooding, intense. Concentrated dark cherry cola and tart grape, syrupy and dark, bitter chocolate, thick toasted and charred tannic wood, burnt grape, a big tannic and tart burst, tobacco, smooth layer of wood spice. It's just as much of a tart bomb as it is an oak bomb. 

**Finish:** Brightens up somewhat with tart cherry and grape sweetness, vanilla, dark toasted sweet oak and thick mellow spice

*****

Well this was an experience. It reminds me of an Armagnac version of ECBP(the old original bottlings): thick and dark and intense, lots of concentrated dark cherry cola and wood. But it is still has a fierce tart grape fruitiness, the wood as strong as it is hasn't taken over. It's pretty intense and oaky, it's something I would need to be in the mood for but it's amazing and would hit the spot like nothing else I've ever had. Also, I gotta say this has got to be the darkest spirit I've ever poured.

Holy shit, looks like prune juice! Sounds so good. I‚Äôve got to start looking into Armagnac. So, is the Armagnac rabbit hole as deep as the scotch one?
Great notes, glad you enjoyed it! And yeah this is the darkest naturally colored spirit I‚Äôve encountered.
Yum
Wow, great review. I'll keep an eye out for this one.
>is the Armagnac rabbit hole as deep as the scotch one?

Money-wise, yes. But they are produced in small quantities and not shipped out of France as much I think, so it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of it to hunt down. They tend to be a little pricey once you find them tho. Still a good deal compared to Scotch. You can get 20-30 year bottles in the $100-$200 range, and it's not uncommon to see them at the 30-40 year range. This 39 year I reviewed went for $200 I believe at a store in Texas. From what I hear demand and prices are already up a lot from where they were a few years ago, thanks to people like me just getting into it I suppose.
Thanks. I think it sold out at the store it's from a while ago
Ok, sounds good. Those are the prices I‚Äôm seeing around here, too. $200 for that one sounds like an incredible bargain, especially considering what a single malt like that would cost. Sounds like I should jump in while availability and price are still good. I remember 10 years ago how the availability and prices were for single malt.
Well then I won't!
That mentality is how the rabbit hole is haha. You feel like geez I should jump on it now before this stuff blows up. I know it only speeds up process tho. 

I dont think this is one you should jump on tho. It's pretty strong and oaky, it's a bit much. I have a chance to get it for $230+shipping and I think I'm gonna pass
I‚Äôll start with one from Binny‚Äôs and around $100 or so. Dip my toe in and see what I think. I‚Äôm not worried about missing out. The only thing I wished I had done was stocked up on that older  Macallan CS when it around $50 a bottle. Ah well, could have, should have. There‚Äôs plenty of very drinkable stuff out there. Your last 2 K & L reviews, Glen Grant and Balblair really sound good. Cheers, oh, a bunch of Binny‚Äôs  were looted again last night. Very sad.
Shit, that's still going on? Yeah that sucks, fuck looters
Yeah there's tons of stuff I think back on that I could have stocked up on. No use lamenting it, still plenty of great stuff available for sure. I would have missed out on other good bottles at the time anyway if all my funds were just going towards stocking up
Yea, no protesters, just organized looters. Late last night into the morning. I know it‚Äôs selfish but I feel bad for all that nice scotch. I‚Äôve seen photos of broken bottles - dumb fucks. In reality, all the personal property stolen and buildings busted up. This is not good."

**Taste:** Creamy and thick, really nice mouthfeel that is so balanced yet still big and flavorful. light chocolate, caramel, thick fruity malt, smooth wood, vanilla, brown sugar, creamy dessert pastry. Creamy and malty with just the right amount of smooth wood notes, beautiful

**Finish:** Sweet caramel malt, smooth wood, dessert pastry, smooth chocolatey wood and malt. Long sweet malty finish

*****

Smooth and balanced in the best possible way with sweet fruity malt and smooth wood notes, has a creamy and friendly mouthfeel with lots of big pleasant flavor. The wood notes are extremely well balanced, adding a touch of sweet woody richness that really compliments the big creamy and fruity malt. I really dug this.

Thanks for the review, this sounds heavenly. The Munros are one of those IBs with so little presence online-- I think it's hard for the general consumer to take a punt without tasting because of that, but it also means they fly under the radar. I bought the Ledaig 20 as a thank-you gift for a friend, and we enjoyed it immensely.
Thank you for posting this! I‚Äôm always staring at these IB at K&L and can never decide to try them.
Another great review. I‚Äôve heard really good things about older Glen Grants. This one simply sounds amazing.
So I‚Äôve read your comments below about K&L picks being hit or miss. I agree that it is so helpful to find a review or two before picking up  stray bottle or two. That said, sometimes you just have to jump right in.
Thank you for posting the review. This bottle caught my eye on the website but was hesitant to try it out blindly. IB Glen Grants can be really good, but my recent purchases have fell sort of flat. This definitely sounds like a keeper.
Nice review! Seriously considering buying this one now
Sure thing, thanks for reading! I've never heard of Munros before outside of these K&L bottlings, but I like this. And I've heard that Ledaig was awesome
Sure thing! K&L picks can be hit or miss, there's great ones like this but there's lots of meh ones. I've stopped buying them for the most part unless I can try it first or see a good review. So I try to post it if I get a chance to try one
Yeah you don't always have the chance for these limited picks to try or read reviews. K&L has 4 of these Munros bottles but this is the only one I was able to try. Glad it was a good one at least!

I know you tend to jump in to those Binny picks a lot haha

It's just vaguely sweet and malty and...Scotchy. It has a ""sameness"" that I find similar with lots of youngish malty IB Highland/Speyside Scotch. It's enjoyable to sip on but doesn't wow or impress very much. I've actually been using this to mix into other stuff and It works well to take the edge off of stuff that is maybe too young, or too sulfury, or too hot, or too whatever.

Whisky Galore seemed to be the line for Duncan Taylor‚Äôs casks that weren‚Äôt going to wow anyone (with a few exceptions). Most of the ones I‚Äôve had were somewhere between just OK and outright weird.
Ouch. 11 year old, 1992 bourbon cask aged Clynelish, this should have been pretty good. Worn out cask do you suppose?
Huh this is the only one I've had. I can see that tho, this wasn't very memorable. Seems like a silly gimmicky concept too
Hard to say. It had decent color and wasn't totally spirity like it was a worn out refill. I think maybe it just suffered from the ABV, might have been better at cask strength
The only WG I've had is a Bruichladdich 12 from 1991 or 92.  It was cheap for an IB at 46%.  I bought it because I was interested in how the pre-94 spirit was without alot of age or cask management on it.  The answer - just like the modern spirit.
I suppose. I recently had a signatory 22 year old Benrinnes, CS, bourbon cask aged, that too, was just flat and worn out tasting. Well, just a reminder that ‚Äúnot all wizards are good, Harry‚Äù. Sometimes a batch is just off?"

This is on a whole other level compared to Jack Daniels other products. This isn't just ""decent for a JD"" it's straight up delicious. It has that hot and lively woody feel like a newer ECBP but more maple and sweet char, and not quite as ""big."" It's definitely hot but it's a fun lively spice that adds to the experience, not just a brash unbalanced alcohol burn. A great Bourbon from beginning to end and a pleasure to sip on.

great review!! I‚Äôve wanted to try these for a long time but i‚Äôm always afraid they‚Äôll end up being a banana-bomb. I think you‚Äôve persuaded me to go for it, though!
I bought one bottle and had two pours of it and went back to the store the next day and grabbed two more. Mine is 65.2% / 130.4 proof L-18 Rick N9, and let me tell you it is incredible. My favorite bottle of bourbon to this date is ECBP C919 but this one can play in the same league. Great depth of flavors and I get some balanced banana bread along with vanilla and brown sugar. A splash of water tames the heat but the flavors still come through. I don‚Äôt know another better bottle at $55
This stuff is amazing - get it while you can.
Haven't seen this particular one around. What's the difference between this and the JD Single Barrel Barrel Proof with the black label?
I bought a bottle of this last week and agree that it‚Äôs excellent.
Jack Daniels is not bourbon...
Is there a chance rudolph could chime in on the rick house? I‚Äôve been trying to learn about each.
Ha I just had this discussoin with someone else. I don't get any banana here, but I've never really picked up banana notes in a Bourbon honestly.
After seeing many positive reviews here, I took the plunge last night when I came across a bottle in stock. Tasted side by side with OF 1920 and it held its own.  In fact, I'd say it's not far off from 1910, if that had the extra heat that 1920 brings. Lots of different flavors coming at you, very enjoyable.
Closest I've gotten to banana-bomb is more of a bananas foster note in a JDSBBP.
Some barrels have banana similar to a woodford or old forester, but occasionally you may get a barrel that‚Äôs banana forward (in the lower proofs in my experience e.g. 63%). I believe the banana reduces with age which should be correlated with angel‚Äôs share and higher proof. Try to find a barrel that‚Äôs 65%+ ABV.
By all means, do try it for yourself but...

I really like dusty JD and JD Single Barrels. I even like JD Heritage Barrel as a change of pace. Some of the reviewers (on youtube and otherwise) really love this stuff. I wish that I could say that I was one of them. Alas, I bought a half bottle a couple of weeks ago and shared it with friends and guess what? ArtificialBananaBomb.com. You know, like the artificial banana flavor you used to taste in candy as a kid. Wacky Wafers, Laffy Taffy, Banana flavored Jello Pudding with Nilla Wafers. Was gonna add Banana flavored Moon Pie but I'll just stop right there. Look, I love banana pudding with Nilla Wafers too but in a bowl not in my glass. With all apologies to Brown Forman, Jasper Newton Daniel, and all of you who enjoy this stuff. It's just not for me.
I've been quietly hording away these bottles for a while! It wasn't until this week that I noticed they are getting harder to find! I got 2017 bottles of this stuff. Maybe 2.5 cases total hid away 750's. I got 1 case of 375's! 

I'm gonna say its official! People have caught on to this!
Ugh this is what I‚Äôm afraid of. I absolutely **hate** bananas and the flavor sticks out like a knife in anything with them in it.

I‚Äôm afraid to try this because I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll taste like bananas, or if it‚Äôll be that weird rum funk (which I do like) that some people associate with bananas for whatever reason
Areed on both counts. C919 was an excellent batchh for ECBP, and this Jack Daniels easily competes in the same league
L-18 is the Rick No. Think you‚Äôre misreading No. as N9 because of the superscript (I did the same thing).

Speaking of which, L-18 is where heritage barrels were aged so it‚Äôs about the highest spot they have I believe.
Jack Daniel‚Äôs produces an insane amount of barrels per day. It‚Äôs hard for me to imagine them not keeping up with demand for barrel proof, assuming the yield is higher and the barrels are good enough, they can just allocate more barrels to the high proof product.
My picture could be wrong, sorry. I drank this from a 2oz sample so I just searched Google for a bottle image and this is what I came up with
/r/bourbon isn‚Äôt exclusively about bourbon, despite the name. It‚Äôs more of a generic American whiskey sub that‚Äôs mostly bourbon.

People discuss rye, TN whiskey, corn whiskey, etc. on here every day
Ah, the age-old argument of whether or not the Lincoln County Process makes a bourbon not a bourbon

We'll see, I messaged him here and outside of Reddit. If I hear anything back I'll let you know for sure.
These are single barrels so it's always going to be a roll of the dice.  There are definitely a bunch of ho hum bottles.  There are some tasty one out there though.  The 375ml bottles are the way to go.
Do you grab certain proofs or anything you can get?
Thanks for that! Learning something everyday
Do you know the proof / ABV on your particular sample? I keep hearing that JD single barrel is amazing below a certain proof cutoff, and overwhelmingly hot above that cutoff. Would be interesting to know what range your review falls in.
Nah I think you're good. They must have changed the labeling at some point, but I can't find any info online.
And also, Jack Daniels *is* bourbon.
Ah, will be using this in the future. Thanks for the share
66.8% (133.6) - I found this miss marked in a gas station for 40$. That's all the info I have in my notes.
My experience has been that the January, February, and March dated bottles are best for my taste profile. I've never gone wrong grabbing those thus far. They tend to be the richer, and most oily.   


Quick Story I went into total wine and brought a 375 of ah march bottle. It was rich and good, There were September 750ml bottles full. The 1/2's had like 18 of them there, so on return I brought 3, so 15 left.  Came back 2 days later and none were left. 

Someone else figured it out, and cleaned it out! The good one's go really quick where I live. Some are great, some are mediocre. They all are good. Its just that some are better then others.
I dont, sorry. I messaged my friend about it so if I find out I'll let you know
130p. I search out and get the sub 130p and they are all incredible. Over 130p and they begin to lose a little balance and get a bit hotter (but still tasty).
Just heard back, this one was 133.6 proof/66.8%
They just exclude it from the label for fun. Got it.
Cool, thanks dude. Long time no see!
Fascinating. I‚Äôll have to check my bottle and see which month it is. It‚Äôs good either way, but if it‚Äôs not in line with your results I‚Äôll have to seek out another using your strategy when the time comes for a replacement.

Edit: Checked my bottle and it‚Äôs 12.3.19. Go figure. I wonder if I get any ‚Äúwrap around‚Äù benefit because I‚Äôm only a month off. Is it the cold weather that helps with bottling? Or do they select a batch of barrels for the year and prioritize them for the year based on quality?
Thanks! Supposedly one of the hot ones, I guess.
I know dude. Once this COVID thing is over - I have a 2014 ECBP with your name on it."

**Nose:** Vanilla, pastry, lemon, clean sharp smoke, honey, toffee, tart fruit, floral, sweet sweet vanilla char

**Taste:** Toffee, slight funk, big sweet smoke, lemon, clean sweet vanilla, the complex flavor thickens into a delicious kind of rich toffee & pastry malt with clean gritty smoke you can almost chew on. But it still remains a very balanced medium level smoke that lets lots of other sweet Scotch flavors come thru. Beautiful stuff

**Finish:** Looong finish of rich toffee, lightly charred smoke notes, delicious chocolate

****************

These are both amazing, hard to pick a favorite honestly. Very consistent feel from the distillery despite being distilled almost 10 years apart. Big clean smoke that feels soft and huge at the same time, with a balanced feel that lets lot of sweet Scotchy flavors through. Everything just feels so on point, I wouldn't change a thing in either of these. A nice pleasant, floral, and malty version of heavy smoke that leaves the palate feeling lightly smoky and sweet, it's a delicious counterpoint to the insane peat assault of an Islay(which I love don't get me wrong).

Never had an Ardmore but they both sound amazing. Hah,  *rich toffee & pastry malt with clean gritty smoke you can almost chew on,* what's not to like? Nice review, clean and crisp.
This is high quality content and and awesome side by side!
Ardmore is another one of those distilleries I'm sad to not see more IB's of (SMWS seems to get a fair amount, it was almost enough for them to get me to stick around). The difference between these and their lame-ass OB lineup is practically Bowmore-ian.
Great side by side. Interesting to hear the consistency since Ardmore was still using direct fires stills back in 2000.
Oh wow, never had an Ardmore? With your history and experience in the Scotch world I'm surprised. There's not a lot of non-Islay smoke bombs out there, so I would definitely recommend it. I'd say Ledaig is closer to Islay, Ardmore is more similar to Talisker but with less Island and more warm malty Highland. It's a heavier smoke than things like Highland Park or Glen Scotia/Campbeltown.
Thanks, I appreciate it and I'm glad you enjoyed it!
The Ardmore Traditional Cask used to be great, it was one of my early single malt purchases. 46%, UCF, and super cheap, But yeah I think they did away with it in favor of some 40% crap now. I've never had a bad IB from them tho.
That's interesting, thanks for the info. If I were looking for differences I might say that even though they are both rather soft and balanced, the 2000 is maybe a bit moreso. But the 2000 isn't a single barrel, so that could just be written off as good blending to me.
Nope, but I will have to take the plunge. I feel like I've just made a single circuit around the Scotch world and have missed a few, to say the least. There really is nothing like Scotch Whisky, IMHO. The best thing is there is always fantastic bottles out there, new and old. So, I've seen many available over the years but just took a pass on them - my mistake, obviously. I've had their non-peated version, an Ardlair 6 year old, bourbon cask aged, Signatory 63.3%. I think this is one that u/HawkI84 (I think) reviewed a while ago and really liked. Ardmore is killing it. Thanks again for that review.
Idk if I'd say ""great"", but yeah, the Traditional Cask was solid stuff, esp for $30. I'd really like to see an age stated, ncf range @46% from them.
There's so many distilleries out there, we all have those ones that we've always been curious about but just never got around to trying. And I didn't realize that Ardlair was unpeated Ardmore, interesting. 

>There really is nothing like Scotch Whisky, IMHO

I'll drink to that!
Well it was great by my standards back then in my earlier Scotch days haha, but yeah it has been quite a while"
"Review #168: Craigellachie 10 Clan Denny, 46%",,https://i.redd.it/9mt8dokiwhd51.jpg,"These are interesting. Just a basic little 10yr refill cask but it's bottled right at 46% with no chill filtration or color added which will always get my attention. I'm pretty sure it's a single cask too, it says distilled January of 08 and only 429 bottles.

*****

**Craigellachie 10 Clan Denny, refill hogshead, 46%**

**Nose:** Decent body and character, caramel, dessert pastry, gentle green apple, thick barley malt, sweet vanilla, peppery spice, lemon, some banana and buttered popcorn spirity funk. 

**Taste:** Caramel, clean sweet pastry malt, mild ethanol and funk, peppery spice, light vanilla, pastry, lemon citrus. Very little spirity funk or ethanol burn, a lot of the sweet malty character comes through with a light touch of really nice barrel notes. Extremely well balanced with a nice oily mouthfeel, great stuff and really tasty.

**Finish:** A really nice sweet and malty finish with caramel, sweet barley malt, vanilla, lemon and spice zing

*****

This is a killer little malty Scotch for the price. I think it was $40-$50 but I got it sale for $33, at that price it can't be beat. I'm a big fan of Craigellachie and this stuff showcases their delicious viscous malt beautifully. It was a little spirity when I first opened it, almost tasted sherried with the funk levels. It has held on to that a little but for the most part it's opened up beautifully.

Yea, these Clan Denny are just interesting at a great price to boot. This sounds really good. Have you tried the Bunnahabhain or Fettercairn? Great review.
Gotta ask where you got that poster in the back from?
Sounds nice! Craigellachie is an underrated distillery IMO.
No, I remember you saying the Bunna was really good but I haven't seen it. K&L had the fettercairn for the same low price as this but I never jumped on it. Regretting it now
I get that a lot haha. Honestly I don't even know, I've had it forever. But if you google ""monkey drinking poster"" it's not hard to find.
Agreed, they have a really solid beefy malty character. And happy cake day!

That's interesting, I haven't seen a lot of Whisky Galore bottlings before. Funny yours had a bunk cork too haha, although to be fair it is a pretty old bottle. 

This Clynelish was nice, nothing amazing but it was enjoyable. I've been using it to blend with other stuff to add a smooth nondescript kind of maltiness to other stuff. It smooths stuff out with a rough edge

*****

**Four Roses Single Barrel Private Selection, K&L OESV 9yr/10mo 53%**

**Nose:** Floral, perfumy cherry, cool menthol spice, toffee, sharp tobacco and charred woody edge, chocolate. Nice mix of floral liveliness and richer wood notes

**Taste:** Surprisingly thick and cohesive. I was expecting a standard lively and hot FRPS after the nose but this is unique. Syrupy thick mouthfeel, sweet oak spice, sweet syrupy cherry, bright floral sweetness, brown sugar, rich caramel, vanilla, minty spice. It's sweet and thick for a FRPS but still lively and spicy

**Finish:** Spice heat and sweet syrupy cherry builds, caramel, sweet spicy oak, mild mint

*****

Thick and cohesive for a FRPS, and very sweet, feels unique while still holding onto the standard flavors I love in these. And a lot of fun too it's tasty. I think the ABV helps here, keeps it somewhat under control but without feeling too weak like lower 50's barrels sometimes do. I still prefer the hotter more action-packed barrels but this is one of the better ones I've had that is under 55%.

**Taste:** Dry, woody, nice balanced dried fruits, warm mellow grape, darkly sweet, orange, caramel and mellow fruits, dry rich wood. It's good, but it feels too dry and mellow. It's missing some pizzaz

**Finish:** Big warm finish that finally comes alive a little more. Dry, smooth toasted wood, smooth lively spice, rich mellow fruits, brighter orange, sweet vanilla

Nice review! Haven't heard of this distillery, but then, there's lots of em ;)
I was just reading up about this domaine last night and was wondering why the prices were so high relative to most other similar age/cask strength armagnac. This review quiets my fomo a little.
I would have to try more, this seems like good quality stuff. Is this mellower feel pretty representative of other bottlings you've had from them?
Me neither, but according to xRHx they are a big name that fetches a premium for some reason. Off topic, but could I change my flair to ""Fruit Whiskey?""
Haven‚Äôt gotten the chance to try other offerings from them
Absolutely! Done."

**Taste:** Big, dark, and hot but still quite smooth and balanced. Huge dark toasted wood, heavy brooding spice, dark caramel, hot cherry zing, cocao, sweet syrupy fruitiness.

I like this one a lot.
Good stuff!
That batch is right up there with 03-RB. One of my favorites.
I have to cop to going out and getting an LL/G bottle when all the chatter on that series started. Then by confirmation bias or just good whiskey, I enjoyed the hell out of it and felt like it could go toe-to-toe with Stagg Jr. and ECBP. 

Haven‚Äôt picked up another WTRB since; still working on the LL/G and too many other things to buy and drink.

But I also liked the previous batch (112.x) very much, though not quite as much as 116.8. The Turkey fanboys seemed to think that the 112 had been a misstep and I hadn‚Äôt had an earlier version to compare.
I love I can always find it and it is under $50. One of the truly great values in barrel proof bourbon. For me it is up there with Stagg Jr, ECBP, and 1792 Full Proof. However, unlike this others I mentioned I can find this one any day of the week at a great price.
I just bought a bottle of this in the $40 range? Worth every dime.
Definitely. Same here.
Me too!
We should thank Longbranch for soaking up the stocks that used to go into Rare Breed and forced this one to come out.
it's catching on where i live, most stores i check now are either out or only have a couple left."

*****

**Glen Ord 12 2007, Signatory Un-Chillfiltered, Hogsheads #312743+312744, 46% (done blind)**

**Nose:** A nice malty nose. Thick bready malt, pastry, rich apple fruitiness, banana, sweet cake frosting, light floral, spice tingle. Classic malty notes, very smooth and easy but thick.

**Taste:** No surprises after the nose. Thick sweet bready malt, thick pastry, smooth warm fruits, floral, sticky caramel, light sweet vanilla, nice lively spice kick that is delicious and flavorful but not ""hot."" Thick but also smooth and sweet, and not a heavy barrel influence. Very nice.

**Finish:** Delicious spice builds with smooth sweet malty flavors, warm and embracing maltiness that is so nice.

* I'm a sucker for a good malt bomb, and this is it. Doesn't taste spirity enough to be some young refill barrel, but it's not a heavy wood influence either. So maybe it's slightly older, 15-20 years? And in that healthy 50-55% range I think. It could be 100 different things, Gonna say someone who knows their malt like one of the Glens maybe.

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** I think the 46% ABV can explain the balanced feel I mistook for age, I was just expecting another cask strengther here. It's a full flavored and nice feel for sure. I will be keeping an eye out for Glen Ord in the future. I'm also very interested in the idea of mixing two casks. I had previously been wary of this, thinking maybe it was just barrels that weren't good enough to bottle on their own.

Nice. Glen Ord is massively underrated and it's a crime I can't find more of it. Also, Serge is a bigger fan of mixing two casks than he is having single casks.
Great review
Still don't remember what the bottling was? These 46% UCF's can be excellent, but I've definitely had some duds before too

Oh geez, sounds awesome! I thought you meant one of the standard 46% UCF bottlings. I've only seen them at cask strength when a store or group does a barrel pick
Right on, I'll have to check it out. Yeah I'm really curious about exploring more mixed casks, it seems like a cool way of dialing in more balanced flavors. Lord knows I've had enough single barrel duds, so it's not like they're messing with something that aint broke
Yep, this one was from the Whisky Exchange in London, my lovely fiance grabbed one as a gift while she was studying there
> Yeah I'm really curious about exploring more mixed casks, it seems like a cool way of dialing in more balanced flavors.

FYI, I've been impressed by the multiple (usually 2 or 3) cask# bottlings I've had from a couple of different IB's including Signatory and have taken to seeing multiple casks vatted together as a good sign rather than a bad sign, when evaluating an IB release on spec.
I've heard similar from some others, and I'm starting to come around on this idea myself. I'd like to try some more. I actually have a mortlach 12 signatory UCF from 2 casks, maybe it's time to open that one"

No peanut?
Any chance you've had the regular KC? If so, how do they compare?
This was my first ever bourbon I tried when I turned 21. My sister lives on the bourbon trail and when I went to visit her, we headed to the distillery, did the tour and at the end I got this bottle with my thumb print on the top. That bottle lasted me 3 years, good times.
Man KC picks are my favorite! I just picked up my 3rd
This may be a stupid question but Local store has picks from a barrel in 2009. I have one and enjoy it, $47 bottle. Would it be worth it to buy a couple and wait a few years to open?
I opened up an 11yr single barrel KC pick last night and loved it, really looking forward to opening the 14yr pick this week, for the price KC has these older barrel proof single barrels on lock
Honestly I've never gotten the whole peanut thing with Knob Creek. It's so hot. I get a nuttiness from Whiskies sometimes, but it's more of a smooth earthy kind of thing, never specifically ""peanut."" And this is coming from someone who loves peanuts
I hate ‚Äòem, and have yet to try a Beam product where I couldn‚Äôt distinctively taste them. Albeit sometimes less so in an older cask strength whiskey like this.
Actually I haven't had standard KC in some time, sorry. You've got me curious tho, I'll have to see if I can pick up a mini somewhere maybe
I felt like the barrel strength intensified the things I like about regular without intensifying the beam peanut. Almost to the point you don‚Äôt appreciate any peanut? I feel like knob creek regular doesn‚Äôt have much beam peanut anyway.
That's an awesome way to celebrate 21, sounds like a really great memory.
There is always that urge to stock up on limited stuff that you won't see again, but for me something has to be pretty special to stockpile. There will always be the next special bottle, trust me. Another thing you might find is that your tastes change. You go to open one of these after several years of expanding your palate and trying other great bottles, and suddenly you find you dont even like it as much as you used to. It's happened to me several times. I dont know your personal tastes or this particular bottle, but I'd say if you decide to get a backup dont go crazy, just get the one.
Yeah they are a great deal for sure. The age and proof is just killer for the price
I too love peanuts and always get disappointed when people claim peanut notes, but my tongue finds none to be found. I think it's a byproduct of the yeast strain used and it's the closest thing people can draw parallels too.  

To get my peanut fix I guess I'll just have to put peanut butter in my ramen noodles and eat it in the corner like a savage.
I also thought it was really hot, 120 proof is a lot. Pikesville is kind of where I top out for proof, knob creek is a safe spot and OWA is probably a bullseye at 107 for me.
It's my every day sipper if I want bourbon and don't want to think about what to drink. I take my bourbon with one ice cube. That's it. So good.
Thanks for the reply. This all checks out. I like exploring new things. I probably will get another bottle. It probably will be enjoyed sooner than later ü§£
I had success looking for nuttiness in general instead of peanuts or almond or MaRzIpAn specifically. Once I could make this flavor association, peanuts or peanut butter would occasionally leap out at me. Don‚Äôt try to force it; you‚Äôll know it when it hits.
my first knob creek sib was spicy peanut butter. The next two were not as peanut buttery and I've been very disappointed. The more peanut flavor the better.
I don't mind the heat at all on high proof stuff like this as long as there's some good flavor and a semblance of balance"
Reviews #165/166: Talisker 10 & 18,,https://i.redd.it/k5exv36rkca51.jpg,"I Love Talisker 10, really helped me understand how great Scotch can be. My wallet hates Talisker 10, it is the reason I spend too much money on Scotch lol
I remember liking Talisker 10 in my earlier Scotch days, but that was a long time ago so I thought I should revisit it. Also along for the ride is Talisker 18. Should be fun. Courtesy of u/Apuch23 and u/unbreakablesausage

*****

**Talisker 10, 45.8%**

**Nose:** Rich chocolatey smoke, toffee, vanilla, nice toasted oak, briny sea notes. Rich nose with lots of thick chocolate and smoke

**Taste:** Smooth chocolate, toffee, thick sweet smoke, mild peppery heat, chocolatey toasted wood, vanilla, sweet smooth char. For how smoky and oaky it is it has an incredibly balanced feel. It's a smoke bomb but it's a very dignified and well-crafted smoke bomb.

**Finish:** brine, chocolate smoke, vanilla, sweet mild char

* I haven't had this in a long time, it's even better than I remember. A very well-crafted sweet & smoky Scotch. It's a great middle ground between the watered down thinness of Johnnie Walker black and the peat assault of an Islay. Huge balanced smoke with lots of smooth chocolate and rich barrel notes, the flavor flows very well with a whole lot of character.

Score: **7**

*****

**Talisker 18, 45.8%**

**Nose:** Malty and spirity with lighter smoke than the 10. Sweet malt, clean rich smoke, brine, menthol, green apple, toffee, milk chocolate, sweet wine funk, spice

**Taste:** Big clean smoke, brine, caramel and wood, milk chocolate, vanilla, sweet fruity malt, delicate wine sweetness. Sweet and complex, has some heavy smoke and richness but lots of more nimble sweet flavors as well. A very fun and tasty Scotch

**Finish:** Sweet char and spice, vanilla, light menthol, smoke, lingering chocolate and sweet smoke.

* The 10yr is more of a rich smoke bomb, but this is the more complex and interesting of the 2. It has a sweet and malty feel but still has tons of rich flavor and delicious clean smoke. It's very well crafted, the complexity and pleasant flavor have a delicious and effortless feel. A really nice expression of Talisker, I'm very impressed with both of these.

Score: **8**

I have both of these bottles. I wouldn't call any Talisker a smoke bomb, there is some, not a bomb.
As a Scotch newbie, someone recommended me Talisker 10 to get a good peated starter Scotch, so I did. And after tasting it for a few times, I'm pretty sure this will be a permanent one in the collection.
Cool review. I think I'm going to have a Talisker today now that you have put me in the mood!
Ahhh, the unexpected third option that doesn‚Äôt involve sports :).
This is a great side by side. Love the 10. I had the 18 years ago and wasn't that impressed. It seemed kind of flat. Sounds like it could have been the bottle I had. After this review,  I will have to give it a go again. Thanks for sharing.
I've gotten 2 bottles for $40 each this week.  I only say this to make you jealous.
As one of the better Scotches that you can regularly find in a bar, I think it's a perfect bottle to see how great Scotch can be. Awesome username!
I'm right there with you.  It's a really fantastic bottle of Scotch.
To me it's more of a pepper bomb with a dash of smoke.
Theres a lot of smoke here to me, even if it's not quite up to Islay levels. Certainly a lot more than some of the lightly smoky Scotch I can think of. But everyone's tastes can be different.
It's a great peat introduction for a beginner
Nice! I drank all my mine doing this review
Thanks, and welcome back to civilization!
$72 here. Control state. Outrageous for one of my favorites :(
I have a feeling you make all of the whiskey drinkers jealous. ;)

Reviews #163/164: Laphroaig Cairdeas 2018 vs 2019 (done blind),,https://i.redd.it/ek755w55mb951.jpg,"A side-by-side tasting of the previous two Cairdeas releases. 2018 was aged in 1st fill Bourbon barrel and then finished in Fino casks, which is a lighter style of sherry. 2019 Was a cask strength version of the TripleWood bottling which is aged in a combination of Bourbon, sherry and quarter casks. I reviewed these blind with a reveal at the end. Sample courtesy of u/rrrabarbaro

*****

**Blind Sample 1**

**Nose:** Thick medicinal peat, rich wood, hot spice, chocolatey wood and char, brine, vanilla, cutting tart sweetness, tons of heavy peat and hot numbing menthol

**Taste:** Hot, huge briny Laphroaig peat, thick viscous mouthfeel with a lot of peat, chocolate, hot peppery spice, sweet charred wood notes

**Finish:** Huge, long, and hot peaty finish. Mean Laphroaig peat and peppery spice builds huge, tart fruit, sweet vanilla char and tons of mouth numbing menthol

******************

**Blind Sample 2** 

**Nose:** Clean medicinal Laphroiag peat, tar, brine, malt, caramel, creamy sweetness, clean vanilla icing, light char and menthol. 
 
**Taste:** Smooth sweet medicinal Frog peat, vanilla, creamy rich caramel, easy thick sweetness, milk chocolate, floral, sweet wood notes

**Finish:** Clean medicianl peat and caramel with smooth and light fruity sweetness, lightly charred ashy vanilla, very Froggy and pleasant

*****

1 is definitely the bruiser here. A bigger and hotter mouthfeel, heavier on the classic Frog peat and vanilla, more charred flavor and chocolatey wood. 2 Is lighter and smoother, it's creamy and peaty with a light easy sweetness. It still has plenty of heavy Frog peat but it's cleaner and sweeter. Neither one of these come across as super sherried to me. 1 has no obvious sherry influence that I can pick up, just feels like a big hot & woody peat monster Frog with maybe some underlying tart sweetness. 2 is by far the sweeter of the 2 but it's creamy and very well-integrated, doesn't come across as a fruity or sulfury sherry sweetness. 

Both are excellent, they are different enough in style to have their own strengths. No clear winner, just personal preference. 1 suits me better, I like that mean peat assault. But 2 is an excellent easy-sipping sweet peat monster. I think I can guess which one is which just based on ABV and style, 1 is 2019 and 2 is 2018.

2019 is some mind-blowing stuff. Great value too.

I think I should grab as many bottles as possible.
I really like the 2019. I was there for the Feis Ile festival last year and picked up a couple bottles. I gave one to my dad, which I regret, because even though he enjoys scotch, the rarity and deliciousness was lost on him I think. I've been keeping the other for special occasions because it's the best bottle of Laphroaig I've had.
I almost got a Triple Wood Cairdeas today, a Friend of mine was in an Airport and saw it texted me asking if that was what I was looking for, and between him texting me and me replying ( 10 minutes) the 2 bottles available were sold... :( :( 

It sucks I can't get it locally.
This is my kind of blind tasting! I just did the same last week. I like the Fino better than the Triple Wood CS. Not by a lot, but a noticeable amount. I can‚Äôt get enough of the Fino Cask. My favorite whisky to date! I‚Äôll buy any remaining bottles when I find them!

Ugh. I love Laphroaig.
Nice SBS! I get a bit of nuttiness from the Fino, and some sharp youthful edges. Still need to open a 2019, but it's already summer, ah well...
Whew!! That triple wood is seriously hot! I definitely needed a bit of water in it to make it palatable, but it was still delicious! 

and thanks for the review!!!
Found the 2019 in Massachusetts for $75. I might have to pull the trigger even though I've never had it. They also have the 2018 and 2017.
A great review, as usual, Bucky. Think you nailed it: ""both are excellent...no clear winner, just personal preference.""
2015 is the only Cairdeas I felt compelled to stock up on, but hey everyone's got their own fvorite. This is a really good one.
I'd be all over it if I could find it in Japan, but so far it's a no-go.
> even though he enjoys scotch, the rarity and deliciousness was lost on him I think

Yeah I've been there. It's a hard call, because we get so deep into the hobby we forget what it's even like to be a casual Scotch drinker. Something amazing and rare to a die-hard Whisky geek might not mean a whole lot, or even be enjoyable, to a casual drinker. 

I'm sure in your case tho a gift from his son means a lot more than you think :)
I'm sorry dude :( 

FWIW I wouldn't put either of these any higher than the 10CS, hopefully you're able to get that one. Cairdeas' are fun little experiments, but 10CS is the OG real shit Laphroaig, hands down
[deleted]
Right on haha. Like I said in my review, there isn't really a clear winner here just personal preference. I may have preferred the 2019, but both are outstanding
Yeah it's a hot one. The big abv difference between these made it kind of pointless to do as a blind tasting honestly
I love the TW Cairdeas with about 5ml of water to the 60ml dram, with that touch of water it becomes my favourite Laphroaig
My aunt picked me up the '19 Cairdias in Mass (I'm in PA, a draconian control state) and I love it. I have been on the hunt for a CS for half a year now with no luck. I am pretty sure I dont remember seeing it on the PLCB list, so PA is likely a no ho, and I looked in Ohio last weekend, but the area I was in only had 3 stores that were mostly stocked with cheap scotch (think JW and The Cutty Sark) and walls of bourbon. I'm glad to see someone speak that highly of the CS, as I almost gave up looking, but if it's close to the '19, I'm gonna have to find one.
No, I'm in Ontario Canada.
Where our State controlled liquor control board picks and chooses what we get to buy,  If we want to special order, a bottle usually costs twice normal retail since we pay full retail of the host country + shipping + handling + very heavy taxes.
The C√†irdeas releases have been stellar in my experience. I‚Äôm hunting for a 2020 now.
there was a hiccup in 2016-2017 imo. 2016(Madeira) I absolutely hated, and 2017(Quarter Cask CS) was good but definitely took some warming up to. I feel like the last 2 years has slowly gotten Cairdeas back on track and I'm very hopeful for 2020"

**Finish:** Builds to epic heights with hot cherry and menthol, chocolatey wood, tons of delicious hot spice

*****

Both of these are delicious, and I never noticed before but they aren't as heavily oaky as other bruisers like ECBP and KCSB. Still epicly huge and hot in the same vein with lots of corn and hot cherry sweetness, and tons of hot spice. 1 is hot and punchy, much more spice heat and brash flavor. 2 is a little richer and more well rounded, thicker mouthfeel, richer oak, more syrupy-sweet cherry, but without losing any of it's huge brash character. Both are good but 2 is the clear winner for me.

Batch 12 was a fantastic release. I've never had 8 but I'm not surprised by the results
Always found this to be a bargain for $50
Have you had batch 13? Can you compare?
I just had some 8 and i agree 100% with your tasting notes. Nice review!
When I had a clear winner I feared the worst, it seems like the consensus is that the newer batches(9 and up) are better. So I'm pleasantly surprised my bottle won.
For sure, if you're lucky enough to find it. This 2017 batch I have is the last time I was able to find any
Sorry, I have not
That makes sense. I definitely think Stagg Jr is getting better as they go. We know they have a ton of stock aging so hopefully the trend will continue

*****

**Edradour 9yr 2010 The Ultimate, 1st fill sherry butt, 59% (done blind)**

**Nose:** I'm not sure what to make of this nose. Dark and brooding, pretty sure it's Scotch. I'm thinking it's some kind of heavy wine finish, but it's super smooth and dark. Malt, milk chocolate, tart berry, sweet vanilla, toffee, wood, sweet dark brooding fruits, black cherry, decent spice kick.

**Taste:** Hot wine sweetness, tart berry, chocolate, cherry, big hot cinnamon spice, just a little brighter and hotter than the nose but still quite dark. Still thinking it's Scotch. Nose totally had me thinking port, I could see it being really dark sherry now too. Opens up a little brighter and spicier with some air

**Finish:** Toffee, malt, dark tart fruits, chocolate, big spice zing

* I'm thinking it's a wine finished Scotch, it's sweet but dark and smooth. Doesn't quite feel like sherry, so maybe something Port aged. In the low to mid 50's ABV. All the cinnamon and spice has me worried it might be some kind of weird wine finished Bourbon/Rye, but it just seems to have that thick malty feel to me so I'm sticking with my Scotch guess.

I had their 10 and kind of moved away from the distillery afterwards but it‚Äôs good to hear there is some hope. Just as a note I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúhate‚Äù the 10
But paid a handsome dollar for it here in the states and could easily find better for the price point. Thanks for the review :)
Their independent bottlings seem to be much more popular than their core line, I bought this one about a month ago and love it
Same here, the 10 just turned me off from edradour for a long time
I think this one was a Whiskybase bottling, did you get this exact one or one like it? Because there seem to be a ton of these ""Ultimate"" sherried Edradours around
The standart 10y and 12y were pretty meh whiskys when I tasted them, but their Signatory Vinatge stuff is also really good. I had the 10 y SV with 436% from multiple years and all werre really good and currently own a 9y old cask strength from 2010 with 57.1, which also just tastes amazing.
The 10 yr OB was so meh but I love the signatory 10 yr... one of my favorites!"

Really enjoyed my bottle of this, one of the better Armagnacs I've had. Just ordered some more from FD.  It's crazy how much more expensive these L'Encantada casks are here in TX; my local chain has a 1989 La Freche for $249 (a 750ml, but still).
Nice review. Do you think you‚Äôre going to grab a bottle? I was surprised that it‚Äôs still available on Fine Drams.
I'm lucky to have K&L here in california, but even their prices are a little more and going up all the time on stuff like this all the time. Just out of curiosity, did you put anything else on your order?
Yeah, I'm going to order it this weekend hopefully. Its exactly what I needed to distract me from that glendronach!
I also ordered a Chateau de Pomes Peberere 1975; I got the 1964 on my last order and it's good (wish it was cask strength though), so I decided to try another from them. 

I already have a bottle of the L'Encantada 1992 del Cassou. It's good, although not quite as good the La Freche for me. It has a little more fruit, and a nice creamy quality (almost buttery), but not as much of the earthier notes that I enjoy so much in the La Freche (oak, chocolate, tobacco).
I get scared by the lower proof ones, I've been in the Whiskey world for a long time and I'm just too used to big bold cask strength flavors at this point. I looked at that Cassou, but I felt like the ABV might just be too low. I already put an order in, I kind of wish I'd grabbed one now based on your description. Sounds really good. I like the earthy oak heavy flavors, but I also like the creamy butterscotch kind of bottles too"

**Blind Sample 1**

**Nose:** Dry sweet fruitiness, leather, graham cracker, menthol, holiday spice, fig, green apple. Understated sweet sherry

**Taste:** Caramel, vanilla pastry, sweet balanced sherry fruits, orange, nice warm holiday spice and a little heat. Lightly malty and sherry sweet, an easy sipper. Not huge or complex but very pleasant and balanced.

**Finish:** Builds really nice and pleasant with warm smooth spices, caramel, dry sweet sherry

**Blind Sample 2** 

**Nose:** Luxurious caramel, sweet warm sherry, rich cherry, strawberry, caramel malt, mild wood spice, sweet plum

**Finish:** Caramel and smooth warm fruits, chocolate strawberries, plum. Big finish, lingers warm and sweet for a long time.

**************************

These are both nice. Both are surprisingly malty and easy, not what I would call sherry bombs at all(but I may just be too used to Cask Strength stuff at this point). 1 is on the drier side, lighter overall. A very easy sipper. 2 is richer, with more luxurious and decadent flavor. In case you can't tell, 2 is the clear winner for me. It's more rich and full, bigger sweet sherry flavors and thick malt. 1 just feels a little thin in comparison, and the dry sherry doesn't do it for me like the more decadent sweetness of 2. 1 is a little hotter as well, in a mild kind of way. The flavor just flows better in 2, right into the amazing finish.

I had a feeling pretty much right away, but I kept an open mind because I've been surprised in blind tastings before. But in the end the old bottling reigns supreme.

Another excellent review. An honest side by side. One may not be better than the other, just a bit different.
Great review. I have heard so much praise of the Glendronach 15 but I‚Äôve not gelled with it. I have a new bottling so I sometimes wonder if the people really praising it are doing so on the basis of experience of older bottles. It has a nice nose but it doesn‚Äôt translate onto the palate for me. It‚Äôs a pretty average dram IMO to be honest. I concur with most of your notes on bottle 1. The 18yo on the other hand is a decadent sherry bomb!
Excellent work.  Was there a notable color difference side by side?
This is my favorite pour.  Thanks for the review.
Is the bottle date printed on the outside of these boxes or only on the bottle itself? I'm getting increasingly inspired to go hunt through my local bottle shops, but they might not like me opening each box
Awesome review! I'm glad to see your thoughts on the differences between the old and new Revival as I haven't had a chance to try them for myself.
[deleted]
Thanks, I've done these semi-blind as well and also preferred the older bottling slightly. That said, they were both outranked by 2017-2018-ish bottlings of 18 and 21 for me. Some put the 15 at the top of the line!
An excellent review. Thank you for posting this.
The old bottling was definitely better to me tho
Completely agree, the new 15 is a solid scotch but nothing amazing to me. You never know though, your bottle could end up growing on you with time.
If you like the 18 you likely would love the old 15.

It's the 100% Oloroso that makes the difference (plus the few extra years in most bottles).

I still quite like the new 15 (more than you by the sounds), but the old was an absolute belter, the new just good. The 12 on the other hand generally disappoints me, I feel like there must be quite a bit of refill sherry in the, as it's nowhere near a sherry bomb. I get it's only 12, but put it next to Aberlour 12 NCF (which is still double cask like the standard 12 offering), Glenfarclas 12 or BenRiach 12 and they all blow it away in terms of sherry oomph. The Glenfarclas is a bit rougher, but it's also cheaper, with the definitely superior Glenfarclas 15 usually going for a similar price to GlenDronach 12.
No, I was looking for a color difference and didnt really see one. But I poured these in 2 goes, and it can be hard to check color in a small glencairn pour.
Cool, thanks for reading
It's a laser code on the bottle. But if it says aged in oloroso on the tube, it's an old one. The new one says aged in oloroso and px(like the one I used in my picture)

EDIT: autocorrect
Thanks it was fun. What are your thoughts on the old 15? I didnt love it as much as I remember, still good though.
Honestly Glendronach 12 is really good, I would start there before splurging on this 15yr for double the cost. Glengoynes are also really good. For sherry bombs I tend to think cask strength, and Abunadh is very well regarded. I think they are probably very consistent in quality, I wouldn't worry too much about nitpicking different batches. Glenfarclas 105 is good too.
Batch 64 is fantastic!
64 was the best recent batch of A'bunadh - not sure where you live but it's recent enough to still be on some shelves around the world, so keep an eye out.

I'm a massive sherry head, and Aberlour and GD are probably my two favourite distilleries - batch 64 was the best A'bunadh I've tasted since the 40s (to give you can idea I currently have 4 batches open).

Glenfarclas 15 is another good one for heavily sherried (and easily the stand out of the Glenfarclas core age statement range - esp in bang for buck), but it's not cask strength - if you're after that A'bunadh, 105 or possibly even Glengoyne Cask Strength are the obvious ones without breaking the bank.
Aberlour A'Bunadh is the best. Everyone like to think they are so sophisticated and hate on anything newer. Everything you read is whining about today's quality. 
Yes older batches were better, that doesn't mean new still isn't amazing. 
You will be blown away by any batch of A'Bunadh, they are all amazing.
My favorite Sherry Bomb out of the Highlands is Balvenie 15. It‚Äôs been matured exclusively in a single European oak sherry butt for at least 15 years. However if you are going to spend the $120-$140 for this bottle, as a note, there are actually two versions of this dram, a first and a second fill. Since your are looking for a sherry bomb, make sure you get the the first. I don‚Äôt think the bottle or container mentions whether it‚Äôs a first fill or second. The first fill is very dark, you almost can‚Äôt see through it. Good luck.
Agreed, neither of these really blew me away even though the 2015 was still really good. I have a 2017 18yr that I like a lot more.
I totally agree. The new 15 is very good, just nothing like the old. It‚Äôs like the old Macallan CS vs the new. While the new is good, the old is stunning.
I thought so and I‚Äôve been waiting but it‚Äôs nearly done and I‚Äôve tasted it over 3 months. I‚Äôm open to the possibility I got a bad bottle, because I think the 12 is pretty decent. And I absolutely love the 18.
It‚Äôs possible I have a below-par bottle of 15 because my notes just don‚Äôt align with other people‚Äôs and while we all have individual palates, that much divergence is rare for me. The 12 is okay and enjoyable, but I too prefer Glenfarclas (can only get 12 and 17 here). Would love to try Aberlour 12NCF. At some point I‚Äôll try another bottle of the 15 but that may be a while!
Sounds like you need bigger pours ü§£
Oohh thanks. Do you know if there's a similar external ""tell"" for the 18 given it's still exclusively oloroso?
I honestly haven't had it for quite a while so I don't recall any specific tasting notes. Generally, I thought it was really good for the price (somewhere between $90-105) when I purchased it. I think I grabbed some of the last couple of bottles in Oregon before they discontinued them.
I find the 15 FAR superior to the 12.  What I wouldn't recommend is the 18....sure it's more complex but it finishes with a phenolic peat note I don't want in my Speyside/Highlands sherry bombs at 130$
Glenfarclas 105 is about $40 for a 1L on fine drams btw
glengoyne cs batch 7 is stellar as well, don't see it mentioned much. 

their legacy series chapter one also really good for 48abv (you'd never know, ridiculously smooth), when it's available at glendronach 12's price.
> Everyone like to think they are so sophisticated and hate on anything newer. Everything you read is whining about today's quality.

I hope this isn't a dig on my review! I did it blind for this very reason, to remove any of the ""older is better"" bias. I agree with you modern stuff can still be fantastic, and I agree with you on Abunadh. I'm sure it's a pretty consistent Scotch and I wouldn't worry too much about nitpicking different batches.
A'bunadh is still definitely one of the best bang for buck cask strength sherry bombs around - no doubt. It's not that people whine about today's whisky and think everything old is better, it's just that as good as A'bunadh is, the old batches were AMAZING.

I mentioned above, and you can't necessarily tell by the colour, but a recent batch (64) was the best they've done in years. I have several bottles open and have tasted it blind against others in the 50s, and also not blind next to a Distillery Reserve 14yo single cask (first fill sherry butt) and nothing has swayed my opinion - best A'bunadh since the 40s... But before that they had definitely dropped in quality over the last 15-20 batches.

Unfortunately it's only natural - it's gotten too popular and they simply don't have the first fill Oloroso matured whisky old enough to fill the bottles at the old quality now.
You can tell by cask number which is mentioned on the bottle, but you have to take the word of the reviewers.
Ahhhh! Correction, Balvenie is a Speyside Scotch, not a Highland...
I didnt feel like this 15yr sample I drank was significantly better than the 12yr. The abv does help a lot, they would almost be neck and neck if the 12yr was 46%. And yeah the 18 is excellent
18 was never discontinued, there isn't really a ""new"" or ""old"" version like there is with the 15. Actually, if you look at the graph in [this article](https://wordsofwhisky.com/glendronach-is-a-lot-older-than-the-label-says/) we only just got out of 18yr bottlings with older-than-the-label contents this year. Theoretically any 18yr bottlings from 2014-2019 could have older Whisky in it than the label indicates.
Right on, Oregon can be good for checking that kind of stuff. I had a bottle in the bunker, I ended up trading it for 2 SAOS Rye 7/99's. I was always pretty happy with that trade
I absolutely love the 18 and you're the first person I've seen dislike it.

Interesting - do you know what bottling year you tasted?

I have a 2015, 17, 18 and 19 open üò¨ would be interesting to see which you didn't like.

I actually did a blind of a 15 from 2015, 18 from 2015 and 18 from 2018 - and I picked the 2018 Allardice as the odd one out. Makes a bit of sense, the others were the same age and all 3 were 100% Oloroso.

When you say you like the 15, were you referring to the old or new 15? Just thinking perhaps you don't like the more tannic 100% Oloroso maturation. I adore it, especially after it's had a bit of time in the glass.
I was also very disappointed by the 18.  I found it to be more subtle and mellow than the 10 but without a lot of extra complexity.  And I also found its peatiness to be a bit medicinal, which is not the type of peat profile I'm going for when I reach for Talisker.  Now I was a lot more inexperienced back then, so maybe I wasn't able to fully appreciate it at the time, but in any event that was definitely one of my biggest disappointments in terms of big purchases.  And I say that as a huge Talisker fan and someone who rates both the 10 and the DE very high.

Here was my review of it, if you were curious:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/8aqo6l/reviews_11_12_talisker_10_vs_talisker_18_side_by/
Glengoyne is one of the most underrated distilleries in the world. Rarely put out a bad whisky.
I'm sure just by looking at how unbelievable deep older A'Bunadh batches were, I would be describing them the same as this review goes.
Nothing towards this review. It's the common theme her on reddit
You're forgiven - Speyside is in the Highlands.
I do prefer a PX to Oloroso most certainly....but my issue was a phenolic peat in the finish, somewhat mild but definitely there.  I'm sorry I don't know the year...bottle is long gone.
I haven't tried the Talisker 18, but I certainly found that with the Caol Ila 18 and Ardbeg 19 the peat was faint and somehow sickly sweet (compared to their younger variants). I did try the Talisker 25 (45.8%), but it just does not justify its cost. For me older Islays that aren't cask strength are rarely worth the huge premium.
Interesting, I get no peat, not even a suggestion of it - and I'm generally quite peat sensitive (as I mostly avoid it unless it's really well balanced).

The only flavour similar to that that I do get from Allardice (and that makes sense as it's not peated) is the tannins from the Oloroso that I mentioned.

Would be interesting to know what it is and what creates it.

I much prefer Oloroso to PX - I find PX is much more a pure sugary sweet; Oloroso is this jammy fruitiness, brown sugar and toffee. That said with some of the older GlenDronach single casks I start preferring PX - I think over a long time in one cask you end up picking up quite a bit of oaky funk from the wood, and along with the tannic Oloroso fruit it can get quite dry and harsh. PX the time in the oak actually brings out the fruit, rather than just the sugar, and the vanilla oak goes great with the sugary PX as well.
It could have been a one off year....maybe looking to create complexity a bbl or two that had phenolics were tossed in.

I have not had a chance to try the 21 to see if it persists in older bottlings.  Just can't find it to buy it.

It's definitely not barrel tannin...I'm quite familiar."

**Blind Sample 1**

**Nose:** Maple, brown sugar, cherry, orange, bright hot clove spice, caramel, mint, sweet charred wood

**Taste:** Cool mint and hot cherry, brown sugar, hot spice burn undercurrent, chocolate wood. Rich yet mellow flavor with a really nice spice zing

**Finish:** Tannic wood, chocolate, sweet root beer char, lingering hot spice zing that feels really good.

*****

**Blind Sample 2** 

**Nose:** Strong mint and cherry, chocolate, smooth toasted wood, toffee, stale must. Tame and smooth

**Taste:** Smooth and light. Caramel, sweet cherry, mint, clean smooth wood, very mild herbal spice, toffee. Tasty and balanced, no off notes at all but it feels a bit thin.

**Finish:** Tame hot cherry and minty spice

*****

1 is really nice, it's sweet and mellow but with full flavor and just enough spice and heat to make it interesting. 2 is also good. The nose is fantastic, it's sweet with really nice chocolate mint notes. But unfortunately 2 tastes a little washed out and thin. So 1 is the clear winner for me here. It's brighter, more lively, the nose and taste jump out at you. It's actually somewhat tame for a FRPS, but it's positively fierce next to 2 which is just kind of boring. Going by similar previous experiences, I'd guess 1(my fave) is the 9yr, and 2(boring) is the 12yr.

**Reveal:**

Sample 1: >!OBSF 9yr/7mo 55.4% South Carolina!<

I have overwhelmingly found FRPS's in the 11-12yr range to be boring and underwhelming, I was hoping this one would be different. I mean it's not a bad Bourbon, but it's just not what I look for in these. A lot of people lament the dwindling ages of these, maybe the older 12yr bottlings were better but in my experience FRPS's seem to do much better in the 8-10yr range. I think the low proof doesn't help, these are better when they're hot and lively imo.

*****

**Teaninich 11, ex-Islay hogshead 57.5%, Chorlton Whisky (done blind)**

**Nose:** In case the healthy straw color wasn't enough of a clue, the nose confirms it: It's a Scotch. Beautiful smooth rich cereal malt, light sweet caramel, balanced floral sweetness, vanilla, then super clean chocolatey smoke builds with black liquorice and light zingy medicinal menthol, light earthiness.

**Taste:** I'm pretty sure this is a peated Scotch now, but it's an amazingly clean and sharp smoke that doesn't immediately announce itself or intrude on the rich cereal malt. Really interesting. Caramel, clean smooth chocolatey peat, balanced floral sweetness, smooth rich cereal malt, vanilla char and peat, menthol, fruity malt

**Finish:** The peat comes in stronger on the finish with toffee, smoke, smooth chocolatey char, sweet fruity malt.

* The peat snuk up on me here. At first it feels like a really nice malty refill Bourbon barrel, then the clean rich smoke creeps in and builds, and before I knew it I was drinking a peated Scotch. It has some ""mean peat"" and medicinal quality to it even tho it is pretty soft and smooth, so maybe it's something with some age on it that has tamed the peat somewhat. Or a non Islay peat like Ardmore or Ledaig. I like it a lot.

*****

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** u/playingwithfire decided to mess with me on the reveal and told me that this wasn't an Islay or even a peated malt. My heart sank, I've certainly embarrassed myself on blind tastings but not that bad lol. I was so thankful when he revealed that it was a Scotch aged in an ex-Islay barrel lol. That totally explained the odd peat character this had. It wasn't so much a soft peat, it was more of a strong mean Islay peat, but done softly if that makes sense. And so much delicious cereal malt, it worked really well together. What a unique and interesting blind sample, one of the coolest mysteries I've ever had. Also this is my first Teaninich, and the first I've ever heard of the Chorlton bottler. I'm impressed on both counts.

Teaninich is a sleeper. Tasty distillate that ages well in a good ex-bourbon cask. Nice review.
I've had /u/playingwithfire mess with my mind like that before haha. I'll have to repay the favor very soon.

This sounds awesome, I can imagine a peaty Teaninich as being somewhat close to an Ardmore with the maltiness.
The guy who runs it is a really friendly sort. He does loads of local tastings and you can tell he has the knowledge to make the whisky work.
I was reading that it's Diageao's 3rd largest distillery, that's mind blowing considering how little you hear of it. The malty side of this stuff was super impressive, I'd like to try more.
It didn't really taste like an Ardmore, the peat was just...off somehow. Not bad, just had a quality I couldn't pin down. So non-Islay peat like Ardmore or old tamed Islay was all I could think of. It actually tasted more like Laphroaig, but the way the peat was strong and yet in the background with a lot of malt was just off. Now I know why, but at the time a malty Scotch aged in an Islay barrel just didn't occur to me.

And yeah, he really scared me for a second there haha
I wasnt not aware of that -- saw on their wiki page that it mainly gets blended into red label, what a waste."

**Clynelish Reserve, Game of Thrones ""House Tyrell,"" 51.2%**

**Nose:** Rich thick caramel, buttery malt, balanced and thick, smooth fruits, vanilla, raisin and light spice. Plenty of malt and smooth fruits that combine thickly, it's all very ""Scotchy.""

**Taste:** Much like the nose, it's thick and balanced. Warm rich caramel and malty Scotch goodness, vanilla icing, warm fruits, gentle spice heat on the end. It's very straightforward and simple, like the nose it's just super ""Scotchy"" with no frills or surprises but extremely well executed.

**Finish:** Still no surprises here! Sweet rich malty Scotch, thick caramel, warm easy fruits, chewy malt

*****

A beautiful Scotch. I'm not sure of the makeup but I swear it's lightly sherried, it has so much smooth warm fruits to it. Raisins and cherry and mango but not in a wine-y way, more of a smooth and warm fruitiness that melds and intertwines with the thick caramel malt beautifully. A bit simple but very well executed and enjoyable, super Scotchy. It's really nice stuff at the $60ish MSRP

Hey Mr. Buckydean, nice review. I‚Äôve passed on picking this up multiple times but your review has sold me on getting one. It sounds really good. Cheers.
Looks like a Yorkshire rose
Thanks for the review! These GoT releases have been pretty severely panned, but the ones I'm still slightly interested in are this one (cask strength Clynelish? yes please), the Lagavulin and the Talisker. Can anyone comment on how this compares to the standard 14 yo Clynelish?
I must have missed this one. As the few GoT whiskies I tried were just awful. Mouthful of Peat and not much more. 

Cool review. You never know, this could end up being rare or something.
Mr. Dean Machine, have we not spoken repeatedly about the need for the monkey poster?

;) nice review.
Nice review, glad you enjoyed it! Definitely a good value at current pricing.
Yeah it's a really solid Scotch for MSRP. I know you're a big fan of Clynelish, I think you'll enjoy it.
I just picked up a bottle of the Talisker. It‚Äôs really pretty fantastic- a bit sweeter and rounder than the classic Talisker 10

**Taste:** Definitely barrel proof, tastes hot but not crazy. Maybe upper 50's ABV. Hot spicey zing, cinnamon red hot cherry, easy rich maple and caramel, sweet wood and fun floral notes. It still tastes really familiar.

Review #157: Laphroaig Cairdeas 2015 200th Anniversary,,https://i.redd.it/r0usqw3smz551.jpg,"This was a very interesting Cairdeas that they bottled in 2015 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the distillery. Instead of some kind of wine finish or barrel shenanigans they simply made a straightforward Bourbon barrel Laphroaig, but as pure and old-school as they possibly could. Unlike other Laphroaigs it is made 100% from their own floor maltings that use a cold smoke technique for the peat, then it was distilled in their smallest pot stills that are similar to what they used over 100 years ago and aged in their oldest warehouse right next to the sea. There is no official age statement, but iirc the Master Distiller said in an interview that it is just shy of 12 years old.

Courtesy of u/toadpooh

*****

**Laphroaig Cairdeas 2015, 200th Anniversary 51.5%**

**Nose:** Huge and super clean Laphroaig medicinal peat, crisp brine, caramel and sweet vanilla, black liquorice, crisp menthol char, toasted wood. It's epicly huge but at the same time it is so sharp and clean. 

**Taste:** Typical huge Laphroaig medicinal peat but it is so crisp and clean. rich caramel, clean brine, sweet vanilla, milk chocolate, huge clean peat, black liquorice char, delicious toasted wood, crisp menthol. It's like a laser focused Laphroaig, the notes are complex and nimble and clear but with tons of clean medicinal peat. It's almost like a bright and happy Laphroaig, if that makes sense. But without sacrificing any of it's impossibly huge peat monster character. 

**Finish:** Mild spice then sweet vanilla, clean medicinal peat and sweet char that lingers for ages. It's a sweet peat kind of finish, not the down and dirty peaty char of other Laphroaigs. 

*****

What an amazing Laphroaig. I love it but I haven't had this since back in 2015/2016 when it was released, and my opinion on it may have changed a bit. At the time this was the end all of Laphroaig to me, the best expression from the distillery I had ever tasted. And while I still love it every bit as much as I did back then, I think my tastes are a little more refined and I can appreciate this more as just a different kind of Laphroaig. This is a clean and complex Frog, happy and bright but still a peaty and medicinal beast. But I still love the more heavy and bludgeoning feel of the 10yr cask strength with its darker charred and vanilla flavors. But there is no Frog like this one, that's for sure. Two things I still stand by is that (1)Bourbon barrel Laphroaig is BEST Laphroaig and (2)This is my favorite Cairdeas.

I am with you on this being the best cairdeas. The 2019 got a lot of good reviews but to me was not as good as this.
Thanks for the review, sounds like a fantastic expression from the distillery!

I've always maintained that modern Laphroaig just plays so much nicer with bourbon casks. Something about the citrus flavours in the bourbons cask that match the tropical fruit notes of the Laphroaig new-make so incredibly well.

Not sure what happened but old school Laphroaig (60s-80s) was phenomenal in sherry casks but modern Laphroaig needs a bourbon barrel.
Respect. Easily the best Cairdeas. Made with 100% Laphroaig floor malted barley; all run through their #1 still...11 years old.  Truly unique Laphroaig and made with love.  Love it.
Yes, great year for Cairdeas. I bought 4 bottles, and still have two of them. Not sure what I'm waiting for before I open them, but I still have a couple of boxes of other stuff to go through before I get to this again.
Great review, the distilling process was great fun to read as well!
This sounds amazing, thanks for sharing. Maybe this ‚Äúback to basics‚Äù approach can become a trend one day, like barrel finishes are these days.
What a great review. >Its almost like a bright and happy Laphroaig. 
Haha, well said.
If I can find this, what is a reasonable price to pay?
This was my favourite Cairdeas until I tried the 2013 port wood. What did you think of that one?
Glad you enjoyed it. The peat certainly is unique - more coal or soot.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.  *Laser focused*. I would say sharply etched flavors.  I tasted it two years ago, loved it, and now have a bottle waiting to be opened.  If it were gone, I would immediately buy a replacement [Edit:  Oops, it seems to have become rare].  Glad to see a traditional way of making scotch still works so well.
Wow nice review! You know, I seem to remember this not being very well received back in 2015. I haven‚Äôt had this one, but it sounds really good! Why did this have such a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù reception when it was released, I wonder?
Great review.

I think the forethought that went into creating this whisky for their 200th anniversary is really phenomenal.  Not many businesses are looking 12 years into their  future, even if it is for a small batch release like this.
Nice review. This is the best Cairdeas by a mile IMO.

And using 100% floor malted barley, along with the older stills and warehouse, is so much more interesting as a selling point than just going with a different wine cask maturation every year. Not that those can't be good, but this one feels much more special than the others.
Fantastic review - thanks for sharing! Shame I never got a chance to try this one - sounds right up my alley!
2018 and 2019 were both really good, 2018 might be my favorite sherried Laphroaig. But like I said, Bourbon barrel Frog=BEST Frog so even though they are just a different style, they don't come close to 2015 for me personally.
Same.
Exactly how I feel, it's made with love and it shows
Its definitely something I'd love to see more of, so I hope so. Happy cake day!
Thanks! It kind of slowly dawned on me, because it's still a peat monster so it's not the first description that comes to mind. But for a Laphroaig it is kind of bright and happy.
I don't follow secondary or auction stuff, so I really don't know what this is going for. I think last I saw several years ago, the 2013 Portwood was going for $200-$300 and that one was more popular than this. But I personally wouldn't pay that
The 2013 was an awesome and really unique Laphroaig. I loved it, but not as much as many other people do. The 2013 is a fan favorite and considered by many to be the best Cairdeas release. To me it was maybe a bit too one dimensional, the Port is super rich and creates a wall of rich sweet fruit and peaty flavor. I prefer these Bourbon barrel Laphroaigs personally.
Yeah I like that haha, sharply etched flavors is a good way to put it as well. Its complex, all the different notes are very strong and clear on their own but still work together well.
>I seem to remember this not being very well received back in 2015

That's not how it went for me at the time haha. I instantly loved this as my favorite Laphroaig, I went through a few bottles and bought 2 more to bunker. 

If it wasn't big for others maybe it's just because people seem to go crazier for wine finishes, and the 2013 portwood which was a fan favorite was still fresh in peoples minds. Not sure
This was my thought as well. Did they do all this in anticipation of the 200th anniversary with plans to release it like this? Or is it possible that they always have some barrels aging of this 100% floor malting ""small batch"" style Laphroaig, as a profile they like for blending into batches. I believe standard laphroaig contains 20% of their own floor maltings, so maybe producing this type of Laphroag is their standard way of blending it in for all we know.
Look who came out to comment! I'm honored my review brought you out of Reddit purgatory haha. I had a question in another reply here, I'd be interested in your thoughts:

Did they make this 12 years ahead of time in anticipation of the 200th anniversary with plans to release it like this? Or is it possible that they always have some barrels aging of this 100% floor malting ""small batch"" style Laphroaig, as a profile they like for blending into batches? I believe standard laphroaig contains 20% of their own floor maltings, so maybe producing this type of small batch Laphroag is their standard way of blending it in for all we know.
Cheers!
Yea, I remember this one. Clean and crisp yet pure Laphroaig. It's really hard to beat a nicely bourbon cask aged whisky, especially a Laphroaig.  Like others have said, "" back to basics"". All said, I am looking forward to the 2020 cairdeas as well.
The 2013 still being so fresh is probably why. I love the Cairdeas wine finishes. The 2018 Fino has been my favorite. I should ‚Äúbunker‚Äù some! Lol
That's a good question, I don't know 100%, but I'm almost certain it would be the latter.

I wouldn't expect them to mix the floor malted barley with the malt they order in. They order it at a specific PPM after all and I'd think their floor malting would be much more variable in that regard*, not to mention the fact that their own maltings would be more valuable. They must be used in separate batches, and I know they keep track of all the details of how each barrel was distilled because when I was there they mentioned using that data when they have sub-par or way off-profile batches. They can even check who was on staff at each position the day a specific batch was distilled. 

I'm sure the 80:20 ratio(which I believe is more like 75:25 or even 70:30 now, as both Laphroaig and Bowmore have been trying to increase the amount of floor malted barley they use) comes into play during vatting. So I'd expect them to have more barrels of 100% floor malted distillate from the older stills maturing in that same warehouse. 

By the way, [here's](http://www.whiskyfun.com/archivefebruary15-2-Ardbeg-Laphroaig-Port-Ellen-Bowmore-Jura-Bunnahabhain.html#170215) a review from Serge of a blend of two barrels of 100% floor malted Laphroaig distilled in 2003 and pulled in 2015, that were about to be used in a ""special bottling"". That pretty much confirms that it contains some ~12yo juice.

*The big maltings like Port Ellen and Glen Ord just peat up to something crazy like 170PPM and then blend it down with unpeated barley to get to whatever PPM was ordered, so it's always exact. Whereas I believe Laphroaig and Bowmore actually kiln all their floor malted barley to the level they need. I could be wrong about that though.
I'm always looking forward to the next Cairdeas, but yeah this one a little moreso than usual for sure.
That was basically my thought as well, just not nearly as detailed or informed as yours is haha. I wouldn't think they would go to all the trouble of meticulously doing their own floor malting and peating just to mix it with all the Port Ellen maltings. And if this was some special batch that they planned ahead of time for the 200th anniversary they probably could have done better than an 11yr NAS. Regardless, I'm really glad they decided to bottle some for this 2015 Cairdeas, it's very special.

You always have very informative and interesting replies, thank you!"
Review #156: Ardbeg Blaaack Committee Release 50.7%,,https://i.redd.it/u6jhbja8pk551.jpg,"This is the 2020 ""Ardbeg Day"" special release, it's finished in New Zealand Pinot Noir casks. Courtesy of #Dilettante

*****

**Ardbeg Blaaack Committee Release, 50.7%**

**Nose:** A mean powerful phenolic peat but feels softened for an Ardbeg, clean heavy brine, chocolate, root beer char, faint red wine sweetness, red fruits, vanilla

**Taste:** Smooth buttery mouthfeel with building heavy phenolic peat, chocolate, toffee, sweet vanilla and barrel notes, a light candy fruit sweetness but not a whole lot of wine influence, mild char. Proper heavy Ardbeg peat but still a bit tame and smooth for having a name like Blaaack, although maybe not too surprising given the ABV

**Finish:** A mild zing of red wine and spice, sweet vanilla, soft chocolatey phenolic peat

*****

For having a name like ""Blaaack"" this is very soft and smooth, but maybe it's not surprising given the low ABV. Wine influence is minimal compared to something like Longrow Red Pinot Noir, there's actually a lot more sweetness in the vanilla and chocolatey barrel notes to me than any kind of wine sweetness. It's not bad, but it just feels a bit too tame for my tastes and not special enough to be any kind of ""big deal"" special release imo. I probably wouldn't even be inclined to buy this in the $100 range, much less the $150+ it goes for. Still a solid Ardbeg peat monster.

Thanks for the review! I have to say I‚Äôm always slightly relieved when I hear that these special releases aren‚Äôt much better than the core range. Helps with my fear of losing out and saves my pocket book. Although I did spring for an Ardbeg Drum for $109. At that price at least it wasn‚Äôt sooo much more than a Corry or Uigeadail.

Edit: oh and I love the Longrow Red 11 yo Pinot Noir!
I tried this for the first time last night. I agree with your review. I might give it another point, but overall it is spot on. I think, after the second tasting, the word ""balanced"" started popping into my mind. This is a very well balanced peat monster. (I know, I know. But I love peat monsters.)  
If I can get it on sale, it would be a welcome addition to my collection.
[removed]
Did we not just have a whole conversation about the monkey poster!? **We have expectations, man!** 

:) nice review buddy. I‚Äôm seeing the standard release of this all over now. Have you had it? I‚Äôm wondering how it compares to the standard Blaaack.
Nice review.  From what I've seen this is the best of the recent releases, but not on the level of the Twentysomething.  Those I can get if I could get over the price...

This  has sounded like something I would enjoy from the start, but I don't  think I'm going to see it.  I think my state's distributor dropped the  ball on the non-CR.  I've been keeping an eye out for it for months  (either version) and seen nothing.  I know some CRs came in, but they  were so limited that they were all spoken for before they ever touched  the shelf.  I talked to the owner of my favorite shop and he said that  they got all they were going to get and he hasn't seen anything about  the non-CR from the distributor.  Aaaaaaaarg!
Great review, thanks for sharing!
How do you like the drum? 

I've only had a couple of these Ardbeg special releases and they don't impress me a whole lot for the price. I don't always love Cairdeas either, but for the price I feel better taking the risk on those. I would pry buy these Ardbeg's in the $80-$100 range.
You wont find this on sale, these committee release bottlings get snatched up quick even at full price. But I wouldn't worry about it, I think uigeadal and corryvreckan are better scotches for the price
I know, I know! It's not what you want to hear, but I think for 2oz sample reviews I'm going to start using a stock image of the bottle like this. It seems more helpful and informative to let people see what the bottle and label looks like. But dont worry, the monkey will still be appearing with my bottle reviews!
It just arrived in the mail so I haven‚Äôt cracked it open. It‚Äôll be this weekend or next most likely. I‚Äôd try a lot more of the Ardbeg special releases if they were in that price range but they‚Äôre usually so much higher. Everything Laphroaig does is so reasonably priced, so I‚Äôm happy to snap up any edition of Cairdeas I can find. Of course actually Ardbeg‚Äôs core range is also very reasonably priced (especially if one can still find Uigeadail and Corry for $60-70) so I can‚Äôt complain.
I feel the same way. I had an opportunity to buy this at $140, but I passed after a sample. It was good, but it wasn't $140 good. That's the same price at the Lagavulin 12 or the SCN Ledaig 13, and it didn't stand up to those. I have a bottle of the Supernova 2019 open right now and I would say it tastes more like a $100 whisky than a $180 whisky. Others have said it, but the problem with Ardbeg is that the core range is so good and reasonably priced that the special releases feel silly to spend on. The special releases are rarer, but not necessarily better.
That‚Äôs good to know about Cairdeas. Have you tried this years release? I just became a FOL and wanted to try it out.
The drum has a little more to it than the black does but it is also sweeter since it‚Äôs finished in rum casks. I personally think the blaaaack and drum are on the milder side, but it does it for me.
So I just cracked open the drum today and did a blind tasting from 4 bottles. It turns out I liked the Drum about as much as the Wee Beastie. I got the drum for $109 and Wee Beastie is $45 here. Talking to my wife about this, she said ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs more expensive to do these special releases, so they‚Äôre priced higher but they‚Äôre not any better.‚Äù That made so much sense to me. I have no idea if it‚Äôs true or not. But I think consumer psychology is to think because something‚Äôs more expensive it‚Äôs going to be better. With Ardbeg that isn‚Äôt true. Frankly, I‚Äôm glad for that, because I love their core range and I love how it‚Äôs priced!

Edit: oh and ‚Äúabout the same as Wee Beastie‚Äù means I liked it slightly less than Ardbeg 10 and considerably less than Oogie or Corry.
You nailed it, I 100% agree. Those 2 bottles are good comparisons as bottles that are similarly priced or lower and are actually worth the money
>Others have said it, but the problem with Ardbeg is that the core range is so good and reasonably priced that the special releases feel silly to spend on. The special releases are rarer, but not necessarily better.

That's my issue with the Twentysomething at $599.  There are some really good options at a lower price point including Laphroaig's 25.  I'd say Ardbeg's pricing strategy is working because people are buying, but I still see lots of previous non-CR Ardbeg day releases on the shelves.
No, cairdeas hasn't made it to the U.S. yet where I'm at. But I'll be grabbing it first chance I get. I don't think signing up for the FOL helps you get it any easier or quicker, not that I know of anyway. AFAIK you still have ti find it on a shelf like everyone else.
Well I had *Kelpie and that was ""on the milder side"" too. If all these Ardbeg LE's are just mild Ardbeg, they really aren't for me
Thanks‚Äîyour review of the Ledaig helped convince me to pick it up!
 Same here but it looks like you can order it online already from their site, it‚Äôll just take around 5 weeks to ship out (from what I can see at least not entirely sure). Also online it says it‚Äôs a FOL exclusive, but if you can get in store that‚Äôs even better for me because I don‚Äôt think I can get alcohol shipped to where I am. That‚Äôs good to know so thanks üëç
The Dark Cove is the only other one I have and I would say it‚Äôs also mellow."

**Nose:** Medicinal Laphroaig peat, smooth and clean but still powerful. Buttery and smooth, caramel, sea brine, strong vanilla. A very typical Laphroaig nose, just a tad softer and more buttery.

**Taste:** Fucking yum. Like the nose it's a very typical peat monster Laphroaig but buttery and smooth. Huge clean medicinal peat, caramel, there's boggy sea brine and tar but again it's very clean, menthol, buttery wood, tons of sweet creamy vanilla. Super drinkable

**Finish:** Ashy charred peat builds huge, darkens into chocolate, ashy char, black liquorice, menthol. It's a really nice charred peat send-off

A legit and delicious Laphroaig. The age has smoothed out the edges just a little but without sacrificing the intense peaty character. Everything you could want in a Laphroaig but with a very balanced(for a Laphroaig) and clean presentation. I remember feeling similarly about the 2015 Cairdeas, it would be interesting to drink this alongside that one. I don't have any 10CS on hand but my impression is that the 10CS is a bit boggier and dirtier(in a good way) and charred than this, more intense. This is beautiful, god I love Laphroaig

Really glad I managed to grab a bottle of this when it went on closeout locally. The MRSP was ridiculous, but it was much better by the time I got to it.
Sounds like an amazing Laphroaig. Have you had any other First Editions bottlings?
How much did you pay?
Looks like $140. It got further discounted down to $79, but I don‚Äôt think there were many bottles if any left by then.
Wow, $140 is a great price and $79 is just bonkers. You're up in Oregon right? Was that at the OLCC? Actually now that I think about it my friend I got this from is up in Oregon so maybe
Yup, that was the OLCC. They bought a big lot of First Editions bottles in the early-2010s that turned into shelf turds and they‚Äôve been periodically putting them on closeout over the last few years.
Wow, what a shelf turd lol
It was originally $254, so yeah, not many people going for it then."

Cheers buddy!
What happens in 4 years?
A friend got me some bottles from Belgium a few years ago, and it was the first time I tried it. I had one when I first got them and it was fucking fantastic. The rest I decided to age, and this is the first aged one I've dipped into. The ""best on/after"" date on the cap is coming up in November. Honestly I can't really speak to how much aging has helped. It's still fantastic, but I don't really notice it being dramatically better than the one I had 1.5 years ago. I have 4 more aging that I'll bring along to my families house on Christmas to share with my drinking buddy cousins. I'm too worried about over aging them, they're good now so fuck it.

They are chocolatey and nutty and have a creamy quality. Has all the richness of other Trappist ales I've had but doesn't feel as heavy as others sometimes do. Honestly though sometimes I like that heavy, boozy feeling in other Trappists so to me a flat statement like ""best beer in the world"" is kind of silly. It boils down more to preference or mood. I will say though that I've never had another Trappist with the rich yet drinkable creamy quality of this stuff in the states.
Oh I did! I have 4 more, I might bring them along on christmas to enjoy with my family, if covid let's us have a Christmas this year
Ps6 and maybe a new gta
Awesome! Glad you liked and have some left.

If you've kept it in decent cellar conditions, it will last well past the cap date.

I opened one late last year that was 5 1/2 years past the date, so 8.5 years old, and it was amazing.

Still have some with cap dates of '14, '15 and '16, which I'm looking forward to. Think I have 12 or 13 in total. Might have to track down some fresher examples to do a comparison tasting. 

Cheers and stay safe.
Let‚Äôs hope buddy, take care man.
Oh gotcha. I've always been a generation or two behind on consoles, so I'm actually on ps3 right now on my very first playthrough haha. Its hella fun. But this news lately has me wondering if it will be time to get a ps4 once the 5 comes out
That's what worries me, I don't have ideal cellar conditions. I just keep them in my back bedroom in an insulted box packed with bubble wrap to protect against major temp fluctuations. My house varies from about 60-65 in the winter to 75-80 in the summer, although my back room seems to stay a bit cooler. I've often wondered if it would be better to just age them in the fridge.

How do you keep yours?
Yeah the ‚Äúno new gta‚Äù memes are strong on reddit today
It sounds as though you have done a pretty good job of storage, especially from what you said about the one you just opened. 

If I was you, having four, I'd take two to share and keep the other 2 for a while. Your choice. 

Most of my stuff is stored under the stairs in the house, boxed up and somewhat insulated. It's a relatively constant temperature under there. All in all, probably not too dissimilar to you, not perfect, but certainly not the worst. 

I've drunk so pretty old stuff that has been stored like that for 10-15 years and they seem to have aged exceptionally well. Sounds like you have done alright too. 

I'm not 100% sold of fridge storage for the long term, even for crown seal. Worried about condensation and potential for rust. I don't have any real reason other than seeing rusted caps coming out of the back of old fridges. I might see if I can find out any information on long term fridge storage and crown seals. 

Most of my beers are cork and cage (lambics) which are unsuitable for fridge storage. 

I looked into professional wine storage places, but it was going to cost too much and eat into my beer budget. It was funny talking to wine people about long term storage (20-30 years) for beer, they couldn't get their head around it. 

Good luck."

**Glenfarclas 2007 ""Marriage of Casks,"" The Whisky Exchange exclusive 51.1%**

**Nose:** Thick, warm, darkly sweet. Rich luxurious sherry, warm grape sweetness, thick chocolate, dark strawberry, prunes, dark charred wood. A sherry bomb for sure, soft yet thick nose with tons of decadent dark fruits and chocolate

**Taste:** Warm fruity sherry, dark fruity sweetness, thick grape, warm Scotchy malt, toffee, chocolate covered strawberry, prunes, dark toasted wood, a light kind of char in the background, mild friendly spice. It feels like the low ABV is just right, it's a nice balance of luxurious Scotchy sherry and drinkability, a total dessert Scotch. It's a darker sherry bomb for sure, but it doesn't feel ""heavy"" or hot at all.

**Finish:** Sweet candied fruits and spice, dark caramel, a light black liquorice char on the end. A bit short but utterly enjoyable.

I'm not the biggest fan of sherry, I'm very picky with the stuff. And I've had bad luck with overly hot, wine-y, spicy, or funky sherry bombs lately. Going with a low proof 'Farclas (that was vouched for by TWE) was my attempt to take things back to ""sherry basics,"" and boy did it work out well. It's dark and luxurious but in a warm and friendly kind of way. Exactly what I look for in a sherry bomb. God bless Glenfarclas for doing things right

> I'm not the biggest fan of sherry, I'm very picky with the stuff. And I've had bad luck with overly hot, wine-y, spicy, or funky sherry bombs lately.

This is why I took a break from ""sherry bombs"" for a while, because right now it's extremely difficult to find a sherried malt that isn't like this for under $150-200.

I was actually kind of surprised to see that this bottling is still available on TWE!  Any new release on TWE that has a dark color sells out within hours or even minutes, regardless of price or distillery, but yet this sub-$100 quality sherried malt remains available year after year.  It's kind of a sad statement about many buyers' decision making processes right now.
Very well put. It didn't click for me until I was writing out the stats for this review that it was bottled in 2016. It really is surprising that it's still available. In my mind, farclas is an ""old reliable"" when it comes to sherried scotch. It's fun to experiment with with some crazy bottlings out there but when I was getting hurt a lot it was time to return home to this stalwart. Maybe it's just not a very sexy bottling to people. Maybe everyone's looking for that next great IB or the smaller distilleries that are just starting to make a bigger name for themselves? And stuff like glendronach and macallan seem hotter. Maybe farclas' simple label design doesn't help, but I love it. Not sure what it is, but I hope they keep doing what they do"

**Nose:** Gritty, savory, thick. Minty toffee, vanilla, rich toasted wood, beautifully rich slow burn of deep Rye spice, gritty graham cracker, coffee, woody and minty char. This is an amazing nose.

**Taste:** Sweet and hot after the darkly toasted and gritty nose but it's delicious. Sweet candy notes of caramel, cherry, and vanilla. Big cinnamon heat, Rye spice, sweet charred wood, chocolate mint.

**Finish:** Lots of cinnamon spice, hot and tingly, sweet hot cherry, leaves with some vanilla and minty char once the heat dies down. Long and tingly-hot, in a good way.

*****

I enjoy it but I'm not gonna lie, I wish the whole Whiskey was as good as that nose. Nothing wrong with it though, it's another delicious 100% Rye from WP. And it's a lively one. Lots of bold hot cinnamon and fiery spice which is a little different for one of these in my experience. Usually they are more of a balanced Rye spice and mint thing, deep and brooding yet powerful. 

It amazes me the variety these have compared to something like FRPS. You expect to see variety in the Four Roses Single Barrels with all the different recipes, ages and proofs. But considering these are all the same 100% Rye recipe, all 10+ years old, and (almost) all in the 55-59% range, there is so much interesting variety to be found. I never get bored and I am rarely disappointed with these.

Is this Alberta?
I just tried regular whistlepig 10 last night at a bar. Definitely tasted like ginger ale, anyone else get that? It could have been the bar. It did have some strong food smells and that influences my palate a lot.
I have a bottle of the Potomac 57.9% unopened.  When I sampled it in their store, it was pretty intense.  But not as hot as your sample sounds.  Ah, well - water can be my friend if need be.  Thanks for giving us the full review - very detailed.
I don't know. I dont usually like to guess, but I dont think it's off profile enough to start thinking it's an MGP. But who knows. Maybe u/toadpooh can answer
I can see that. Rye can have some very sharp and unusual flavors like mint, evergreen, pine, dill, herbs, spice. And to me ginger ale is in that similar kind of area so I could see it coming across that way. And the standard 10yr isn't nearly as oaky to me as these single barrels get.

WP is a 100% Rye mashbill, so it has stronger Rye flavors than a lot of other stuff that only uses 51% Rye.
It wasn't a harsh kind of heat, just very spicey and a lot of cinnamon to me. I liked it, but I could see it not being what some people look for in these. 

These WP's can change a lot with time too, who knows what part of the bottle this sample came from. Hopefully it's a good journey when you open yours
Those notes sound both delicious and like MGP to me, minus a little dill. But I was just curious. Regardless thanks for sharing.
The back of the bottle should tell you the place of distillation. But WP has been known to mess this up (unclear whether intentionally or not).
Bottle was open for 1+ years, so it mellowed a bit. You got a pour from the last 1/4, so plenty of oxidation at work. I didn't get much, if any dill.

Back of bottle says ""Imported from Canada"" - so Alberta rye and not MGP?

(I tried posting a pic, but post seemed to stall).
Thanks for the reply. WP is really bad about proper labeling, even the MGP stuff uses the same ""imported from Canada"" label. The only way to know if it's Alberta or MGP is if the store who picked it knows, and then conveys that to the customers.
Yep, I've run into that and even had store owners who seemed confused after coming back from picking their barrels from WP.

Goddamn this is fantastic. I don't have much experience with Highland Park. In my earlier Scotch days I didn't care much for the 12 or 18, so I had written the distillery off ever since.

Wow this sounds really good! Thanks for sharing !! Sounds delicious :p
Really nice review.  Looks like an ex-bourbon hogshead release.  If so, look for Full Volume or any of the 1999 Signatory UCF hogshead releases.  They're so much different than the standard sherry cask releases and all hit the same notes you found here. I like HP in a sherry cask.  I love it in an ex-boubon cask. An absolutely beautiful whisky.
I liked this one, it's a lot smokier than the usual HP. Normally the heather honey predominates but with this one the smoke took over for me.
Mmm, I love these barley-forward Highland Parks. Great review!!
I'd wager Bourbon barrel. And yeah, standard Highland Park is good but was just always kind of a mess to me. I think another thing that threw me off was when they started releasing OB single barrels recently, they are crazy expensive and the reviews didnt seem very favorable. But after trying this I might start paying more attention to IB's. 

I dont know if it's a 99 but one of my stores does have an old Signatory UCF bottle I think for cheap.
>it's a lot smokier than the usual HP. 

Funny thing, I just never seemed to get any smoke from Highland Park. Everyone says the 12yr is a good smoky scotch but I never picked any up. Troyk said the same thing as you about this bottle, and I was really looking and I just didnt pick up much smoke except maybe on the finish a little.
Thanks! I feel like I need to get in on the HP game after trying this stuff. Are a lot of HP's generally this good? I'm told this is a pretty smoky one too, but I just never get much smoke from HP for some reason.
It's just a little more than I was used to with a HP. Taste: Brine, marshmallow, heather honey. Finish: peppery hearth smoke. I only had one sample and not a whole bottle so...
In my experience, the OB Highland Parks just aren't fantastic. There are some good ones, but all the best Highland Parks I've had (I've had a couple outstanding ones) have been single-casks or IBs.
I‚Äôve gone to a HP sponsored tasting and have been more impressed with IBs of HP than their standard line. One of my IB bottles is an intense ashy smoke bomb but also jammy and wonderful.
Same here, I just reviewed this off a 2oz sample
Oh yeah sorry, IB's are what I meant. I agree, I never cared much for OB Highland Park either that's why I've always steered clear. But I'm gonna have to check out some IB's now I think."
"Review #152: Glen Grant 22yr 1995 Cadenhead, refill sherry 57.2%",,https://i.redd.it/0ixp4ecyye351.jpg,"Courtesy of u/xreekinghavocx

*****

**Glen Grant 22yr 1995 Cadenhead's, refill sherry butt, 57.2%**

**Nose:** Malty, sharp floral citrus, sour berries, green apple, light musty wood, mild fruits and sherry wine funk. Basically nice and malty with light sherry fruits, although a little sour and funky.

**Taste:** Caramel, malt, smooth wood, bright berries, pears, sharp citrus, mild sherry funk, black liquorice, hot spice. It's pretty malty and clean, with just a subtle fruitiness. Spice builds hot on the end and into the finish.

**Finish:** After the relatively light nose and flavor it comes out swinging on the finish with some wild and hot flavors. Wood funk, big hot spice, chalky, strong dark black liquorice char that lingers nicely but a bit too hot.

*****

An interesting Scotch with some unique flavors. It mostly has a pretty malty and light character with some very mild sherry influence, but there's some sour/citrusy notes and dark/hot punchy flavors on the finish that are a bit odd, but it works well and gives it an interesting complexity. Not sure if that's from the sherry barrel or what lol. A fun Scotch that would make for an interesting pour now and then.

Just about two years and a week since I bought that bottle at the London Cadenhead shop. Did I get you a sample of the Linkwood 28 too? I forget
No, I don't think I ever tried that one from you. I definitely didn't get some from you when I got this Glen Grant. How was that one?
Ah okay. It was pretty similar to this but a couple notches above."

*****

**WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel, Hi-Time Wine #2664 ""Oinko Boinko,"" 58%**

**Nose:** Herbal and mellow, sticky-sweet caramel, strong sharp dill, evergreen, vanilla, sweet char, marshmallow and pastry. Funky yet mellow mix of herbal dill and sweet dessert

**Taste:** Sweet hot cherry kick, toasted wood, evergreen mouthfeel, hot minty spice, funky herbal dill, caramel, sweet char, vanilla. Sweet and tasty with a nice hot Rye kick

**Finish:** Action and heat on the finish. Toasted wood, hot zingy cherry, tons of strong Rye flavor with hot peppery spice, herbal dill, mouth-numbing menthol, vanilla. Descends into a dark sweet char

*****

This was a Single Barrel that definitely needed some time to grow on me. It was kind of one dimensional with overly prominent dill/herbal notes, but it has opened up into a wonderfully complex and balanced Rye. It's heavy on the herbal dill and spice notes with a nice little hot kick to it, it's certainly not one of those thick and creamy dessert barrels. But as a big Rye fan, the strong 100% Rye flavors are one of the things I really love about Whistle Pig. So it's another winner for me.

**Nose:** Clean woody Toffee, quite smoky with a strong yet gentle smokiness, floral zing, menthol, chocolate, sweet hazelnut, brine funk, musty oak, vanilla pastry, gentle herbal and minty spice. Crazy complex nose with some big funky notes but it all comes together in a very balanced way. 

**Taste:** Woody caramel, clean smoke, zingy spice heat, woody floral fragrance, light sweet char, tons of funky and earthy brine, sweet nuttiness, chocolatey/minty menthol like a york peppermint patty, vanilla, musty toasted wood. All kinds of crazy briny/smoky funk in here, very characteristic of a Glen Scotia in my experience. Barrel notes are smooth and on point. After 26 years it has all come together in that effortlessly complex and balanced way of a well aged Scotch

**Finish:** Mouth-numbing menthol and smoke, root beer char, vanilla, lightly burnt sugar sweetness. The menthol spice and sweet vanilla char rides out a long time with a very gentle smokiness.

*****

Really great stuff, it's a bit challenging but in a fun way. I love the weird briny funk and gentle smoke of Glen Scotia, it always combines in this odd dirty/earthy way like your palate doesn't quite know what to make of it. But I could definitely see it turning some people off. And the mouth-numbing menthol adds another level of weirdness to this stuff that I really love. The wood notes are smooth and balanced, not nearly as oaky as I would have thought for a quarter century in 1st fill Bourbon barrel. A great and interesting Dram.

First fill ex-bourbon might be my favorite cask for Scotia and this one sounds delightful.
I have a 12yr sherried Scotia, and its pretty weird so you may be onto something there. That briny dirty funk makes for an odd combination with sherry. I like it, but I have to be in the mood for it"

*****

**Loch Lomond Organic 17yr, 54.9**

**Nose:** Malty, with very strong Bourbon barrel influence. Woody caramel, strong Bourbon spice, creamy malt, tannic wood, banana, heavy vanilla pastry.

**Taste:** No surprises after the nose, malty and rich with a strong oak presence. Rich caramel and tannic wood, healthy spice kick, vanilla cream, nice barley sugar and pastry malt, mildly bitter wood, soft fruits. It's an interesting mix, the strong wood notes integrate nicely while stopping just short(barely) of being too oaky and bitter. But you definitely need to be in the mood for some wood to enjoy this

**Finish:** Spice rides out a long time with caramel, smooth toasted wood, malt

*****

A very oaky malt bomb. I've had oakier Scotches that were just a tannic mess, but not quite like this where it has picked up so much woody Bourbon flavor while basically keeping a balanced and Scotchy feel. It's almost like a Bourbon barrel version of a ""wet"" sherry barrel, where a decent amount of sherry gets left in the barrel and heavily flavors the Scotch. It was much more bitter and unpleasant when I first opened it, but after several months it has calmed down and more malty notes have emerged. Still something I have to be in the mood for.

Man I couldn't like this one. It was really bitter and it needed a drop of water just to take the edge off it. Plus the finish was so basic: Wood and caramel - but not like sweet caramel, more like burnt. For 17 years it surprised me. Felt like I was drinking a bad batch.
There is the monkey! All is right again. :)

Nice review!
This has basically been my experience with the scotch as well. But it's been open about 5 or 6 months and the bitter wood has calmed down. I haven't touched it in a while and I expected to rip it in this review, but I enjoyed it a little more this time.
Lol, glad you enjoy the monkey so much!
Life is good. Glad to see the monkey. Dude, you have to stay with what‚Äôs working. That said, that‚Äôs a professional review. Sounds like this dram was a tough nut to crack. Sounds really good though. Try the OB 18. Cheers!"
My friend found a complete set of signed Dune books at a library book sale,,https://i.redd.it/xzpyj2cl94151.jpg,"I think your friend wins ‚Äúfind of the year‚Äù award. This is killer
I like how he crossed out his own name.  I just imagine him shaking his head and saying ""No, no, it's not Frank Herbert.  It's Frank *Herbert!*""
Only Heretics and Chapterhouse are 1st editions, the rest are the old paperbacks but in good condition. So our theory is that back in the day somebody got into Dune somewhere between GEoD and Heretics, then bought 1st editions for the last two.

He only paid $3 total for all of them, $0.25 for the four paperbacks and $1 each for the two 1st editions
I can't be the online waiting for another topic in this sub being posted ""OMG MY SIGNIFICANT OTHER ACCIDENTALLY DONATED MY SIGNED COPIES OF DUNE TO THE LOCAL LIBRARY BOOK SALE""
Wow wow now that is something
This is incredible! So lucky! Very happy for him!
I got my first Dune paperback at a library sale years ago. It all started at the library for me. Long live the local libraries!
I love how Frank crossed out his printed name before signing.
I wonder what would happen if you found a version of Dune, with ""Frank Herbert"" striked like this, and below a real signature of ""Brian Herbert"".

Sorry for the concept, some on this sub will have nightmares !
Thank goodness they didn‚Äôt rip the covers off!
Daaaaaayummmmmm!!!
That is one awesome case of 'finding a hidden treasure'. So cool!
Goldmine!
So you want to wait untill the 2020 movie is released, this way those books will be worth even more than they currently are now (they are already worth LOT)
Woooow! :O
that‚Äôs a book i would not have returned and reported lost. Ooops
I want it so bad üò´
Dude that's lit I would def buy that lol be epic u should display it
Treasure them for us.
How do you know that‚Äôs really Frank Herbert‚Äôs real signature?
r/dune, I trust that you can make this the top post of the subreddit!
Man I'm so jealous - been looking for decent condition old paperbacks on the Internet and paying 20 bucks each. This dude gets em all signed and practicality free. Good for you man!
That is awesome!!!
I don‚Äôt mean to be a downer, but did you get these authenticated? If so my friend you and your friend have a gold mine
If they want to part with God Emperor, let me know, i will pay well.
Wow, I share the same last name and it surprises me how similar we sign it!
Many authenticators are basically just doing what you did, checking against known examples, albeit on a more exacting basis. 

Another tell is to look at the signature from the back of the page. A real pen will usually leave a indent, a printed example will be smooth.
Right? He said he only bought a few of them, and when he got home and realized they were signed he went back and found the the rest. The luck is incredible, and at that price
Yeah I love that too, he did that in all of them
From my understanding, most authors who sign books do that. I can‚Äôt remember why, perhaps a sign of authenticity. Every signed copy I have of other books has the author‚Äôs name crossed out
I recently purchased signed first editions of Heretics and Chapterhouse - for about $250 each. This is a great find!
First editions for GOES onward are still super cheap.

Ebay some Book club editions for the rest and you can have the whole series in first print for a steal
Oh fuck

I‚Äôd pay a lot more for those

Great find
Yeah, I cant help but wonder what the story is behind them. I figured somebody probably died, and a family member donated all their books to the library not knowing what they had. It's sad to me that we will never know, I wonder who this person was.
Me too, he collects books so this is right up his alley
Now THAT is some nightmare fuel.
I don't think he's interested in selling them, he collects books and loves having these. I'd sell them for sure though haha. I hate collecting books, they're so heavy and take up too much space. I'd rather borrow a book and then give it back when I'm done
We dont really know for sure unfortunately. He basically just googled Frank Herbert's signature and it looks about right. But hey reddit loves verifying and correcting things, so it's a good sign that nobody has come out with a ""actually..."" reply haha
Dr. Fun reporting in
No he hasn't got it authenticated. It is a concern obviously, he basically just googled frank herbert signatures and it looks right.
That's a good tip, thanks. I'll tell him for sure
I‚Äôll give him twice what he paid if he wants to sell them. *twice*
He probably did not like the font.
Oh wow, I didnt realize they were that valuable. Hope you are enjoying yours!
That's very possible.  I've a large collection of autographs and I specified them in my will (I'm only 36 but you never know) juuuuuuusssstttt in case, so my heirs know what there is.
The thrift store near me often accepts ""estate"" donations when people die. I have found some pretty great books there. The trick is you have to go often and check the new stuff first.
Dare I say his greatest find?
Ah i See, hopefully it‚Äôs the real deal
I have a signed paperback and after comparing, I think this is the real deal.
So, $6?
Counter offer, I'll give your friend thrice... THRICE I SAY!
That is a weird and specific assumption. You don‚Äôt think he was just being funny?
Although that is a cool font. Someone know if that is an actual font?
literally all the classic versions of all the books have that font, if the man didn‚Äôt like it why did he use it for 7 different books that he spent a few decades writing ?

This is also a comparison of two bottles currently available from K&L, but unlike the Cardinat and Jouanda they aren't exactly budget. $130 for the Domaine Freche and $150 for the Domaine Lous Pibous(still not bad though coming from the Whisk(e)y world).

*****

**Domaine Freche 1988 30yr, L'Encantada #17, 51.4%**

**Nose:** Vibrant and powerful fruits with tons of oak, sweet and rich, just WOW. Grape sweetness, bright tart berries, green apple, root beer char, tobacco, cherry cola, tons of rich toasted wood, smooth milk chocolate. A powerful and delicious nose, extremely complex, just amazing

**Taste:** Sweet and vibrant and bold, yet clean and very well rounded. Sweet berries and candy cherry, powerful clean toasted wood, deeply ingrained smooth wood spice, creamy sweet vanilla, dark caramel, tannic tobacco notes, cacao, root beer, tart sweetness. Like the nose it's just incredibly complex, my god it's such a pleasure.

**Finish:** Smooth wood spice and beautiful toasted oak builds big, vanilla, darkly bright sweet tart fruits, the spice fades and the candy sweetness lingers a long time.

*****

**Domaine Lous Pibous 1995 23yr, L'Encantada #146, 56.4%**

**Nose:** Soooo creamy and rich and woody. Smooth dark barrel notes, creamy toffee, chocolate, tons of vanilla, chocolate covered cherries, lots of dark tannic wood and spice. Just beautiful

**Taste:** Woody cherry syrup and hot lively spice hits huge with a dark hot sweetness, deep tart grape, thick thick thick sticky-sweet caramel, vanilla, rich smooth chocolate, tannic wood, vibrant spice. It's hot with a fair amount of spice kick, but it's a good heat and it's packed with huge flavor. It's like if Elijah Craig Barrel Proof and a grape had a baby

**Finish:** Vibrant hot spice that mellows into dark grape, complex wood notes, vanilla. The dark grape sweetness and delicious wood spice lingers for ages

*****

Wow, what a couple of stunners. These are both amazing. The Freche is the fruitier of the 2, it's more vibrant and sweet but still a rich oak bomb. I'm just amazed at how complex the fruit and oak notes are, and how well they play off each other. The Pibous is thick and creamy, with more spice and dark wood influence. It's more of the bruiser of the two. Both have the big and bold kind of flavor that I love in Armagnac, but I definitely prefer the fruitier and brighter notes of the Freche. Nothing against the Pibous at all though.

Ah yes, strategically priced just high enough to be out of reach for me. Maybe it will go on sale before they sell them all *nervous laughter*. Glad to see more reviews with both 'high end' and 'value end'. How does the 8 score you gave the Cardinat 2005 compare with the 8 from the Lous Pibous 1995? 'bout the same? High 8 vs. low 8?
Very nice reviews! These seem like winners.
>How does the 8 score you gave the Cardinat 2005 compare with the 8 from the Lous Pibous 1995?

Yeah that's a fair question haha. Scoring can be very subjective and difficult for me, and also I'm still fairly new to Armagnac so I think I'm just trying stuff and loving it and scoring it high. I think ""High 8 vs low 8"" is a fair interpretation of it. I would say the Pibous is certainly better than the Cardinat. But that Cardinat is fucking delicious, I highly recommend it. I can't imagine doing much better at that price.
Cool, you and a few endorsements from others sold me. If only I also knew if the three new bottlings just imported in on the east coast are any good (Domaine Le Basque 2002, Domaine de la Tuilerie 1982, Domaine de Jean Bon 2000).  Some other vintages seem to get mixed reviews, so will have to see.

Also the other thing that's going to kill me is not knowing if 1996 Darroze Domaine de Couzard-Lasalle is as good as Lous Pibous L'Encantada bottlings. Supposedly (according to K&L) it is from the same producer, just bottled by Darroze instead of L'Encantada. The way they price it seems to indicate so. But it has some availability at significantly lower prices in other stores. I managed to get a bottle of the Darroze bottling but have no way to compare. Now that Hail Yak II is gone because I sat on my hands too long, I may never know.
No just bottled by Darroze, raised by. So same spirit very different character. What we have is the last of his Couzard according to the importer. If you find 90s couzard for less than we‚Äôre charging definitely buy!!!
Thanks for the clarifying points. I wonder if its the last stock the importer has access too or the last of the stock capable of being sold at all. Entering into a world without the ability to buy anything from the Couzard-Lasalle estate would make me sad.
Oh, not good news there. The couzard estate stopped producing Armagnac in 2005. The vines are leased to a wine maker I believe. So there is a very finite quantity of this spirit in the world. It was always minuscule production-wise and split between the estate and Darroze, although I‚Äôm not sure in what proportions. I think the massive interest in LP has meant huge pressure on the Darroze stocks since people are figuring out they‚Äôre similar. I don‚Äôt know if Darroze is complete out of stock or just wanting to hold back the rest of the stock for later but it seems like we won‚Äôt be getting any more at this point. I‚Äôve got a Day Drinking with him tomorrow so I‚Äôll ask. There‚Äôs still a bunch of the younger vintages still in stock at the importer but they‚Äôre comparatively very expensive. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news...
Thanks for the info. I was a aware of the estate closing but I was not aware that you were meeting with Marc and could ask questions. Yeah, would definitely be interested in knowing whether or not some may still be available at some future date, even if that date is not known. If there's no more ever, it may make it even harder to open the bottle I do have : (.  

If you got time for more questions, ask him what the Pouteuo Armagnacs are like and how the 1999 and 2000 vintages compare. That's really all that's available to us on the east coast for a pretty good price right now from Darroze.
Pout√©ou is usually pretty intense. I love everything from around Lannemaignan. They‚Äôre distilling themselves and I think it‚Äôs a pretty big estate. I‚Äôll ask him what he thinks but generally he‚Äôs going to say it‚Äôs awesome! He‚Äôs very much a cheerleader for everything they‚Äôre bottling."
"Review #159: Larceny Single Barrel, K&L",,https://i.redd.it/fi8evna95m051.jpg,"u/RealRandallJohnson, this one's for you buddy
Larceny is a wheated bourbon from Heaven Hill distillery, with a mashbill of 68/20/12 corn/wheat/barley. This is a single barrel selected by K&L Wines, and it's one month shy of 8 years old

*****

**Larceny, K&L Single Barrel #6196278 , 46%**

**Nose:** Toffee and delicious creamy vanilla, musty wood, chocolate, candy corn, some minty spice. Rich smooth toasted wood notes with a nice kind of creamy chocolate/vanilla, but all in an easy kind of 46% way

**Taste:** Much more lively than the nose. Brash cinnamon spice and funky candy corn, sweet cherry, caramel, vanilla, creamy sweetness, toasted wood, sweet hot spice. A bit hot but it's a nice sweet heat, and the low proof keeps the harshness at bay while keeping the flavors full and balanced. It's a fun little sipper for sure.

**Finish:** Sweet cherry, mint, and bright tasty barrel spice that rides out a long time

*****

This is downright yummy, and does really well at 46%. Nice sweet flavor and moderate complexity, Has a nice little spice kick but the low proof keeps it under control I think and it all just works well. It never feels thin or watered down. You really couldn't ask for a whole lot more from a 92 proof Bourbon at under $30. It's been a long time since I had the standard Larceny bottling so I can't really offer any comparisons, but I don't remember liking it as much as this. Fuck I love WHEATERS

I find this stuff to be pretty darn tasty
I opened my bottle of this a couple of days ago. It's very unique to me. I picked up a lot of honey and orchard fruits on the nose. Very speyside-like.  
Palate is pretty standard Heaven hill to me.   
I've only had a couple pours though. Gotta get into it a bit more.
I have this bottle - it was my first wheater and I like it. makes great manhattans too
A store pick WHEATER? Sounds unbeatable
I have this bottle in my will call stash and was wondering how it was. Now I'm excited.
With the magnifico seal of approval, I may have to grab one of these.  You find the SiB picks to be noticeably better than the small batch?
I opened this a week ago and didn't care for it, it was kind of a mess. I just revisited it tonight and it's a world of difference, I'm enjoying it much more

**Finish:** Menthol and smooth caramel wood notes, sweet vanilla, slight char

*****

I swear at first the 10yr could have passed as Springbank for me, even though it's supposed to be unpeated I got tons of earthy and peaty funk. After a while it reminded me more of a Bruichladdich Laddie, malty and clean and sharp but with some really delicious and interesting funk thrown in. The 12yr is much richer and thicker but without sacrificing any complexity. Both delicious, but the 12yr wins the day for me.

I found similarly when I tried these two. I really like peat so it wasn't my cup of tea, but as you did I likened it to Bruichladdich offering nice flavor without the peat. I enjoyed the 12 year just a wee bit more than the 10, I assume because the cask influence just made it a bit more to my liking. Unfortunately I haven't been able to find any definitive evidence of different casks, but it may well be Sherried.
Good reviews, but ummmm where is the monkey portrait?
Nice reviews! Out of curiousity: if we take Springbank as a departing point, do you prefer the Longrow route or the Hazelburn route (in terms of flavour)?
I have talked to our local Cadenhead shop owner and he said that quite a few people get a tiny bit of peat from some hazelburn expressions.   
There's actually a reasonable explanation: They make Hazelburn right after the months they have made Longrow. So there's probably a tiny bit of Longrow left in the stills (etc.) that may (or may not) impart those flavours.  
Ooor it's all imagination ;)
I've seen quite a few of these posts with the smaller medicine bottle sized drinks. Can you please help me with where I can find this sized bottled scotches?
It didn't taste very sherried to me, it's a lot richer and much darker than the 10 year but that could just as easily be from more woody barrel influence. Just googling it a bit I saw a few mentions of it being sherried, but I don't know for sure.
12 Year should be all sherry casks, 10 Year should be all bourbon casks. But that may have changed over the years and there was always more batch variation in the 12 Year. The one I had a while back was overtly sherried, maybe even too much, whereas the sample of the 10 Year I tried seemed a little underdone.

Ah good Sir you beat me to it. So, where is that chursty monkey? Ummmm, good reviews.
Haha, I didn't realize the poster had fans that I would be disappointing! I just couldn't line up the shot for some reason, but I'll make sure to get it next time.
Asking the important question!
It's a little hard to say because these are my first hazelburns, and I have more experience with the other 2. Springbank is my favorite of the 3, and I would have to go with longrow as my other fave because I'm such a big fan of peat. I feel like I need to try some cask strength hazelburn though to really give it a fair shake
I definitely got a fair amount of peat and earthy funk from the 10yr, I easily could have mistaken it for a springbank at first. It calmed down and opened up with some air though.
These are 30ml samples from finedrams.com, it's on the bottle if you look closely at the picture. A lot of the other ones you see are 2oz boston rounds that we fill ourselves and trade with friends.
My gut reaction was that I liked it more due to the slightly increased wood influence which would have simulated the smokiness I like to a degree.
Not sure if you were drunk typing and meant ""thirsty,"" or if ""chursty"" is some fancy word that I don't know

And dont worry, the monkey will be back next time. Just thought I'd switch it up haha
Yes! When I see buckydean is the OP, I am accustomed to a certain accompanying monkey poster. **I don‚Äôt like change, man!**
Thank you so much!
Just having some fun. A friends father was Slovakian. That was his word for thirsty. It kind of stuck.
The Monkey may not be in the picture this time, but he will always be there in our hearts - source: another fan of The Monkey Poster."

**Nose:** Smooth and woody, caramel, tannic oak, light tobacco, chocolate, sweet vanilla, lightly fruity

**Taste:** Sweet candy cherry and spice, rich caramel, slightly tannic oak, musty wood, vanilla. It's sweet, simple and straightforward with sweet smooth wood notes

**Finish:** Bright floral spices, sweet caramel and vanilla. A little more action on the finish but it mostly stays sweet and floral

*****

A nice little Four Roses. Lightly cherry and floral with lots of nice sweet wood notes, and just enough spice and heat to keep it interesting. It never feels washed out or watered down, it's full flavored and enjoyable at the proof but super drinkable.

My first ever 4R store pick was a K&L OESO.  Great review!
Oeso is my favorite of all the nah bills from 4R. If I ever find another pick in going to snag it but haven't seen it in shelves for about 4 years
Two words: good shit!
Thanks. How long ago? Because this one is several years old, could be the same one
Yeah it's not a recipe you see around a lot, yet people dont seem to go gaga over it like the K recipes. Honestly I'd be hard pressed to pick a favorite recipe, I've had enough zingers and duds from each one.
It was a while (16 or 17) but mine was old - like 12 years, 1 month or so.  That was when I started to notice that a lot of OESO picks were older than most of the other recipes."

"Two barrels, consecutively filled on the same day in 2005, that spent 15 years aging right next to each other.",,https://i.redd.it/fuua2ex9adz41.jpg,"Very cool opportunity this presents in my opinion. Presumably any differences you pickup between the two would come down to the barrel influence given so many of the other production variables are the same (mash, distillation run, aging location, years matured, etc). Enjoy them!
Did you have them shipped? I‚Äôve been wanting to pick up a few things from k&l but was hoping to do will call.
Yeah, this was exactly my thought as well and I just couldn't resist the opportunity. I'm going to open them together to see how they compare. It's just too bad these aren't bottled at true barrel proof, I'd love to see how they ended up at different strengths.
Yeah, I always do shipping because I don't live near a K&L. I dont think they are doing will call pickup right now anyway, not even curbside. Just local delivery and shipping.
Yeah, I‚Äôve been waiting for will call to come back. But I may just have to bite the bullet on the local delivery."

**Four Roses Single Barrel Private Select, Merwins, OESQ 10yr 7mo 52.4%**

**Nose:** Robust and delicious nose, big gritty charred oak, perfumey cherry and fruits, tons of deep minty and peppery Rye, metallic caramel, brown sugar, chocolate oak notes, root beer char. Rich and oaky yet very lively, Really nice nose. 

**Taste:** Sweet candy cherry and caramel, big herbal Rye, floral perfumes, a mild spice zing, clean wood notes. Nice clean and vibrant flavors, super drinkable compared to some of the hotter and more action-packed high proofed picks.

**Finish:** Spice and herbal rye builds hot with sweet cherry, smooth chocolate wood and mellow char, leaves minty and a little bitter

*****

I don't usually care for lower proof FRPS's, but this one is nice. It has lots of familiar Four Roses flavor that is clean and vibrant, and it's all balanced out really nicely. I like the strong minty and herbal Rye character too. I think I still prefer the bigger more action-packed flavors of the higher proof barrels, but this is definitely one of the nicer low proof picks I've had.

Have OBSF and is a little off my flavor profile but still is absolutely delicious! I prefer a more fruity profile but this is up in my tops.
nice! I have a Total Wine pick of OESQ 10 yr 9 mo that‚Äôs 57.9% and it‚Äôs one of my favorite bottles
This sounds great, I love a low proof FRPS with a lot of herbal notes
I don't really have a ""favorite"" recipe, but OESQ might come close. I've had really good experiences with them.
Agreed. Towards the end of the sample I started thinking I may have even guessed this as a Rye blind. And then that made me wish Four Roses made a Rye.
This is my first private selection, can‚Äôt wait to try
more!

Review #19: Yellow Spot,,https://i.redd.it/lb5la8wm49y41.jpg,"I really like this whiskey.
Courtesy of u/orehnmadgib

*****

**Yellow Spot Irish Whisky, 46%**

**Nose:** Warm cereal malt, caramel, lemon zest, vanilla, pastry, mellow plum fruitiness and wine funk, green apple. Warm and inviting with nice malty character

**Taste:** Lemon citrus and barley, caramel, mild zingy spice, some mildly funky competing fruity wine flavors, wood funk. Has a nice viscous mouthfeel. Overall it's warm and pleasant with a nice little dose of friendly funk. The sweetness and wine isn't an overload, which I appreciate.

**Finish:** Caramel and barley sugar, sweet fruits, with lingering Irish ethanol

*****

It's a nice Whisky, not super exciting to me but plenty enjoyable. I like the malty base, and there seems to be as much grain sweetness as wine influence so it has a nice balanced feel. Definitely one of the better Irish Whiskies I've had. There's a weird kind of ethanol note I seem to always pick up in Irish Whisky a lot, it pops up here but it's pretty tame and seems to disappear with some air time.

I've never been a huge irish whisky fan, but I think I should give this one a try. Thanks for the review.
Judging by your username, I think you're just saying that as a fan of mine
What's your thoughts compared to green spot? I bought my first bottle of green spot last month and I'm in love with it. Makes me want to always have a bottle in my cabinet forever. But that doesn't mean of love yellow, which is pretty pricey.
Thank you for the review. How would you compare this to Green Spot? (If you've tried it?) I like Green Spot quite a bit.
Try the Redbreast 15
I‚Äôve never had the green spot, thought about buying a bottle. I picked up a bottle of yellow spot in Ireland as a souvenir coming home from Iraq and It‚Äôs a smooth whiskey.
Sure thing, thanks for reading.

I really liked green spot but it just drank too light imo at 40%. So I was hopefull that this yellow spot at 12 years and 46% would be the next best thing. But it wasn't as good as I had hoped based on how much I liked green spot.

I got to review green spot blind actually: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/99k1or/review_13_green_spot_irish_whiskey_done_blind/
How's it compare to the 12 cask strength?
Have you tried Knappogue Castle 14? It's very different. It's Irish whiskey alright l, but it's almost like dessert whiskey. I love it. The 12 is just like better Jameson though. It's good, but not very interesting. Haven't tried the 16.
I think all the Redbreast range are great value Irish pot still whiskies. All are fantastic!
I have tried one of them, but I can‚Äôt remember which‚ÄîI think the 12 or 14. It didn‚Äôt strike me as dessert and I didn‚Äôt quite gel with it; it struck me as a bit harsh but my palate was much more sensitive back then.
I've had Knappogues with the 1990s dates and their current 21.  Will try the 14 soon.  They're mostly single malt rather than single pot still.  Bushmills or Cooley distilled as I understand them.  They have a real delicacy to the casks in the 1990s bottles and despite that lightness and 40% abv were quite enjoyable.
Grab a bottle of the 14 for sure when you get the chance. I really only brought it up because Green Spot the closest whiskey I've had to it and it's really hard for me to get the 14 where I live. The 14 better, it has more body and is sweeter in a good way. Not that Green Spot is bad. I actually like it a lot. Sweets not normal my thing too.  

The 12 is thin which makes it kind of harsh. I have the same problem with regular Jameson it just has no body so the after taste always had this ethanol burn to it. At the same time it's short because it's thin so that's good I guess. Not really my thing.
Okay, you've convinced me! I'll pick up a bottle of the 14 and give it a try. I agree about regular Jameson -- not a fan for the same reasons you mentioned. My favorite Irish whisky thus far has been Green Spot Chateau Leoville Barton -- that stuff is amazing but I never see it in the US. The one bottle I got was actually when I was in Ireland and tasted it at the airport then brought it home. Second favorite is Red Breast.
I've had Red Breast 12 and the cask strength. Both are very nice. I haven't tried the other Green Spot you mentioned."
Help with bottle info and recommendations,"Thanks in advance, and I hope this is ok to post here!

I'm not super experienced with Mezcal, but I really like it. I've made due with a single bottle for quite a while now, Yuu Baal Joven Tepestate 48%. It's waning and I'm looking for more. Another one that I really liked was a Raicilla, [La Venenosa Puntas](https://www.oldtowntequila.com/la-venenosa-puntas-raicilla/). Other than those I couldn't tell you what I've had. I can say that I really enjoy the crisp, vibrant, bright side of Mezcal, lots of menthol, pine, mint, and crisp sharp flavors(I hope those notes make sense lol). I also prefer high ABV, preferably in the neighborhood of 50%+ but I could grudgingly do 46-48 if the quality is there. Any lower just feels watered down to me. A couple that I'm looking at that looks really interesting are these, if anyone has any info on the ABV of these I've seen varying accounts(maybe different batches/lots?): 

[Lalocura San Martinero](https://www.klwines.com/p/i?i=1367821)

[Real Minero ""Tobala""](https://www.klwines.com/p/i?i=1224499&searchId=a11ce3ae-36a0-4a95-8c8e-c0de5ffa8523&searchServiceName=klwines-prod-productsearch&searchRank=2)

I don't mind splurging a little since I'm not going to keep a whole lot around(Whisky and barrel aged stuff is my true passion), but if anyone has any recommendations in this price range or lower I'd be interested to hear it. I'm looking for something that ships in California, preferably K&L or Old Town Tequila. 

Thanks for any help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Mezcal/comments/gi1h2b/help_with_bottle_info_and_recommendations/,"Haven't tried those two but can't go wrong with those brands. This one is a higher ABV mezcal from a really good brand and available to you:

https://m.klwines.com/p/i?i=1341821
The Lalocura stuff will land around 49%, their neighbor Real Minero 50%. That's pretty normal for that town. Some Mezcalosfera bottlings seem to more often push towards that 55% upper legal limit, from the Miahuatlan area typically. Otherwise, try and somehow find more puntas, I guess. There's not many brands bottling them, especially for export.
Holy shit that looks good, might have a new contender. How common is wild harvested Agave in Mezcal?
Thanks for the info. I didnt realize that there was an upper limit in mezcal of 55%.

What exactly is puntas in mezcal? I see that word pop up from time to time. For example they might add the puntas to a mezcal. I see it means ""tip"" or ""heads"" (I assume the literal translation is point?).  Does that mean the heads of the distillation process, or is it another part of the plant?
I think most agaves are wild outside of espadin, but I'm no expert.

Edit: Apparently there are places where Tobala, Arroque√±o, Mexicano etc are being cultivated. So maybe not just espadin.
exactly that -- the heads of the distillation. Though what one mezcalero will call heads is not necessarily what another will. Where they make their cuts during distillation will vary from producer.
Many of the varrietals are facing extinction in the wild. So and increasing amount of responsible producers are switching towards cultivated agave, and starting their own nurseries etc.

Theese are often still plantes in exciting locations and given the age of the plant offers plenty of terroir.

If you want to guarantee the plant is wild, something like sotol(they reproduce before being harvested) or lesser known regions are probably a good bed."

But I find myself drinking it more and more, and with my bottles dwindling I ventured out to buy some on my own. I don't really know what I'm doing or know any of these names, and it seems like batches and Domaines are such small productions that reviews don't help a lot. So basically, I just looked for any place that proof(the higher the better), age and price seem to come together. Shopping at K&L I also made use of their extensive writeups to try and find the bold, fruity and woody profiles that I enjoy. These were 2 cheap bottles that fit all the criteria, so I took the chance. At $50 for the Cardinat and $60 for the Jouanda I had to try, and both of these are still available at K&L right now.

**Cardinat 2005 14yr Armagnac, 54%**

**Nose:** Bold and fruity, big luxurious tart berries and chocolate cherry, menthol undercurrent, smooth thick wood, chocolate, mellow even spice, vanilla, slightly tannic and woody. Beautiful nose

**Taste:** Bold berry fruits and warm grape, dark candy cherry, warm layers of zingy spice that build softly but strong and a bit hot. Orange citrus, chocolate, smooth beautifully toasted wood, vanilla. The flavors all meld nicely, its strong but smooth and balanced

**Finish:** Lots of layered toasted wood flavor and delicious spice with strong, smooth dark fruits. 

* This is my jam, exactly what I look for in an Armagnac. Bold, fruity, strong oak, nice spice zing. Extremely balanced and well executed but with big flavors that stop just short of being too ""punchy."" Coming at this whole Armagnac thing as a Whiskey lover, I love this kind of strong bold profile. This stuff has so much character, and it's so fucking delicious. And at $50, wow what an amazing deal.

Score: **8**

*****

**Jouanda 2004 15yr Armagnac, 49%**

**Nose:** Extremely delicate, it comes as a faint wisp of tart fruits, orange citrus, soft wood, light caramel, vanilla bean, some mild spice.

**Taste:** Delicate, but after airing out a bit it has some complexity and a nice velvety soft body to it. Orange citrus and warm tart fruits, green apple, fresh vanilla bean, clean soft toasted wood, washed out caramel, some mildly jarring anise that I kinda like.

**Finish:** Pastry dessert and vanilla bean, green apple, soft caramel, anise spice

* I didn't care for this bottle at first, it was kind of boring just because it was so delicate and light. I haven't completely changed my mind, but it is opening up and filling out after being open a while and I think I might be coming around. It's a good thing it was bottled at 49%, because it's so delicate and light that it would barely even exist at 40%. But the flavor that is there is nice, it doesn't feel too washed out or watered down. And it has a light complexity to it despite its soft character. I don't usually go for profiles like this so I don't think I'll be grabbing it too often, but it's not bad for what it is.

Oh hell yes! That Cardinat is fantastic. Absolutely one of my favorite $50 blind buys ever.

ISO that Cardinat! both bottles sound amazing. thanks for the review.
Nice review! I wish K&L still shipped out of state.  

If you want to learn more about Armagnac, there are lots of good resources out there to help with purchasing decisions. Like bourbon and scotch, there are many different factors that indicate the quality and style of what you are buying. Here's just a few factors and a couple of reading resources giving further details:  

- Region and soil type: Bas-Armagnac, T√©nar√®ze, Haut-Armagnac
- Grape type or blend: Ugni Blanc, Folle Blanche, Baco, and Colombard
- Chai type (barrel storage): Whether they age above ground in a dry chai or below ground in a damp cellar
- Company type: N√©gociant vs grower/distiller
- Aging practice: Some age purely in oak, some pull it out of oak when its 'done' and then suspend it in glass demi-johns for years
- Additives: whether or not they add anything to their products like bois√©, caramel, or sugar syrup (less than 2% allowed as per regulation)  
- Distilling practice: Do they distill themselves or use a traveling distiller (this one is kind of neat)

Wow thanks for all the info. I'm looking forward to digging in to all this on my break
Oh thanks, I dont think I knew about that one.
Yeah I wouldn't. I'm not as seasoned as some of you with Yak so maybe take my other score with a grain of salt, but I thought it was fantastic. My only other experience with a Yak this young was the Tariquet 15 that I think I tried from you, and I liked this one better.
Well thank you! üòä Honestly, I‚Äôm still learning about ‚ÄòYak at this point, but what I have become decent at is reading between the lines in K&L‚Äôs staff reviews. Thus far, I tend to like my brandies ‚Äúbold and fruity,‚Äù as you put it, so this one seemed right up my alley!
Yeah I don't just mean your opinion on Armagnac specifically, I just enjoy your thoughts and reviews usually over on the Whisky subs.

Omg I feel this so much, same here lol. Rule #1 for me is that if the name, quality and price seem too good to be true...then it is. Learned that one the hard way. A few times.

Totally! I‚Äôve learned that I definitely can‚Äôt blind-buy any of their single-cask Scotch picks - at least, not without reading a community review or two over at r/Scotch first.

**Nose:** A proper down and dirty mean Laphroaig nose. HUGE boggy and medicinal peat, chocolatey charred wood, vanilla, Islay brine, peat, ashy char, tar. A slight undercurrent of berries and earthy sweetness but not a huge sherry influence on the nose. There's some chocolatey smoothness that has tamed it a bit.

**Taste:** Hits a little hot with earthy berries and peppery spice heat, then that huge Laphroaig peat hits smooth and heavy, caramel, lots of smooth chocolate, toasted and charred barrel, medicinal peat, heavy vanilla, earthy sweetness. Kind of toned down and straight forward after the amazing nose, but there's plenty of delicious Laphroaig peat here and it's presented beautifully in all it's glory, there's just nothing else like it out there. Like the nose the sherry influence is minimal.

**Finish:** Thick chocolatey barrel notes, mild earthy-sweet berry, and vanilla with huge lumbering medicinal peat. It's a rich and chocolatey peat finish, really nice. 

*****

A smidge heavy on spice and heat and a little light on sherry influence, but there's tons of classic Laphroaig peat and chocolatey-charred barrel notes here, it's all very well presented and really fucking nice. I actually prefer Bourbon barrel Laphroaig so I don't mind the light sherry influence here. It's not some kind of golden barrel or a must-have stunner, but it's definitely enough to satisfy a die-hard Laphroaig fan if you are willing to shell out the $160(which isn't an unreasonable price for Laphroaig these days unfortunately). If you aren't a die-hard Laphroaig fan that is always looking for anything new you can find, it's not worth the price IMO. The 10yr Cask Strength or a Cairdeas bottling will satisfy the Laphroaig peat-lust just fine for half the price. 

For comparison, I happen to have another 13yr heavily peated Scotch aged in sherry barrels that I like much more than this: the Single Cask Nation Ledaig 13. But like I said before, Laphroaig peat is it's own thing and very special to me. Also for comparison, this drinks a little different than the 2019 Cairdeas TripleWood. This Chieftain's has less sherry and more of that classic heavy medicinal Laphroaig peat flavor, more vanilla and chocolatey barrel notes and ashy char, and a little more heat. The 2019 Cairdeas is a little sweeter and cleaner overall

I have this bottle as well and have really been enjoying it. Probably wouldn‚Äôt get it again once finished (for the price) but I really do like it.
You try the Ledaig 21 Chieftain's from K&L? I loved that one. The Laphroaig was certainly good as well but the Ledaig was something special imo.
I love the monkey poster! Where did you get it from?
Two years ago I found a bottle of 14 year old Chieftain's Laphroaig, 2003/2018. Your review reminded me of that. I absolutely loved it, but couldn't find another bottle no matter how hard I searched. It cost me around US$109, which, compared to what this 13 year old cost, was some kind of bargain, I suppose. I wish they had more IB's in New Hampshire. I had to go to Massachusetts to find the one I did.
>‚ÄùNose: A proper down and dirty mean Laphroaig nose.‚Äù

If I was shopping for a bottle and found one with this printed on the tube describing the nose, I‚Äôd buy that baby right up. When I read this, in my head I went, ‚Äú**yesssssss.**‚Äù

This sounds fantastic. Damnit, I think I‚Äôm leaving camp Lagavulin for camp Laphroaig. The more Frog I try the more endeared I become. Reviews like this just push me down the path.
Yeah I don't think it's quite good enough to warrant a backup bottle at the price, but I don't regret buying it and I'm enjoying the stuff.
No I haven't, but I was curious. I'm a big fan of ledaig.
I don't even know, I've had it such a long time. I think I might have inherited it from my dad
>yesssssss

That's exactly the kind of response I was trying to evoke lol, it just has that kind of sexy Laphroaig peat nose. The taste doesn't quite deliver the same level, but it's still really good. 

>I think I‚Äôm leaving camp Lagavulin for camp Laphroaig

I mean they both have their qualities. I love all kinds of peat, but Laphroaig was my first peated Scotch and it's always been special to me. It's real distinct with the heavy medicinal and vanilla notes. Lagavulin 12 is the Laga I've had that could really compete.
I didn't even notice the monkey poster until I read the above comment. I showed it to my wife, who is year of the monkey, and she wanted one right away. I'll have to do a search.......
I‚Äôm with you on the peat. Laga 16 was my first foray into smoky scotch and I immediately loved it. I next went on to the Laga 8 and 12 year and was branded a Lagavulin follower. But then Laphroaig 10 CS and C√†irdeas releases came along and are converting me."
Review #156: Colonel E.H. Taylor Bourbon,,https://i.redd.it/ttxqxra0csx41.jpg,"Delicious!
**Colonel E.H. Taylor Bourbon, Bottled in Bond, 50%**

**Nose:** Sweet smooth wood, beautifully toasted brown sugar, warm sweet orange citrus, corn sweetness, vanilla, mild sweet tannic char. Pleasantly woody and sweet, inviting and delicious. Incredible nose

**Taste:** Gentle and smooth woody flavor, an easy sipper. Sweet smooth chocolatey oak, brown sugar, orange, clean corn sweetness, caramel, a gentle tannic kick, musty wood. Even at 50% it's a light and easy-sipping Bourbon, lots of corn with inviting and pleasantly sweet woody flavor. Almost completely devoid of any spice or brash flavor

**Finish:** Smooth musty wood and light chocolate, caramel, clean Bourbon corn.

*****

It's good, even at 50% it drinks pretty light. Good for when you want a nice easy sipper, it's pleasant and well balanced with nice sweet woody flavor. It's not going to compete with higher proof bruisers imo, but it does it's own easy-sipping thing very well. I like how it retains a lot of clean Bourbon corn sweetness with smooth wood notes and balances it all in a very easy fashion. Also as someone who easily enjoys nosing just as much as tasting, the nose on this stuff is just divine.

Score: **7**

Wonderful stuff, my personal favorite.
This is nearly impossible to find in Northern NJ. I saw that a bottle shop 15 minutes from my home had one while I was just messing around online shopping. I immediately threw on my shoes and went to the store. When I arrived, there were two bottles at MSRP!!! During virtual church service today I thanked God for his benevolence. Cheers!!!
Nice review! Considering the popularity, whats a reasonable price for this bottle these days?
Gosh imagine the days where this was just always on the shelf. It would be one hell of a daily sipper. I have a couple bottles but it's harder and harder to find.
It's a popular one for good reason. I just wish more stores would stock it at its MSRP because it's a pretty good buy for $40.
Since you've done 156 reviews, what are your highest-rated bourbons so far?
Delicious.  Another one I can‚Äôt ever seem to get my hands on anymore.
Just opened my bottle of this today. Didn‚Äôt really do any tasting notes on it yet. Just wanted to crack it. But as you said, it‚Äôs delicious and pretty good stuff. Very easy sipper. Great review
I really liked EHT sB. So much from the BT line I haven't tried though. But for the effort to obtain those other bottles I'm thinking EHT sB is the bottle I'm settling on from here on out.
I've gotten it for $40 in NY and I'm honestly not impressed by it nor do I think it's worth it.  It tastes young and boring to me.  I know that's not the popular opinion here but I don't see the reason for the hype.  Besides, 1/4 of it's price goes into packaging, I just don't get it.
Well put lol, I love the enthusiasm
Surprised you didn‚Äôt taste any cherry.
Delicious stuff....
In SoCal it seems like it's only gotten easier to find, so I wouldn't pay any kind of premium. Right around $50 seems ok, I've seen it as low as $40.
I got one for $38 once in OH and never saw it again. Would definitely pay 50 all day
I dont know if I've ever given a 10 before actually, I have on a few scotches though. I also dont have a log that I can check all my scores unfortunately. But off the top of my head I'd gave to say highest scoring so far has been some Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (old bottle style), MGP Willett/SAOS single barrel eyes, Whistle Pig single barrels, and Four Roses PS's and LE bottlings.
Oh I beg to differ. Here in MN it's 40 - 45 and for that price theres its not much that can compete....Turkey rare breed aside I cant think of a single thing that offers the complete package E. H. Tailor does.  Not to mention this bottle takes no time 2 open up where rare breed takes months.
That's fair. I found it a little too light or boring as well, but I think it's good enough to enjoy as a low impact easy sipper, and tried to judge it and score it by that criteria.
Name a BiB in the $40 or under range that you consider better.
I really loved the second half of the bottle more than the first
Not op, but I used to get a lot of cheery with the rye, honestly.  I always love reading tasting notes because I feel like I often miss a lot, or have a different palate all together, so thanks for chiming in on this.
You know what, I'm still sipping and I can totally see that. I think I tend to associate cherry more with a strong sweet kind of cough syrup flavor found in stronger more brash Bourbons. This would be more of a gentle fruity cherry.
I‚Äôm glad you made this comment. I put this in a blind tasting last week and found a distinct cherry taste compared to the FR single barrel and Heaven Hill 7yr BiB I tasted in the same session. Thought I was maybe imagining something haha
Where did you find it in SoCal? I order from K&L when they get it occasionally.
40 in Vegas at total wine. 1 per customer. Love the stuff
Thanks to covid got one in Ohio April 21nd for 40.32 w tax. People know to line up at Tuesday open to get the choice of the weekly rare shipment. Got Weller antique the week before üòã. Took the eh over 1.75 Weller reserve option this time.
Did you happen to notice the laser code date for this? I really enjoyed this years eh taylor much better than last years.same as weller 12 some years are much better than others.
Why does it have to be a BiB and under $40? Most areas don't have it priced that low and BiB isn't an indicator of quality.  so let's do between $40-$50.  FR SiB, Eagle Rare, RR SiB, Maker's Cask, Knob Creek single barrel, WT Rare Breed. I think that sums it up
Totally with you on this and that association. Sometimes hard for me to get that cherry fruit note. A third cherry note I've found in my journey is that cherry cola taste...love that.
I've seen it in several little local stores, not usually as cheap as K&L but not a whole lot higher. I bought mine for $50 at my local.
Love the antique but not hot on reserve.
Where are you at that you're getting EH? Never seen it in Ohio personally. It's my favorite bourbon I have and I have to drive to Kentucky to find it
Where is the laser code? I don't see one on my bottle. I think my store got them in about 3 or 4 months ago if that helps.
I chose that criteria because I wanted to know something that is the same proof and a similar price that you consider better. I have all of the bottles you mentioned and would agree that RR SiB and Rare Breed are better overall, they also cost more and are higher proof.
Youngstown Boardman area. Check out ohlq.com if you never have. You can search what the state carries and if it's in stock. Fyi if the symbol is the half bottle it's probably pretty hard to find from my experience. Good to see pricing since a controlled state has fixed pricing statewide.
It should be down on very lower part of bottle kinda like the antique collection and pappy
He only commented on taste though, not proof, so it seems arbitrary to make 100 proof a criteria for comparison.  
At $40 - 50 a lot of options are available that I'd say are better and happen to be higher proof. If you're specifically looking for 100 proof bottles at that price though, we'll then I guess that's about your best option.
Found it, boy it's really faint. LL922L0L20:20D

Also, you're tripping if you think I've ever been close enough to a BTAC or Pappy to read a laser code lol.
Proof affects taste, you can't decouple the two!
There are many reasons for which one bourbon may taste different than another. I don't think proof automatically stands out as a criteria for comparison when the question is just ""which do you think is better"". You can have a bourbon that you think is better than another at any given proof. High proof can be better than low proof, low proof can be better than higher proof.   
I've had 90 proof bourbons that drink hotter than 140 proofers. I don't think proof itself is a good criteria for the topic of which bourbon is better at a given price."
Elijah Craig Barrel Proof blind tasting -FINAL RESULTS-,,https://i.redd.it/56oxqxfqijx41.jpg,"This is a bit long so I apologize in advance, but I have some thoughts after doing my blind tasting so here we go.

Back in 2017 Heaven Hill changed the bottle design for Elijah Craig Barrel Proof from [this](https://i.redd.it/k6rcj6u372cy.jpg) to [this](https://i.redd.it/yyqo3mi3jcq11.jpg), and ever since then there has been much discussion on how these newer batches compare to the originals. My personal experience is that these newer batches have not been as good. But I have certainly been wrong before, and bias can effect things(I hate the new bottle design), so I thought I should actually put it to the test and see. I put together a blind tasting of 10 different batches, 5 of the old bottle design and 5 of the new. I drank them all one at a time, totally blind, with no reveals until they were all completed. There was no method to which batches I selected, they are simply the ones I was able to get my hands on. It went great, I have posted all 10 reviews so here are the final scores(and links) from the blind tastings:

*****

On a positive note, there were some excellent batches in the new lineup. C919(8/10) I was already a big fan of, so I'm glad that it did well blind. C918(8/10) was actually a batch that I hadn't liked, so that was a very interesting turnaround and maybe my bias was indeed getting in the way there. But otherwise, the old batches basically obliterated the new lineup. Their highs were higher, the quality was way more consistent. There were 2 duds with the new bottles, there were 0 with the old.

I'm aware that as always, this is just my personal opinion and other people's tastes may vary. And to be fair, even the ""duds"" in the new batches were good Bourbons, they just weren't up to the quality of the old stuff IMO. What gets me isn't just the lower quality of the new batches(which is subjective), it's the change in the overall character of the Bourbon. The old batches had an amazingly consistent profile that never disappointed, there was just nothing out there like it. I had always found this to be true, and these blind tastings confirmed it. Every time I had an old batch in this tasting it felt like things were back on track, in familiar territory. Insanely dark and woody and thick, yet with an impossibly balanced and dense feel despite all the huge flavor, heat and spice. The new batches were all over the place, they were much hotter, more wild and astringent. For better or worse they just didn't taste like ECBP used to. The only new batch that had what I would call a ""classic ECBP"" character here was C918, and it's one of the 2 that got high marks.

As to the why they seemed to have changed, I have no idea and I'm super curious. They are still 12 years old, so it's not like there's a missing age statement to easily explain it away. Did Heaven Hill just get bored with the old profile and want to spice it up(or more accurately, ""astringent it up"")? Maybe they were working with less aged stock and couldn't keep up the same quality with what they had? From what I've seen, this stuff has only become easier to find so maybe it's the opposite: Using more barrels of a different quality/character to expand a popular line? I have no clue why they decided to change the Bourbon and the bottle at the same time. But from this blind tasting and my past experience, that seems to be what happened.

TL;DR New batches range from meh to great, old batches are amazing and reign supreme. I have no idea why things changed.

**EDIT:** thanks for the silver kind stranger!

**EDIT #2:** and the platinum, wowza!
This is a fantastic series so thank you. This is a common debate in this thread so it‚Äôs great to see the blind series to give some perspective.

One positive takeaway for those who don‚Äôt have any old bottles lying around is that most of the new ones are still great and some knock it out of the park. 

Up next...Bookers batches vs new ECBP‚Äôs ;)
Great series, great work. Cheers man!
Nice series and interesting results! I think we‚Äôre seeing more premium products out of HH to try and keep up with the high end of the bourbon market so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if some of the barrels made their way into WHH, HHSS, Parkers 11 (or future releases) or are being set aside for EC18 & 23. We‚Äôve noticed a big uptick in both quantity and quality of EC18 in the Bay. Clearly this is 100% wild ass speculation but it‚Äôs food for thought.
I‚Äôve been very curious to see how this series would turn out, and the results are as I feared haha. I‚Äôve never been able to try the older batches, but at least I have a C919. My god is it good. These results make me apprehensive to crack my A120 though.
Great series. I enjoyed reading the reviews. Even doing this blind you basically confirmed everyone‚Äôs suspicions that there has been a drop in quality from old label to new. I guess that can be expected in this crazy bourbon market nowadays anyway but still sad to see. 

Now, if you had to pick a favorite of the lot which would it be?
Appreciate you doing this, was really fun to follow and read. I‚Äôve only had C919 so I guess I‚Äôm a bit spoiled. Interested to see how this year‚Äôs batches come out. Haven‚Äôt had A120 yet.
B519 was the only batch ive purchased. Its no wonder it could be easily had for 50 bucks even in NY. In fact i can still find it at that price. Awesome reviews!
This is great.  I have c919 and it‚Äôs amazing one of the best I have had.  Will keep my eyes open for older batches.
I'll join the chorus of people appreciating your work here. Thanks for doing this, especially because so many of us have debated this point. The old label bottles are, uh, pretty good.
spot on reviews and analysis. one of the best series we've had here in a long time. thanks for putting this together.
Went to total wine and they were out of this.  Going to try another store this weekend, very excited to try it. Hoping to find a C919
Absolutely awesome that you did this.

I need more old label ECBP in my life.  C919 and A120 both give me more hope for the new label.  Even the ""ok"" ones, I'm still very to drink and I think are a fantastic deal at $55-65.

Great job with the reviews!
Anybody know anything about old bottle 134.8 proof? I think it's batch B-514... The batch numbering on this post has me confused. I didn't think they batched in just numbers.

EDIT: and of course thanks for putting up his together. I see it took a lot of effort and time. Appreciated.
Great series of reviews, very interesting and informative. Thanks for sharing!!
Very interesting and great writeup, was a pleasure to read :)
I just opened up a batch 7. Mind was blown!
You know, it's funny. I was talking about this with a friend of mine the other day, and I've mentioned it before to people I know. I remember a few years ago I tried a bottle of Elijah Craig and I really really liked it. I'm not going to pretend to have some super sophisticated palate for bourbon, but I definitely tasted a distinct flavor I really liked more than any other bourbon I'd had up to that point. It was when I first started drinking so I didn't have much to compare it too, but it was the bottle that really made me like bourbon and made me aware of how different they could be.

Since then I've picked up bottles of it a few times but they've never quite given me the same feeling. They weren't bad, but none hit the same high that first bottle did and I felt like the quality wasn't consistent. I wondered if I just got really lucky with the first bottle and had a particularly good bottle, if it was just something I was imagining or remembering as better than it was, or if something had actually changed. Now I wonder if this was it. Maybe I just had a good bottle from the older style shortly before they switched, the timing seems just about right if this happened in 2017.
I've enjoyed this series so much. My only disappointment is that old version batch 9 wasn't here, because it's my favourite and it would have been interesting to see your thoughts, since batch 11 was one that you thought the best, and is probably my number 2. It's a small and silly gripe though, since I really appreciate you doing this.
The 94 proof has a nice creamy bite to it.
Love my C919..almost done with B519.

Now, A120 out but not seen and now, B520 is releasing . A little different label...

""Notably, the bottom label of the bottle has changed ‚Äì its missing the black bar, and while it still notes batch number, proof, and proclaims the bourbon to be ‚ÄúUncut, straight from the barrel,‚Äù a line has been added to state ‚Äúwithout chill filtration.‚Äù  From Gobourbon.com
Oh yeah. Found an Elijah Craig 18 year...opened it, no resting and can you say oooooak! YIKES! Next time, let it sit..wow like drinking it off a plank of oaküòÆ
> I have no idea why things changed.

It‚Äôs obviously that damn new bottle design!
It's because they were using much older barrels blended with some 12 year barrels.... Now they are just using 12 year barrels.
Thanks for doing this! Super thorough and informative. I feel lucky because I recently found batch no 4 in an old liquor store and I'm very excited to try it.  


>I have no idea why things changed.

I'm going to guess over time it's gotten more popular, so they've had to be less selective with their barrels and blend more of them together with each release.
>it's the change in the overall character of the Bourbon. The old batches had an amazingly consistent profile that never disappointed, there was just nothing out there like it. 

...

>The new batches were all over the place, they were much hotter, more wild and astringent. 

Great series, well summarized here.

Although our tastes differ on a few of the details in the newer batches, on the whole I agree strongly with your overall conclusions, they match up well with my drinking experiences.

Somewhat counter-intuitively, part of me finds the newer batches more interesting intellectually, if not quite up to the drinking pleasure level of the old ones. Being more variable in character, they've become like Forest Gump's proverbial *box of chocolates*, you never know what you are going to get, from one batch# to the next. Which makes it more compelling wanting to try them all, to see what the high points & low points are in the series and whether they have any characteristics in common.

Thanks for all the work (for science!) which you put into this, Cheers!
My experience with the new ones is a bit more limited than this, but I agree 100%. A119 was not a good bourbon - it tasted burnt to me. The deep oaky, cherry and chocolate flavor the old ones had was gone.
> Using more barrels of a different quality/character to expand a popular line?

This would be my guess. alongside holding the better barrels for WHH, PHC and EC18
Thank you! I thought the same thing, with all the debate its good to actually put things to the test. Honestly I was trying to give the new batches a fair shake, I like having bias and expectations shattered in blind tastings sometimes. But it didnt work out that way. 

And I agree, there are still good batches coming out luckily even if the consistency isn't there
Cheers dude, thanks for reading! I'm glad you enjoyed it, because I really enjoyed doing it
Thanks for reading! It would be one thing if the quality suddenly dived and that was it, but it coincided perfectly with the bottle change like it was planned or they knew. It's just interesting to me.
C919 is delicious, it competed well with the older batches. My only complaint is that it isn't quite the same profile that I loved in the old stuff. But C918 did the old style well, so they are still capable of recreating it. 

Dont worry about opening up new ones, it could still be a cracker. None if these were actually bad, even if they didnt quite measure up to the old level.
Agreed, it is sad to see. The old ECBP batches were some of my early barrel proof Bourbon loves, and it's still some of the best stuff I've ever had. 

I think I had 2 favorites and it would be hard to pick one. Batch 11 (139.4) was my favorite ""classic ECBP"" profile. Batch 7 (128) was an amazing fucking Bourbon but off profile for an ECBP. It was lower proof and more approachable, still thick and woody but it had a creamy sweetness that was unreal. I love them both in their own way.
Thanks for reading, and I'm really glad you enjoyed it!
Aw shucks, thanks dude :D

I tried to put it together in a way that would be fun to read, the way that I like to read stuff like this. So I'm glad it worked out. Cheers
They use that batch numbering system on the newer batches. Batch A117, released in January of 2017, was the first batch with the redesigned bottle and the first batch to use that numbering system. The 12 batches that came out before that(which I refer to in this series as ""old batches"") only went by proof to distinguish themselves. I think the confusion is that some people have retroactively assigned this batch numbering system to the older batches. 134.8 was batch 5, it was never officially released as batch ""B514."" Some people are just calling it that. 

I'm not sure if you're aware how the code works but the last 2 numbers are the year, the first number is the month, and the letter is which release of the year it is. So somebody assigned ""B514"" to batch 5, simply meaning it's the 2nd release (B) of that year, came out in May(5) in the year 2014 (14).
Thanks buddy, glad you enjoyed it!
Are you talking about the Barrel Proof bottlings that I'm reviewing here or the standard 47% Elijah Craig? Because that was about the time that the standard bottling lost the 12yr age statement, so you very well might have noticed a difference in that. If you're talking about the BP, then yeah that's what we're all here wondering too.
Yeah I would have loved to get more batches and made this more comprehensive, but it took long enough getting these ones. I didnt want to wait forever to do it lol. But I'm glad you enjoyed the series, thanks for reading.
That BITCH Carole Baskin!
I think you nailed it.  

Once Heaven Hill realized they had a winner on their hands they made the decision to produce more, but it came at the cost of quality.  There just aren't enough old honey barrels to keep the old level of quality AND produce enough to make the bottles consistently available.  I love that the newer ECBP can be found in stores pretty easily, and for a reasonable price, but I'm sad that we've lost the crazy depth, richness and intensity of the old label stuff.
That's my guess as well, but I have no real idea.
Yes, I am trying not to rag on the new batches too much since they are still good and tastes can certainly vary. I'm just sad they changed the whole profile so drastically of one of my favorite Bourbons. But that is a totally fair opinion, that it adds a little spice and variety the way they do it now. It reminds me of Laphroaig Cairdeas. I haven't loved every release, but it's fun not knowing what you're going to get. That's just not what I was looking for with ECBP :(

And thanks for reading. You are one of the users here who's opinion I really respect, so I'm glad you enjoyed it.
I actually liked A119 a bit more than some of the other new batches, but yeah it didnt measure up to the old bottlings at all. One of these new batches reminded me of a FRPS, hot and fiery and brash. That's what I'm lamenting, I miss the old flavor profile and weight they had and the consistency. Maybe the new batches will be able to recapture it here and there, but there's so many duds and varying bottles that you dont know what you're buying with each batch. Another commenter mentioned that it actually adds a little variety and fun to the process, but I miss the old reliability and flavor.
Drinking the good stuff I bet you did have fun, it was fun to read for sure ;-)
Yep C919 is damn good. Almost done with B519 which I'm slowly sipping. Hope to find one elsewhere.
Awesome! Thanks so much for the knowledge.
I need to look if i can find a 136proof i never had it.. 
I share your thoughts on old vs new.. but i never had your favourite new ones"
"Review #155 - Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, Old vs. New Day 10: Batch 7 (128 proof)",,https://i.redd.it/gc7mlf6g5fx41.jpg,"**The Schtick:** Back in 2017 Heaven Hill changed the bottle design for Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (from [this](https://i.redd.it/k6rcj6u372cy.jpg) to [this](https://i.redd.it/yyqo3mi3jcq11.jpg)), and ever since then there has been much discussion on how these newer batches compare to the originals.

**Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, Blind Sample #10 of 10**

**Nose:** Thick and creamy. Nutty toffee, graham cracker, chocolate, huge musty toasted wood, smooth nutty char, creamy caramel and vanilla, fruity sweet cherry and mildly zingy spice cuts through a little. It's rather friendly for an ECBP, more ""fun"" and not so darkly sweet but still beefy and woody and delicious.

**Taste:** Wow, this is out of profile for an ECBP but it's really good. Huge clean toasted oak, thick & creamy nutty toffee, sweet bright vanilla, delicious fun cherry fruitiness, clean char, friendly mint spice. Oddly creamy and pleasant for an ECBP with fun fruity and floral notes. It works really well and has a thick and balanced feel

**Finish:** Bright creamy toffee, sweet vanilla, fruity candy cherry and friendly spice. Long and pleasant finish, really good.

* This one is completely out of left field, it's the most off-profile batch I've had of this entire lineup. But it's extremely well executed. It's not a dark and woody bruiser at all, it has a pleasantness and approachability that reminds me of a good Russel's Reserve. Thick and full flavored with a delicious creamy and fruity character, big clean oakiness, it's just so drinkable. I'm thinking it might be lower ABV than is normal for these as well, it certainly drinks like it.

Score: **9**

**Reveal:** Batch 7, 128 proof / 64%

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** Yet another stunner from the old batches, it's kind of a sealed deal at this point that they kind of run circles around the new stuff. At least amongst my random sampling. Being so out of character yet delicious made this a really fun one to close off the series with.

I‚Äôve loved every day of this
Between  B519 and C919, it's hard to say which I like better, but damn they are good!
[removed]
great series!

i'm happy with the outcomes and glad to see someone doing these blind came the same conclusion i formed just buying them off the shelf. those old batches were so good.
I actually liked Batch 7 best out of all the old ECBPs I tried.  It's indeed more approachable and less fiercely hot than the hazmat and nearly-so batches, and I honestly preferred that style.
Must have had quite the buzz lol
Absolutely loved this.  From my tastings I definitely agree.  I wish it wasn't so, but the old batches are better for sure.  That said, I still enjoy the new batches a lot and think they are probably the best value in Bourbon at $55.
Great series of reviews man! The only downside is that it‚Äôs really making me regret not stocking up on those old bottles before they changed over to the new ones. So any thoughts on what has played a role in the slippage in quality of these new bottles? In theory, the specs are the same - barrel proof 12 year bourbon.
So which one was the winner?
Batch 7 is my last unopened ECBP in the old bottles.  Lower proof here may mean lower in the rickhouse/stack which could give it less barrel extract.  Therefore a more gentle profile.  If that's the case, I'm stoked.  I'll get to it months down the road, but will remember your good write-up.
Wow, thanks! I appreciate that. I had a lot of fun doing it. I wish I had been able to make it even bigger now with more samples, but it took long enough to get all these together and I didnt want to put it off any longer.

And I'm still going to do one more post for the final results, I had thought I might just put it here bit didnt want it to be too massive of a post.
I can tell you that both those batches were in my series(see the table in the leadup to the review), and for my tastes C919 did way better in the blind reviews.
Sorry buddy they are gone, the last one was released in 2016. There are secondary markets out there on Facebook and other places that (illegally) buy and trade stuff like this, but I've never been involved in that stuff and they certainly don't allow it here on r/Bourbon or Reddit. I believe the going rate for an old batch on secondary was $200 last I heard.
Honestly I felt the same with my experience, I was trying to give the newer batches a fair shake with all this. I love having my bias and expectations shattered in blind reviews, so I was fully prepared to be wrong. But the results speak for themselves. Even though this series isn't totally comprehensive it kind of goes a little further in confirming what I already knew unfortunately.
I didn't realize that I had a batch like that on my hands when I went in, it's neat that I came to a similar conclusion in a blind tasting. I know the lower proof didn't help with a couple of the new batches I had in this lineup. The B519 is only 61.1% and it's still hot and astringent
I did these over several days, at these proofs it might have killed me otherwise lol
Thanks for reading! It was a blast 

>So any thoughts on what has played a role in the slippage in quality of these new bottles?

I have no idea why. I'm going to post the final results of the series tomorrow and bring that up, hopefully I get some input because I want to know as well.
Loving these reviews.  And particularly loving the fact I have a sealed Batch 7 in my bunker.  Never tasted it before, but increasingly tempted to crack it.
I really loved all the old ones I tasted and c919 had been my favorite of the new stuff. I just got my 5th bottle of it this week. So with 4 in back stock I think I‚Äôm comfortable. It‚Äôs so damn good
Oh hell, now I see the new release B520 hitting stores soon. They changed the label a bit too.
C919 is a winner in my book...looking for more after almost draining B919. Looking for A120 in the area, but C919 is really a great batch, even at that proof really smooth. 

Never thought EC was so good.

Just opened the Elijah Craig 18..wow..ooooooak. Oak hits hard on first sip. Needs to open up more, but not too bad. I'll take the C919 over the 18 for sure.
There‚Äôs been a price creep - I asked my buddy how much they were going for after reading some of your reviews and apparently asking price is $300+.
My speculation is that they‚Äôre producing more ECBP with the new bottles so the overall quality of the barrels has decreased because they can‚Äôt be as selective. I‚Äôm basing that on no information though.
That's awesome! I have a few different batches stashed away as well, but none of them are 9/10's reviewed here. This batch 7 was something else. Probably my favorite alongside the 139.4 (batch 11), but a unique enough profile that they are each outstanding in their own way.
You were able to get your hands on FIVE bottles of that....how?
Oh really? What did they change about the label?
I'm not surprised, especially after doing this series
I live a half mile from total wine. I work a mile and.a half from another. Every Wednesday they have allocated stuff so I pop out of work right when they open (I get to work at 7, cool boss who loves whiskey too) and see what they have. Every Saturday I get there right when they open since they‚Äôll randomly have allocated stuff then too. 2 weeks ago I got a stagg jr at msrp. It‚Äôs always msrp there. 

I support my local small shops with wine and beer and other random whiskey but I always check twice a week there and get stuff constantly. They have McKenna 10 every other week for $35, larceny barrel proof, nikka from the barrel, etc. 

Worth the time imo. But c919 is one of my all time favorites.
Info here: https://www.gobourbon.com/this-years-second-barrel-proof-batches-of-larceny-and-elijah-craig-are-hitting-shelves-soon/
"" Notably, the bottom label of the bottle has changed ‚Äì its missing the black bar, and while it still notes batch number, proof, and proclaims the bourbon to be ‚ÄúUncut, straight from the barrel,‚Äù a line has been added to state ‚Äúwithout chill filtration.‚Äù  From Gobourbon.com
Thanks!
Thanks!
If the A120 or the B520 is close to C919, I'll be very happy. 

Sad that my B519 is almost goneüò´"

**Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, Blind Sample #9 of 10**

**Nose:** So. Much. Wood. Powerful dark tannic oak, beautifully thick and charred and toasted, smooth chocolatey wood, vanilla, tobacco, barrel-aged dark cherry cola, burnt woody caramel, minty spice undercurrent. Frighteningly huge and thick

**Taste:** Huge, hot, thick, not for the faint of heart. Huge thick darkly toasted oak, burnt woody char, delicious tobacco, burnt caramelized sweet barrel notes, chocolate. Hot spice and sticky-sweet cherry cough syrup builds and cuts through, adding a darkly bright and hot complexity that compliments the huge dark oak beautifully. Wonderful stuff.

**Finish:** The thick, hot and oaky flavor just keeps building bigger and bigger. TONS of mouth-numbing cherry syrup and menthol oak spice, deep caramel root beer char and thick woody goodness.

* Another favorite, hot dang I'm losing track of how many favorites I have in this series. It doesn't do anything that the more standard(but still amazing) releases haven't done, it just does it better. It's thicker, fuller, more powerful yet balanced. These better releases are good at balancing all these impossibly huge notes with each other but without sacrificing the brute force of it all one bit. And there's a nice chocolatey smoothness despite all the brash hot flavors. Just tons of complex wood notes, this stuff is unreal.

Score: **9**

**Reveal:** Batch 12, 136 proof / 68%

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** This is an interesting one because it is the very last release of the old bottle design, from September of 2016. It shows that even though I've had some mixed/subpar results from the new batches, the old ones were in no way slouching even towards the end of their run. One of the newer batches from the very next year(C917) was one of my duds actually, only 2 batches removed from this zinger.

Maybe it's just a bourbon thing, but nowhere you mention ethanol or solvent as a note? I've had this exact bottle as well, and although it is indeed very good, the ethanol is very noticable and not very well integrated?
Cool, batch 12 was the only one of the old style bottles I was ever able to get.
Yeah, I remeber this batch was a real cracker.
One of my favorite ECBPs ever. I really missed this batch when it was gone (and even more so switching over to the new style bottles in 2017).
I wound up with three of these bottles in the bunker (I used to have a habit of buying two of each new ECBP release) so this report is very welcome.
Everyone's tastes are different, you might just be more sensitive to it. Or I maybe I just acclimated to it after drinking so many, this was my ninth ECBP in a row(not in the same night). Some of the lower scoring batches like C917 and  B519 had more noticable alcohol burn than this one to me
Better one than none! And to be fair, there's still some really good batches coming out. They just aren't as consistent as these older bottlings, IMO.
You aint lyin'
Glad you got to enjoy it at least. Happy cake day!
I mean especially when compared to scotch with an almost equal abv (most scotches are a bit lower proof). For example I have a 68.5% bunnahabhain which has the alcohol far better integrated than this one. 

I just find it weird that with ECBP nobody really mentions ethanol as a note because it is so obviously there, like an elephant in the room to me.
I'm a big Scotch drinker too, and Bourbon is a lot hotter overall. There's a lot more spice and hot burning flavors. Maybe you're just picking up all the heat and spice as ethanol? Or maybe it's something Bourbon drinkers get acclimated to, or you could simply be more sensitive to it. Hell on days where I'm having allergies or getting over a sickness, all I taste on any Whisk(e)y is ethanol, even stuff that is low ABV. Maybe your taste was off whenever you tried it? Do you pick it up on other high proof Bourbons, or just this?
As an example, I find Stagg jr to have a lot more alcohol taste/smell than these really good ECBP batches. I still like Stagg jr, but it really needs some time to settle down.
Im with you. Opened up my first EC the other day and the ethanol note to me was so strong, I couldn't get passed it. Taste was good, but I then cracked open a Russell's reserve and it was night and day to me. Maybe I'm just a wild turkey guy ü§ô
Exactly! It is a good drinker, but not exactly a good nosing whiskey"

*****

**Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, Blind Sample #8 of 10**

**Nose:** Big dark mysterious oak bomb, we are back on track after the #7 dud. Dark woody maple syrup, deeeep daaaark toasted and charred oak(my god!), heavy delicious wood char, clean rich caramel, savory bbq and spice, vanilla, maple dessert pastry and toffee, vanilla, smoothly charred chocolate and menthol lingers. Amazing nose

**Taste:** Wow, this one's a doozy. Thick, huge, dense, deep, I need a thesaurus for all the different ways to say BIG. But it's amazingly balanced at the same time. Sticky oozy dark cherry syrup that isn't overly sweet at all. Big thick chocolatey charred and toasted oak, dark vanilla, burnt caramel, oak oak oak, smooth chocolate, savory and minty spice that just floats along very evenly with all the dark sweet oak.

**Finish:** Darkly burnt cherry syrup and delicious bright menthol spice build huge and bright with brash heavy oak, it's so big yet so clean.

* I think I have a new favorite here, and that's saying something. For how epicly huge the flavor is, it's amazingly clean and balanced, even smooth. It has a little bit of everything: Tons of the typical dark oak bomb/cherry syrup character but it's chocolatey rich and has a food-like thickness I can almost chew on, sweet barrel notes, heavy wood, deliciously balanced spice, it all comes together beautifully in a big way.

Score: **9**

**Reveal:** Batch 11, 139.4 proof / 69.7%

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** Another zinger of an old batch, there is just no denying the quality here. So far all the old batches have been zingers. But for one to emerge as such a clear favorite amongst so many excellent batches is pretty impressive. It's still definitely in line with the flavor profile of the other old batch bottles, it just does it a little better.

i called it! team ECBP 11 or GTFO lol

loving the series, looking forward to the next!
Hands down the best bourbon I have ever tried. Better than GTS or WLW or any of the Van Winkles. 

Got a bottle of this when I was working in Scotland (of all places)last year. Seen it gathering dust in a whisky shop so bought one of the two that were there then once I got home 6 hours later and tried it then phoned the shop and bought the other.
Batch 11 > all. I get buttered popcorn for dayzzzzz. Just an absolute palate-punching pour.
This is my favorite of the old batches, I'm lucky to have them all. I have two more left of this one. Just quarantine killed one. It's amazing whiskey.
I have about a half bottle of the 139.4 left.

I agree, it's the gold standard I use to judge each newer batch.
I had no idea that I had such a popular batch in here. I was more excited to have the Hazmat actually. Makes me feel good that this one did so well blind, you guys are definitely onto something with loving this batch so much.
I commented to someone else with this as well, but I had no idea this was such a popular batch. I was more excited to have Hazmat in here, but this one was the real deal.
I can see why. I'm a big fan of the old batches, and so far they have performed amazingly in this blind series. But this one was definitely a notch above.
Agreed. My bottle is almost gone. At least I have plenty of C919. Not exactly the same, but pretty damn close.
Since I find the old batches >>>> new batches (which doesn't discount the quality of the new batches) this is de facto my favorite but yeah, what a flavor bomb."

**Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, Blind Sample #7 of 10**

**Nose:** Brash bitter wood, thin hot cherry, metallic caramel, chocolate toasted oak, nutty wood. Astringent and noticeably thin compared to the nose on others, and a strong bitter copper note.

**Taste:** Fiery and hot but a tad thin(for an ECBP). Brash hot wood with lots of hot cherry and peppery spice, sticky-sweet caramel, astringent fiery heat, metallic bitterness, not bad but not a completely pleasant experience. It's thin, feels like the brash flavor and heat all comes at you in a flash. It mellows nicely with some air but never develops the thickness and body I love in these.

**Finish:** Nicer on the finish but still doesn't deliver like I know it ought to by now. Hot brash cherry and menthol spice that lingers a long time.

* Enjoyable, but easily my least favorite so far. It doesn't have that insanely huge and thick feel I love in these, it feels a tad thin and the hot flavors come at you in a flash instead of building and oozing. #4 was the only other ""dud"" I've had, but I felt like I was nitpicking that one. This one is almost disappointing for an ECBP. It's still enjoyable, I enjoy a nice brash and fiery Bourbon like this. Kind of reminds me of a FRPS. But it's just not the beast I'm looking for with an ECBP.

Score: **6**

**Reveal:** Batch C917, 131 proof / 65.5% 

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** Once again a newer batch fails to perform like the classic bottles do. This one wasn't even close, it was clearly a different fiery and hot profile from the thicker and darker older batches. Similar to the B519 on Day 4, but C919 did this style a lot better IMO.

another great review. this part is spot on:

>it was clearly a different fiery and hot profile from the thicker and darker older batches
Really enjoying this series. Thank you!
Couldn't agree more.
Thanks! It was so much fun seeing the reveal at the end, because at the time I had no idea if these hotter batches that popped up were just all over the place, old, new, or what. To see that all 3 I categorized as a similar ""fiery and hot"" profile were newer releases is pretty telling. C919 made it work really well even if it wasn't the ""classic"" style to me, but not so much for this one and A119.
I'm glad you're enjoying it, because I sure enjoyed doing it
Agreed on all counts & with signde. Thanks for doing these!"

**Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, Blind Sample #6 of 10**

**Nose:** This one is heavy on the menthol and cool spice. Rich cherry cola, tobacco, so much big charred and deeply toasted wood, toffee, heavy layer of cool menthol spice. Dark oak is off the charts.

**Taste:** Every sip is like a punch to the palette. Big brash cherry spice and cola syrup punch with tons of huge toasted oak, lots of corn sweetness, mean dark tannic wood, tobacco, the spice and dark sticky-sweet cherry cola builds huge. This one is a bit more tannic than others so far but in a good way.

**Finish:** Big oaky finish with caramel, tannic wood, and tons of brash lively spice. Lingering menthol and oak char.

* Dark heavy oak is off the charts on this stuff, and I'm happy to say that even after tasting so many back to back it's not something you acclimate to and get bored with. This one has more corn, sweet barrel notes, and spice shining through but without compromising one bit on that ridiculously thick and woody character. It's a subtle difference from the others, but I think this might be a favorite so far.

Score: **8**

**Reveal:** Batch 10, 138.8 proof / 69.4%

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** These older batches have such a consistent profile compared to the newer ones, and they knock it out of the park with ease.

I personally think, when I find cola in a bourbon it‚Äôs an indication of high quality! Not one to one per say, but a good rule of thumb. 

I‚Äôm very interested by the descriptor ‚Äúdark heavy oak‚Äù. That sounds fascinating? How you found that in other ECBP‚Äôs? I haven‚Äôt yet read all your reviews on the bourbon. I‚Äôm very curious to try this batch. Maybe one day I‚Äôll get lucky & see an other ECBP sitting on the shelf; I won‚Äôt hold me breath though.
>These older batches have such a consistent profile compared to the newer ones, and they knock it out of the park with ease.

absolutely.

curious to see when you get to 11 if it stands out better than the rest of the older ones. when i last did a side by side of new vs. old, it was against batch 11 and oh man was it good.
Batch 10 is a top 5 pour for me. It's the only bottle I've sought out and overpaid ($200) for, but it's my special occasion bottle.

Only stuff I've had Id pick over it is a couple of GTS releases, and most WLWs I've had.
Great review. When I‚Äôm reaching for these I often have to end my night with them due to the big bold characteristics you mentioned. 

Having a pour of old label prior to another dram can really make the second pour seem very muted. Great stuff. Everything I love in a bourbon.
[removed]
These older ECBP's have a pretty consistent character, and ""dark heavy oak"" is one of the ways I describe it. Reviewing so many in a row I almost could have just got a thesaurus to find different ways of saying ""heavy,"" ""thick,"" ""dense,"" ""huge,"" ""epic."" I think all those words come up at some point in this series lol. They are insanely huge and oaky, but it's not tannic bitter oak or friendly toasted oak. It's a mean, dark, and heavy oak. But still very well balanced. I don't know if that explanation helps you lol, it's hard to put into words but that's exactly what we're trying to do with reviewing I guess.
I think batch 11 is on day 8, so it should be posted tomorrow after the next one later today. Spoiler alert though, I did like it a lot. 

Also I meant to ask you about my flair. Is it correct for having 150 reviews, or do I get a Chevron now?
Batch 11 for the win!!
Right on, this is actually a bottle I had on hand and open already for this series, so I feel lucky! 

Have you had many other old batch Elijah Craig Barrel Proof bottles? Because I totally agree that it's awesome, but in this blind tasting I found it to be pretty consistent with the quality of all these old bottles overall. 3 others even did better.
Yeah they are just impossibly huge. I've had other Bourbons with high proof or some good age on them that still can't match how thick and bold these are but still be so balanced. Not sure what it is. 

Now that I'm on it, I'm trying to think of something else that is this old *and* this high proofed, and I can't. Maybe KC Single Barrels could attain this if they were bottled at a full proof higher than 120? I've never had any BTAC but I imagine some of those might be similar as well.
> These older batches have such a consistent profile compared to the newer ones, and they knock it out of the park with ease.

100%. It really feels like before EC12 dropped its age statement these were 12yr honey barrels and after they just started throwing in anything 12 years old and it shows. For me, it went from a buy-on-sight bottle to grabbing one/year just to check in on the profile.
That does help! I appreciate you taking the time to elaborate.
i just updated it, i think. i barely even remember the old flair number system. i used to update flair as i came to posts but it only works on old reddit and i moved on new reddit quite a while ago.

looking forward to the batch 11 review!
one or two, not all of them. wish I had.

I've had batch 10 in a tasting along with 3 newer ecbps, a couple store pick 94pf, and a William heaven hill from last year. out of those batch 10 was the defacto winner for me. The other old releases were long enough ago I can make a comparison based on memory.
GTS lite. Different profile but packs the same punch and has the same depth. They truly don‚Äôt make em like they used to. 

You‚Äôre right though. If they made these 15yr KC SiBs barrel proof, it‚Äôd be interesting as hell.
I've been resisting Reddit's every attempt to switch me over to the new format, I'm still stubbornly clinging to old reddit. I didnt even realize there was no flair on the new format.

Well its updated on my end, so thanks!
Are you saying ECBP is GTS lite? Jesus lol. I'm kind of half-assed boycotting BTAC, since it's so impossible to get anyway. I live in a rural area hours away from any decent stores, so hunting or lotteries or developing a relationship isnt something I'm able to do. I'm not into bars, and I wouldn't pay $50+ for a 1oz pour anyway. So my plan with pappy/BTAC is to wait until hopefully one day in the distant future, when production and aging catch up with demand, I can just buy it. 

Rant over, sorry.
i resisted for a very long time too but i'm on the mobile app a lot more often now and it's basically not even an option there. i finally gave in.

there are some things that are nicer but i miss stuff like flair. also the mod tools that work on old reddit don't even exist on new reddit.
Old label ECBP vs. newer GTS releases isn‚Äôt as far off as they should be imo. Probably an unpopular opinion. 

Old label retailed for $50ish right? GTS retails for $90. Secondary? $200 vs. $450. 

I‚Äôd 100% take 2x of old label ECBP batches 8,9,10, or 11 over 1 2019 GTS. That‚Äôs just me though."

*****

**Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, Blind Sample #5 of 10**

**Nose:** Dense, thick. Huge dark toasted oak that is somehow brash and smooth at the same time, burnt cola, tobacco, vanilla, thick fudge. Very dark and smooth spice way in the background. It's like a slumbering beast.

**Taste:** Dark, woody and sweetly burnt. Deep deep deeply toasted oak, darkly charred wood, burnt cherry soda syrup, chocolate cherry, tobacco, nutty burnt caramel, big smooth wood spice

**Finish:** Brighter burnt and toasted wood with vanilla and delicious dark lingering cherry wood spice. A long incredible finish which I'm getting used to with these.

* Another beast and another winner. This one doesn't explode with fiery heat at all, it's like a gigantic sludgy hot beast of thick, dark flavor. So much complex toasted and charred wood, the age just works beautifully on this stuff. And this one isn't as syrupy sweet or spicy, which really seems to work for me. Almost a 9 but it's just a bit too closed

Score: **8**

**Reveal:** Batch C918, 131.4 proof / 65.7%

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** This one has that classic thick dark woody profile, pulls it off better than any of the new batches I've tried yet. C919 seems to be getting a lot of love, and as good as that one is this C918 drank more like an old-school ECBP. My favorite of the new batches so far I think. Which is weird, because I actually have this bottle and I would not have rated it this high before. But I gotta stick with the blind results, removing bias is why I'm doing this.

ECBP is definitely one of the best values in bourbon! Batch C918 hits all the right notes for me and personally still the best I've had. Now I haven't had the C919 yet or A120 but until then it holds the title for me.

FWIW I don't usually add water to my whiskey but adding just a couple drops to C918 brilliantly awakens more of the flavors of this beautiful bourbon.

Great review and I'm loving this series of ECBP reviews and looking forward to the rest!
Oh man, you drank a lot of Elijah Craig for this. ECBP may be my favorite bourbon currently. Perhaps I‚Äôll grab a bottle of C918 if I stumble upon it. Thanks for sharing!
How much do these cost?
I haven't done them head to head but based on my blind reviews here, C918 and C919 are both good just with slightly different profiles. I'd be hard pressed to pick a favorite between the 2 without doing a sbs. 

I'm glad you are enjoying it, and thanks for reading! I just posted day 6
>Oh man, you drank a lot of Elijah Craig for this.

A tough job, but someone had to do it. Seriously though, I enjoyed every minute of it. Thanks for reading!
55-65 is retail, easily worth that price in my opinion."

*****

**Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, Blind Sample #4**

**Nose:** Oddly mellow and pleasant. Deep toasted oak with a charred and bitter edge, gritty graham cracker toffee, sweet wood spice, mildly zingy and astringent cherry, strong menthol spice kick

**Taste:** Surprisingly clean and light(for an ECBP) but still very brash. Sweet caramel, hot metallic cherry, lots of delicious fiery spice and vibrant brash wood, sticky sweet toffee, slightly bitter toasted oak. It's fiery and bright and brash compared to the darker more burnt ones I've had, similar to #1.

**Finish:** A bit astringent on the finish, harsh cherry with brash wood and big zingy spice. Leaves a little bitter

* My least favorite so far, but still a decent Bourbon. It's a bit disjointed and and lacking the huge presence of the others, but it's nothing too bad until that finish comes in. The finish is overly thin and astringent, and leaves a bitter taste. None of it is enough to ruin the experience, but it's a noticeable low point in the lineup so far.

**Reveal:** B519 122.2 proof / 61.1%

Score: **6**

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** New batches had been holding their own ok until now, but this dud on the heels of the stellar Batch 6 is a serious blow to the newer batches in this contest. It also happens to be the lowest proof offering in this whole lineup, so maybe lower proof on these just doesn't work for me.

really enjoying these. i think i foresee some more sixes in the new batches.
[removed]
Glad you're enjoying it, because I sure had fun doing it. And you may be right haha.
It is unusually smooth/toned down for an ECBP, they get much bigger and bolder and hot than this one. Honestly 6 for me is not a bad score, it's still thoroughly enjoyable. Keep in mind that lot of the point of this series I'm doing is to nitpick a little. It got drank blind against some heavy hitters.

>How often do these get released and when?

Apologies if you already know this but the batch code tells when it was released. The ""19"" in your bottle code denotes year(2019), ""5"" denotes the month(May), and the letter in the beginning is which release of the year it is(""B"" being the 2nd release that year). I've never seen a letter higher than C so I believe it gets released 3 times a year in January, May, and September.
I'm not sure, so feel free to correct me, but I think they come out twice a year?

Batch B519 has definitely been the most divisive I think. There's people like you and I who like it very much and others who are unimpressed.
> It is unusually smooth/toned down for an ECBP

That's my favorite part about B519 haha
It's 3 times a year, you can tell from the bottle codes. I gave an explanation in my own reply to OP"

**Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, Blind Sample #3 of 10**

**Nose:** Dark toasted oak, leather, graham cracker, toasted pecans, chocolate, dark cherry syrup, mellow spice undercurrent. It has a dark burnt and woody smoothness that is delicious with the dark cherry syrup

**Taste:** Burnt, dark and sweet. A beast of a Bourbon with flavor that just keeps building. Thick burnt black cherry soda and wood spice, bold darkly toasted wood, minty spice, dark oak char, minty and burnt, tobacco. Not overly tannic or sweet, just the right balance of huge bold woody flavors

**Finish:** Bright sweet black cherry and big bold spice that builds huge with tons of dark toasted wood, a super long and woody-sweet finish.

* This is exactly the kind of stuff I think of when I think Elijah Craig Barrel Proof. Huge, dark and so woody. It's crazy how dark this is without being too bitter or tannic, and that dark burnt sweetness is beautiful. This tastes like one of the hotter ones so far too.

**Reveal:** Batch 6, ""Hazmat"" 140.2 proof / 70.1%

Score: **8**

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** Makes sense that it felt hotter than the others, it's only the highest proof release of ECBP ever. It was immediately apparent that this was a more ""classic"" ECBP style and on a whole other level from the other samples so far. Exactly what I'm looking for in an ECBP. Incredible stuff.

Other than the heat this bottle sounds delicious!

On another note someone I was talking to yesterday said they found ECBP to be thin and boring. Reading a review like this after that talk made me chuckle
This is the next bottle in my radar I think. Though I don't have a specific batch in mind, I'm still very excited to try it
Great review. You touched upon the ‚Äúbalance‚Äù you tasted and that‚Äôs something I definitely feel old label had right whereas new label can lack. I hate to sound like a broken record but new label can have an astringency that needs air. I enjoy it but sometimes not upon a freshly opened bottle. Old label I find to be bolder, more balanced, and good start to finish. Also more consistent.
There is no shop I can find in Australia that even sells this!
The old bottle really looks a lot better. Would love to get my hands on one of these.
Awesome review. I agree with your notes. I was lucky enough to get my hands on this bottle and glad I got to share with you, man. I'm really enjoying the series!
I would usually use ""heat"" in a negative way in a review but it's not really a bad or astringent kind of heat here. It's just part of the huge assault on your senses. It's a wonderful and huge kind of heat lol

And yeah I dont know what bottle your friend was talking about but he might be confused. Even with the lesser batches ""thin and boring"" these are not.
Be warned, it's some powerful stuff. There's some batch variation in them these days I'm finding, but it can still be really excellent judging from the recent C919 release. And it seems like it's easier to find than it used to be too. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy it!
I agree, and yes ""astringent"" has come up in these reviews in reference to the newer batches. 

For bottles like this one, ""balanced"" almost feels like the wrong word just because it sounds a little boring and tame to me. But this definitely isn't boring or tame, it has a nice balance while still being incredibly thick and huge and hot(in a good way).
Yeah I dont like the newer bottle design
Thanks for help and thanks for the input, cheers!
A good heat. I like the phrase ""huge assault on your senses"" haha

Oh yeah that guys seems confused. It was just funny timing. I've never had a thin or boring batch of ECBP!
Thanks! I see it on the shelf fairly often which means I won't see it the moment I want to buy it.  It's generally in the $60-70 range which is a high asking price for me.  But it will happen one day.
I know exactly what you mean. And when you‚Äôre talking about 140proof, balanced says a lot. Old label has a ton of oak and heat yet manages to keep them all in check without one element overtaking another. That‚Äôs truly what makes a remarkable bourbon imo.
It's balanced like a circus elephant on a little ball"

**Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, Blind Bample #2 of 10**

**Nose:** Thick sweet dark cherry cola, darkly sweet and hot, burnt oak, tobacco, smooth chocolate, vanilla, musty tannic wood, menthol spice. Dark, syrupy, and hot

**Taste:** Huge fucking flavor that just keeps building, oh my god. Thick sticky-sweet dark cherry syrup, burnt dark sweets and huge menthol spice, lots of darkly toasted burnt oak, tobacco and spice. It's a juggernaut of dark and burnt syrupy sweetness.

**Finish:** Zingy and spicy dark cherry soda syrup with lots of huge peppery wood spice

* After the bright fiery heat of #1 this is more of a dark and mysterious heat. It's not as action-packed but it has a nice syrupy-sweet thickness, although it feels a bit too dark and too hot. It's a pleasure to drink and it's a force to be reckoned with.

Score: **7**

**Reveal:** A119, 135.2 proof / 67.6%

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** Had more of a ""classic"" ECBP profile than other newer batches I've tried which I really liked, but unfortunately it didn't totally come together or pull it off quite as well. Still a delicious Bourbon, but doesn't quite rise up to the level of greatness of the older stuff I've had.

I‚Äôd agree, this was good, c919 is the best they‚Äôve done since they changed the bottles
This is a blind tasting series a lot of us have been waiting for - I‚Äôm super excited to read them. Thanks for doing this!
Nice review! Glad you enjoyed. Cant wait to read the rest of them.
Sure thing, thanks for reading. It's been a blast, so I hope you enjoy reading them as well. 

I would have liked to do a larger sample size, but it was enough work getting all these together so I didnt want to wait forever to do it. Figured this was a pretty good random assortment, almost half the batches of each bottle style.
Thanks! I cant wait to post them"
"Review #146 - Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, Old vs. New Day 1: Batch C919",,https://i.redd.it/a91dmcu50nv41.jpg,"**The Schtick:** Back in 2017 Heaven Hill changed the bottle design for Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (from [this](https://i.redd.it/k6rcj6u372cy.jpg) to [this](https://i.redd.it/yyqo3mi3jcq11.jpg)), and ever since then there has been much discussion on how these newer batches compare to the originals. I thought it would be fun to put it to the test and see. So I put together a blind tasting of 10 different batches, 5 of the old bottle design and 5 of the new. I drank them all one at a time, totally blind, with no reveals until they were all completed. There was no method to which batches I selected, they are simply the ones I was able to get my hands on. Should be fun!

The batches that are in the mix:

*Old bottle design:*

Batch 6, 140.2 proof / 70.1%

Batch 7, 128 proof / 64%

Batch 10, 138.8 proof / 69.4%

Batch 11, 139.4 proof / 69.7%

Batch 12, 136 proof / 68%

*New bottle design:*

C917, 131 proof / 65.5%

C918, 131.4 proof / 65.7%

A119, 135.4 proof / 67.7%

B519, 122.2 proof / 61.1%

C919, 136.8 proof / 68.4%

*****

**Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, Blind Sample #1 of 10**

**Nose:** Powerful brash oak, hot cherry and delicious spice heat. After some air time there's lots of darker toasted notes, vanilla, graham cracker, maple, dark woody caramel, gritty char

**Taste:** Deep hot cherry and wood spice, brash and fiery, cinnamon heat, deep gritty toasted oak, sweet vanilla and char. It's brash and hot but in a good way, the flavor is powerful and huge, delicious.

**Finish:** Builds beautifully with bright fiery spice and hot cherry, it's a bright and spicy cracker of a finish. The spice lingers a long time.

* This stuff is a huge fiery punch in the best way. The nose settles into some nice darker chocolatey and toasted oak notes, but on the palate it's a deliciously wild and hot kicker of a Bourbon. It doesn't quite have that epic thick and sludgy darkness I normally associate with ECBP but it's still massive and does it's fiery thing really well.

Score: **8**

**Reveal:** C919, 136.8/68.4%

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** I've been enjoying this release a lot, it's probably been my favorite so far of the newer batches that I've tried. So I'm glad it did so well blind. I'm surprised with how off-profile and fiery it felt, but it does it's thing fucking beautifully so no complaints.

C919 is a good batch. Can't wait to read about the old ones though!
ECBP, C919 in particular, is so fantastic at $60 that it forces buyers to really think twice before purchasing any bourbon in the $100+ category. It makes you really wonder why producers like Kentucky Owl, J. Magnus, or annual releases like Woodford Batch Proof even try to compete at their price points when ECBP is so accessible (relatively), MUCH cheaper, and so much tastier.
This sounds like a fun project / blind series.  I didn't get into spirits until long after the ""old"" style of ECBP was gone, so the new ones have all performed decently well for me.
fun idea for a series! i look forward to the results. like /u/shooterflatch, i‚Äôm firmly in the old bottles were better camp. i also think c919 is the best new one i‚Äôve had. it was exceptional, on par with the older releases.
It is exceptional I love it
I have B519 and it is REALLY smooth and tasty.  The aftertaste lingers and doesn‚Äôt burn your nostrils when you breath out.  I am still hunting for the C919
B518 is my favorite of the new batches. I sbs‚Äôd it to one of the lesser old label batches (batch 12) and while it came close, old label won out. Haven‚Äôt sbs‚Äôd it with other older batches because I feel it wouldn‚Äôt be fair lol. 

Looking forward to the rest, thanks for sharing.
I did a blind tasting of C919 against the old 136 batch. 

I felt the differences were insignificant. I wouldn‚Äôt pay $200 secondary for the old batch against the newer bottle.
Can‚Äôt wait for the full series. Other than a couple of outliers (C919 being one) I am firmly in the ‚Äúold style bottles were consistently better‚Äù camp. But I did a single SBS [right here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/f62iid/reviews_107_and_108_elijah_craig_bp_showdown/) and new style beat old style.
What a great idea! Looking forward to all those reviews!
I have the C919 and it‚Äôs my first ever ECBP. I have to say I was disappointed. I have heard such great things and I really didn‚Äôt care for it. Does it need to sit for a bit?
Agreed, I was really hoping this one would do well in the blind tasting because I've been enjoying it a lot. I wasn't expecting it to be the very first one out the gate though.
Those other brands charge that because people are willing to pay it. It's a credit to heaven hill that they've kept the price the same for so long on such a hot product.
What batches have you liked? Also, happy cake day!
And I'm looking forward to posting them!
> Haven‚Äôt sbs‚Äôd it with other older batches because I feel it wouldn‚Äôt be fair lol.

Honestly that's been my experience with the newer ECBP's as well. They mostly haven't impressed me much compared to the older bottlings I've had. But that's partly why I wanted to do this blind comparison, to give them a fair shake and and see if it was just my bias against new stuff. Plus I hate the new bottle design.
I have 136 in this blind tasting, so we'll be able to see how these two compare. And yeah, I dont pay secondary price for anything. Most I've ever paid for an old batch was $80 at a store.
Thanks! I realized one day that I had a bunch of ECBP samples sitting around and a few bottles open so I got the idea. I opened up my older bottle, tracked down a few more samples, and here we are
Do you have much experience with Barrel Proof Bourbon? It is a pretty strong one. Or it might just not be your style, everyone's tastes are different. Definitely come back to it after giving it some time though, barrel proof stuff can change a lot after being open a while.
I haven‚Äôt had this batch but that‚Äôs been my experience with new label ECBP: it‚Äôs just not great immediately after opening except for the occasional batch that‚Äôs solid. I find it has an astringency and needs a ton of air. 

Old label however is just awesome from start to finish regardless of batch.
True. Take advantage while you can though. Who knows if or when that will change.  We've seen it recently with the HH 7 year BIB with the rebranding, A 1 year increase in age and $20+ increase in price.  ECBP at 12 years and barrel proof is kind of out of place price wise for them.
For me B518 has been my favorite of the ones I've had, A119 has been good as well. and thanks!
You‚Äôre doing god‚Äôs work.
I should have done that blind too.. great idea :)
Yes, I had a bottle of Stagg Jr right before I opened this one.  I‚Äôll give it a bit and try again.
Yes! Astringent that exactly the taste I‚Äôm getting! Ok, I‚Äôll let it sit for a bit and try again. Thanks.
I feel the same way about stagg jr, it's really good stuff but it can benefit from some air time. Give this one some time and you may come around.
Air should help. Give it some weeks/months."
A message from Buffalo Trace about operating during the pandemic,"This is an email I received from Buffalo Trace, thought I would share it here:

*****

Hello to old friends and new,
 
We thought long and hard about whether or not to send this update given the difficult times we are all experiencing, but on balance thought that sharing our resolve and actions during this crisis to carry on ‚Äì ‚ÄúHonoring Tradition, Embracing Change‚Äù ‚Äì would be appropriate.
 
First and most importantly, we hope that you and those closest to you are staying well and safe.  Please continue to put your health and safety first.
 
To say that the last month or so has been crazy might be a slight understatement!  It has echoes of the tradition for survival at the Distillery that our predecessors experienced during World War I, Prohibition, the Great Depression and World War II, all of which called for embracing rapid change and adaptation.  There have been downright scary days, nerve wracking moments, long hours and a lot of challenges but we are still ticking and determined to carry on no matter what the current challenge throws at us!
 
Our industry was deemed ‚Äúessential‚Äù early on in the crisis and I would like to recognize our entire 506 strong team for the wonderful way they have all pulled together, adapted to new health and safety standards to carry on distilling and warehousing record amounts of whiskey to ensure our future years' supply, met increased demand for our whiskey and other spirits as folks loaded up their pantries in advance of the lock downs, our grounds team for keeping the distillery looking ship shape as spring arrives, our hospitality team as they shut down tourism operations for the time being and redeployed themselves to giving virtual tours, and our community effort projects which has included producing and distributing hand sanitizer on an industrial scale.  To date, we have been able to supply over 70 million ounces of hand sanitizer from a position of having no clue what we were doing.  We are very happy to be able to help out with this crisis in a completely unexpected way.
 
In tribute to those who have lost their lives to Covid-19 our new event center ‚Äì The Stagg Lodge ‚Äì which overlooks the distillery from high on the hill at our farm is brightly lit in green as a beacon, please see photo in the montage below.
 
In this update we will tell you about:
 
-Making Hand Sanitizer
-Distillery Expansion and Cookers Update
-Warehouse Expansion Progress
-A new wastewater treatment facility
-Current Visitation Status, Recent Visitation and Visitor Center Expansion
-Charity Registration
-Growing Corn on our Farm
-Experimental Projects
-Recent Big Awards
-Events Update
 
In order to be email considerate, we have pasted a photo collage of a manageable size and attached the photo collage for those email accounts that prohibit embedded photographs.

**Making Hand Sanitizer**
 
On Friday, March 27, we began producing hand sanitizer at Buffalo Trace for some of the world‚Äôs largest organizations in healthcare, government, military, retail, distribution, airline, pharmacy, and banking industries.
 
Many of these organizations were and are desperate, as supplies have dwindled amid the COVID-19 crisis.
 
If your business or institution has a need for industrial hand sanitizer, please fill out this form https://forms.gle/ywtypRX5iDqBHbMS7 and someone from the distillery will get back to you.
 
The collage above features a photo of our first batch of hand sanitizer off our bottling line. You can also view a short clip of the bottling here.
 
 
**Distillery Expansion and Cookers Update**
 
Just before Christmas we started up our brand new, 22-foot cookers for the first time. A recap of this milestone can be viewed here. Four of these massive cookers, which are responsible for pressure cooking the milled grains before they are cooled and fermented, were installed last year over the summer and fall. The new cookers span three floors in height, and we had to remove the roof of our Mash House to lower them into the building.
 
Over the course of 2019, we reached several significant milestones in our ongoing $1.2 billion investment to make more whiskey and accommodate increased visitation.
 
Along with the cooker upgrade, we installed four new fermenters this past summer, after having to raise the roof by nine feet. The fermenters are 92,000 gallons a piece ‚Äì the same size as our other fermenters. Additionally, a new cooling tower, which cools down the grains after they are cooked into mash, was added.
 
But we‚Äôre not finished yet!
 
We are now gearing up to start Phase II of our Distillery expansion, which will take about two years to complete. This phase will include building a new Still House, new Dry House, new hammer mill and a new wastewater treatment facility. The prep work for this construction will kick off this summer. Stay tuned for more news about how this piece of the expansion progresses.
 

**Warehouse Update**
 
We continue to move right along on our warehouse expansion.
 
Warehouse EE, our fifth new warehouse built on our farm, is now full of barrels up to the sixth floor, and Warehouse FF is filled up to the third floor. Warehouses AA, BB, CC and DD are also filled.
 
We are almost finished with construction on Warehouse GG. The foundation of Warehouse HH has been poured and construction on the warehouse is about to begin. The ground is also now being prepared for Warehouses JJ and II.
 
These are the first of 22 new warehouses to be built on our farm over the next several years, each of which will hold 58,800 barrels.
 
You can view a current aerial photo of our warehouse construction in the collage above.
 

**New Wastewater Treatment**
 
We will soon be adding our own wastewater reclamation facility.  The new treatment facility will be comprised of a moving bed biofilm reactor and it will allow for the efficient treatment of wastewater so that the water quality standards are maintained.
 
It will take the Distillery‚Äôs process waste from our distilling, bottling, and process operations, treat it, and after disinfecting it, release it to Penitentiary Branch, which leads to the Kentucky River.
 
As a result, the reclamation facility will help assure the Penitentiary Branch and the Kentucky River remain high-quality waters.
 
The facility is expected to be completed in 2022, and is estimated to cost $30 million.
 

Current Visitation Status, Recent Visitation and Visitor Center Expansion
 
We have been closely following the global spread of COVID-19 which allowed us to refine and progressively implement our plans as incidence of the virus ramped up.
 
Consistent with guidance from public health authorities to limit large gatherings, and given that our tours include elements that bring large groups together, we announced in March that we were suspending all tours and visits to Buffalo Trace Distillery.
 
We understand this may be disappointing, and we apologize for the inconvenience. However, the health and safety of our team members and our visitors are of upmost importance to us. We look forward to resuming our tour operations in the near future and will notify the public on our social media accounts upon reopening.  We are currently working on our plan for how we will reopen for tours with the highest level of visitor and team member health and safety as the primary goal.
 
In the meantime, our visitor center staff is busy working in small teams to clean, organize, and sanitize our visitor operation, and we are tailoring our social media posts to provide our fans with a virtual experience of the Distillery. If you do not yet follow us, you can find us at Buffalo Trace Distillery on Facebook and @BuffaloTraceDistillery on Instagram.
 
We are featuring some of our talented tour guides who will be giving virtual tours of different parts of the Distillery, sharing virtual interactive tours, like this one led by our Freddie Johnson, cocktail recipes you can make at home, and plenty of great clips to binge watch during quarantine. Tour guide, Lee Cowherd explains our virtual experience plans in further detail here.
 
All of that said, we are excited to report that visitation to the Distillery, prior to this outbreak, continues to grow. We ended 2019 having welcomed a record-breaking 293,996 visitors during the calendar year. This is a 35 percent increase in visitation over the previous year, and a 466 percent increase since 2010!
 
Though we just completed an expansion of our Visitor Center in 2015, we are again expanding in order to accommodate the continued tourism growth.
 
This past fall, repairs, restoration and painting kicked off behind the back wall of our current Visitor Center where we are expanding further back into the current 1881 building. The fully expanded space will ultimately triple the size of the current Visitor Center.
 
The expanded Visitor Center will allow us to exhibit more of the distillery‚Äôs archives, and as the expanded space will back up to our recently completed fermenter expansion, the Visitor Center will have backdoor access to the whiskey making process, allowing for new and updated tour routes. The expanded space will also supply another event location for hosting evening parties and will give us more tasting space.
 
We anticipate the Visitor Center expansion to wrap up later this year.
 
For more information about our tours and for future reservations visit https://www.buffalotracedistillery.com/visit-us/our-tours, and until onsite tours resume, please enjoy our virtual experiences online and on social media.
 

**Charity Registration**
 
Over the years we have been delighted to work with a variety of non-profits to raise money for many worthy causes.
 
In 2011 we offered our Millennium Barrel of bourbon, put up to age on Dec. 31, 1999. That effort raised more than $150,000 for various charities across the U.S.
 
In 2016, our inaugural O.F.C. Bourbon Whiskeys from 1980, 1982 and 1983 were released in the same manner, and non-profits reported back they had raised more than a million dollars for charitable causes.
 
And last year, our commemorative bottling of our Buffalo Trace Sixth Millionth Barrel was made available only to non-profit organizations wishing to raise funds for charity.
 
We do not currently have any bottles available for charity fundraising but in order to better keep our non-profit partners informed of our periodic charitable offerings we encourage potential partners to register your cause through a new form on the Contact Us page of our website at https://buffalotracedistillery.com/content/charity-sign.
 

**Growing Corn on our Farm**
 
We planted and harvested two fields of Royal Blue corn and two fields of Hickory Cane White corn on our onsite ‚ÄúWhiskey Farm‚Äù last summer. That corn is still drying in our grain silo and will be cooked and fermented in late spring or early fall. We are now planning for this summer‚Äôs corn crop. Stay tuned to find out which variety of non-GMO corn we grow this year.

In the past we have grown Boone County White corn, Japonica Striped corn, CF790 Conventional corn and Neon Pink Popcorn.

Each crop harvested from our Whiskey Farm is distilled and aged on site to one day become expressions of ‚ÄúSingle Estate‚Äù bourbons. Name, age or price of this future bourbon is still to be determined.

Watch a short clip from this fall of the Royal Blue corn and Hickory Cane White corn harvest here.
 

**Experimental Projects**

In February we rolled newly filled barrels into Warehouse X. You can see photos of this in the collage above.

This marks the beginning of our third experiment inside Warehouse X, which will expand our temperature experiments by focusing on how temperature swings affect whiskey activity in the barrel. This will be a two-year experiment.

We also just acquired some old, and quite expensive Japanese Mizunara Oak barrels to age experimental whiskey. We purchased 34 of these barrels for $3,055 a piece! We have filled them and rolled them away to age, and look forward to monitoring the characteristics this particular type of oak imparts on the whiskey.

We are excited to currently have more than 30,000 barrels of experimental whiskey aging in our warehouses!
 

**Recent Awards**

We are honored to have been named the recipient of several recent awards.

Last month, the Icons of Whisky America Awards by Whisky Magazine named us the 2020 American Distiller of the Year and Visitor Attraction of the Year!

Then, we went on to be named the World Whiskies Awards Icons of Whisky Visitor Attraction of the Year, beating out competition from across the globe!

The magazine also awarded our E.H. Taylor, Jr. Straight Rye as the Best American Rye Whiskey of 2020.

Additionally, five other whiskies received medals at the American 2020 World Whiskies Awards.

Gold Medal Winners:
Buffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey
Colonel E.H. Taylor, Jr. Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey
Silver Medal Winners:
W. L. Weller 12 Year Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey
Elmer T. Lee Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey
Bronze Medal Winner:
W. L. Weller Full Proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey
 
**Events Update**

Due to the spread of COVID-19, and with the health and safety of our guests in mind, we canceled our Easter at the Trace event which had been scheduled for April 5th. We have also rescheduled our sold out Legendary Craftsmen Dinner featuring Sazerac Rye and Chef Nini Nguyen to Aug. 7th. As the Kentucky Derby has been postponed, our annual Oaks Day Festival is also in the process of being rescheduled.

We will update event dates under the Events section of our Facebook page, so mark yourself as ‚Äúinterested‚Äù in attending to receive notifications and event updates.

We look forward to getting through this outbreak and resuming our annual events soon. For the latest information regarding our scheduled events, and to learn more, please visit www.buffalotracedistillery.com/events.


**Future Updates**

Look for upcoming news about Phase II of our Distillery expansion, Visitor Center updates, our hand sanitizer operation and much more.
 
If we can be of any help at all with questions, needs, or wants please just reply to this e-mail and it will be personally answered.  If there are topics you would like to hear about from us, please do let us know that too.
 
In closing, I have always been struck by the scale of the challenges that our predecessors like Albert Blanton and Elmer T. Lee faced and in admiration of their handling of those challenges in ways that has allowed us to survive and prosper for more than 240 years.
 
At the onset of this crisis we took a very deep breath, leaned on our history and determined to honor their American grit, resolve and tradition while embracing the changes we faced, hopefully they would approve as we push through the current challenge to the days ahead when this crisis is firmly in the past. 
 
Thank you for taking the time to be a part of our journey.  Onwards!

Let me know when they get to Warehouse AAAAH
Remember folks...Bourbon is like Purell for your insides!  ;-)
All this, and I still can‚Äôt get a bottle of pappy.
 I‚Äôve been trying to get a hold of them to see if they needed any supply chain help. Especially distributing the hand sanitizer. 
If anyone has any information on the person who does supply chain and logistics please let me know. 
Thanks
Did anyone else read that and get super excited about the Japanese Mizunara oak barrels they purchased??
Buffalo Trace is the best whiskey I have ever tasted.
Good share, thank you! I wonder what they mean by ""Old Mizunara Oak Barrels"", do they mean the oak itself is old? or the barrels are used? It would be neat if they came here and did an AMA on just this mail.
Thats ALOT to read. Can anyone tell me if those hand sanitizer bottles will be distributed like their normal bottles are? Would be a nice wwy to actually get it to consumers across the nation.
This is pretty much my plan haha. I don't bother hunting or seeking out these unicorn bottles and I refuse to pay $50+ for a 1oz pour, so I'm hoping to finally try some of this stuff in 10-15 years when production and aged stock catches up with demand.
We did the hardhat tour back in February and it was really cool to see the new silos and cookers up close/personal. 

It's even more impressive considering they are a historic landmark so they have to maintain the structures on site as is (hence removing roofs for access) as they can't change the structure of the existing landmark.
>BuffaloTraceDistillery

Scrolled down for this.  Thanks.
Only if it's above 60 percent ABV!
I can‚Äôt even get EH Taylor or Weller, let alone anything in the Van Winkle lineup.
While BT produces the van winkle line, The van winkle family still owns the brand and makes all decisions about production and marketing. Also have to remember that they have to make production decisions about 15 years ahead of time. That long ago pappy was collecting dust on liquor store shelves.
I just want some eagle rare!
it's almost as if the scarcity is intentional
You're welcome! I'm bad about checking my email so I actually didn't see this til a day or two after I got it. I'm surprised no one had posted it yet, I can't be the only guy getting BT emails right? I've had similar experiences posting other BT emails in the past.

I don't know much about Mizanura oak, but I looked it up and it does look interesting. It needs to be 200 years old before it can even be used for making barrels?!?! Holy shit. It's probably going to be some crazy limited bottling I'll never see or try anyway lol
No plans right now. They are all going to first responders for now
Go to their gift shop website. They have started shipping their 1.75 L hand sanitizer to the public. Some liquor and hand sanitizer is also available for pick up ONLY.
I feel like the marketing won‚Äôt change. Scarcity drives demand for those higher end bottles, and the resulting prestige makes product that‚Äôs more forgiving to produce that much more attractive. BT releasing substantially more WLW, GTS and ER17 seems like it would just be shooting themselves in the foot.
Well, I can‚Äôt get those either.

The volume of production they are capable of is astounding.
My local stores have this always in stock. Shit they even have the handle and regular 750ml sizes most of the time
It's almost as if BTAC and PVW sat on the shelf for months 10 years ago, and it suddenly got popular, and there is now way to make whiskey age 15 years in a couple months to keep supply up with demand.
Yeap, pretty much. Just look at the volume their warehouses can hold, how much space they are adding, and they only have 34 Mizunara barrels. Interesting product, but were very likely not going to see it on shelves.
That means the volume we imbibe is astounding, especially in the past month or so!
I think you bring up a good point. On the other hand, I can find Springbank releases that they only produced 9000 bottles of pretty regularly. From memory, I believe GTS have had batches close to 37000-40000 bottles...?
I'll just be happy if I can buy some ORVW off the shelf someday
You gotta remember most of this stuff ages 4-10 years or more. So we are still imbibing 2010-2016 production levels or older. There is a good amount of lag time between these new higher Production levels and actually seeing more on the shelf. Its also a gamble on their part, they are counting on demand staying high for years down the road.
There's a lot of variety of high end scotch, and the demand hasn't fluctuated dramatically recently. There was almost no market for high end American whiskey until a few years ago. I remember being able to get GTS and other BTAC off the shelf for $60 in the early 2010s. 

BT produced BTAC in order to meet the demand they expected. 10 years ago people were giving away stocks of old whiskey to private bottlers for nothing. Now you can't even get MGP. The market had a sudden, unexpected surge in demand. And it's not as product you can make quickly to meet demand. It's as simple as that.
I think part of the reason is that you pay for what you get with scotch.  GTS retails for $90 for a 15 year cask strength whiskey which is really a fantastic value.  What if BT decided to charge $400 a bottle? I'd say it would be a bit easier to find a bottle.
I still think its a ways away, but with any luck someday! Im waiting for Weller 12 to return in greater numbers as a sign of increased production.
I'm counting on a glut down the road.
The Springbank/longrows that have that lower number of bottles produced are generally bottled at cask strength. You're right about the lower price being a big contributor on the scarcity."

*****

**Caol Ila 18 Unpeated 2017, 59.8%**

**Nose:** Rich, malty, briny, sweet, this is a fucking beautiful malt bomb on the nose. Thick THICK pastry malt, rich caramel and tons of sea salt, thick vanilla pudding, grassy barley, sweet grain sugars, warm lemon, musty wood, so much thick delicious caramel malt. 

**Taste:** The flavor builds huge with thick pastry and caramel malt, smooth deep wood spice, dark toasted wood, cocao, a deliciously clean and drawn out ocean brine, luxurious caramel, sweet pastry and dark vanilla. Like the nose it's just gorgeous. So thick and malty with lots of straightforward yet extremely well executed flavor, just the right amount of dessert sweetness and woody kick. It feels stoic and dignified like a statue come to life.

**Finish:** Sweet and briny, with thick clean malt and beautifully charred smoke. Lingers with a malty sweetness and mouth-numbing charred menthol similar to a heavily peated Islay.

*****

This is a beautiful Scotch. As much as I love a proper Islay peat monster, this is of a much higher quality than almost any peated Scotch I've had from Caol Ila. It's a rich and luxurious malt bomb which is a style I love but seems hard to pull off well. It's so simple that it's deceptively difficult to pull off I think, the Barley malt and wood have to be well balanced and speak for itself without any outside help from wine or smoke flavor. This does it about as well as any malty Scotch I've ever had.

I love this whiskey, but my wife hated when I drank it because it made the whole house smell of iodine.
Really wish they would make unpeated Caol Ila a regular release instead of just one-offs. It‚Äôs clearly high quality stuff, even without this much age on it.
Jerry Thomas kept barrels in his cellar, so I hear.
Great review.  I love these unpeated caol ilas.  They can be great whiskies.
Is this difficult to find?  I do not recall seeing this at my local store.
Ohio had some version of these delisted last year and on sale on a deep discount, for 60-70 bucks I want to say.  Major regret in me not buying them now.
I cannot wait to get a bottle of this.
Had the peated version in Scotland last November. It‚Äôs my favorite whisky I‚Äôve ever tasted.
ahhh love this! tried it in Glasgow Bon Accord!
Awesome review of an awesome whisky. This is one of my all-time favourites, glad to see someone else enjoy it as much as I did!!
This sounds truly lovely.  Do you know what it MSRPs for State side?
Are you sure you aren't talking about the standard 12 year? That's usually more of a thing with heavily peated Scotch like their standard 12 year, this one is an unpeated special release.
Have you had any other of these unpeated releases? I'm dying to know if these are pretty consistent with this kind of quality because I want one. I will have to check out some other reviews.
If only they could pull a Tobermory/Ledaig and do both somewhat regularly. The production demands probably don't allow for much more than what they do, though, given how much they make for blends.
It's a limited bottling, I think they only release it once a year
Oh damn that's rough man, I'm sorry
Thanks! I love a good malt bomb, and this is about as good a malt bomb as you could hope for. It seems like such  simple thing, I think something like 90% of all Scotch is aged in Bourbon barrels but it's difficult to find something this good. 

Have you had any of the other unpeated releases? It looks like there's other releases floating around out there that are 12, 15, 17 years old, are they pretty consistent with this kind of quality?
A quick search shows about $100-$125
Actually you might be right. Seeing again that this was the 18 it‚Äôs unlikely I would have shelled out for that blind.
I liked the 12 Year/2010 a lot, but the 14 Year/2012  was a little over oaked. Even then the underlying spirit was clearly very good.

http://cocktailchem.blogspot.com/2016/10/whisky-review-caol-ila-14-year-unpeated.html

I also have a sample of the 15 Year/2016 and a bottle of the 18 Year/2017 that I‚Äôm hoping to do head to head.
If I'm not mistaken, this is often the Caol Ila entry of the Diageo special releases they do every year (when they have a Caol Ila in the lineup). Sometimes they also do a super aged Caol Ila, too.
I'm with you, malt bombs are life.

I've tried [the 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/ah6pzk/review_232_caol_ila_17_unpeated_2015_release/
), which was great but not stellar like this 18, and [the 15](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/d5yvz9/review_362_caol_ila_15_unpeated_2018_release/
), which was incredibly disappointing.
That makes sense then. That 12 year is great stuff too, and yes the whole room will know what you are drinking when you pour it haha. Gotta love that Islay peat
The 15 is also delicious, but the 18 is a bit better, I'd really like to try the 17...
Those look great, glad to see the quality has been there for some time. I guess I'm looking for something more recent though that I can still find. I'd love to see that head to head!
I might have to give the 17 a try, I can't seem to find the 18 anywhere. 

>I'm with you, malt bombs are life.

As long as we're on the subject, any other recommendations? The last one I had that impressed me this much was a Glenmorangie Astar 52.5%, delicious malt. That r/Scotch Wardhead 22 is another good one.
It's not exactly the most attainable whisky, but [that one Brora](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/aa16p8/review_213_brora_18_old_malt_cask_1981_birthday/?
) I tried had the most gorgeous barley sugar note right down the middle, surrounded by smoke and spice. I haven't tried the Astar, but [Ealanta](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/d0x7cj/review_357_glenmorangie_ealanta/
) and [Allta](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/edc573/review_405_glenmorangie_allta/
) were both pretty great, worth seeking out at least a sample of. I could list loads of Springbanks or Bruichladdichs too.
>To nobody‚Äôs surprise, it‚Äôs delicious.

Lol I love it, and wow what a killer price. I mean if we're going that route, yeah Brora is [amazing stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/c7o7z8/review_100_brora_35_2013_release/) but I meant something more attainable. Totally agree on Bruichladdich, their malt can be divine. I need to try the Organic bottling, that one in particular looks really good and has gotten some amazing reviews. And I love Springbank, but I kind of consider them it's own thing somewhere between Islay and ""malt bomb.""

Also, cheers fellow December baby! I'm December 15th"

*****

**George Dickel 9 Single Barrel, Thunder Road, 51.5%**

**Nose:** I don't have a lot of experience with Dickel Bourbon, but oh my god I totally get the Flintstone vitamins everyone always talks about lol. It's like a flinty and chalky candy sweetness, but kind of artificial. Marshmallow, bubble gum, smarties candy, lots of vanilla, sour wood, chocolatey toasted char. It's such a funky chalky sweetness, it's like a bad smell that you somehow enjoy.

**Taste:** Cola and hot cherry, chalky flintstone vitamins, delicious Bourbon corn, vanilla, caramel sweetness, nice balanced herbal spice. It has that artificial chalky flintstone vitamin mouthfeel, but it doesn't take over. It's balanced nicely with a more standard kind of hot and zingy herbal Bourbon, very unique in my experience. Overall it's well executed even if it is a bit weird.

**Finish:** Lots of spice, Bourbony corn and hot cherry that trails off into some smooth chalky and musty mouthfeel, man that's different til the end.

*****

I try not to let popular opinion around here influence my tastes too much, but holy shit the Flintstone Vitamins were strong with this one and I finally see what everyone is talking about. It's not just the flavor it's the chalky and artificial feel of it. I can't say I love that particular note but it's so interesting and unique that it's oddly compelling. There's lots of delicious Bourbony flavor here as well and I feel like it's all pretty well executed and balanced overall. I really enjoyed the experience but I'm not sure I would want a bottle.

Nice review. Sounds pretty good. I've been curious to try one of these since they increased the proof. I have a bottle of their 13 year BiB I'll be opening eventually. Haven't tried any Dickel OB stuff yet, just some Pursuit Series, which I liked.
I want some of this. Love the BiB 13 yo. 'Oddly compelling' is the right thinking here. Thanks for the review.
I wasn't aware of a proof increase. This sample is about a year and a half old fwiw. 

I think the only other Dickel Bourbon I've had was a 13yr Smooth Ambler SiB, it was good but kind of ordinary. This one was weirder for sure and maybe not even as good but it has more character for sure.
Yea I think these used to be 86 peoof.
I'm a big fan of the Dickel 13 Year BiB, but I definitely see why some people would be put off by the blend of Flintstones vitamins and Sweet Tarts I get from it.  I just think it wonderfully morphs into all the classic bourbon flavors once you get past the initial mineral flavor and it has a real nice finish. 

I highly recommend giving it a shot if you see it.  It's retails for about 36 bucks, so even if you don't love it it's not a rip-off.

Review 145: Laphroaig 18 Signatory Cask Strength,,https://i.redd.it/l1fikfh1l3t41.jpg,"Courtesy of u/HawkI84

*****

**Laphroaig 18 1997 Signatory Cask Strength #8370, Hogshead, 51.2%**

**Nose:** Tons of strong medicinal peat and crisp powerful brine, black liquorice, fresh wood, light sweet caramel, light vanilla, fresh floral notes. It's a very crisp and clean kind of floral peat with huge coastal brine and a light wood influence, Really nice and interesting nose.

**Taste:** It pretty much picks up where the nose left off. Clean and powerful briny peat, sweet vanilla, perfumy floral notes, mean coastal brine, peppery heat, settles into smooth chocolatey smoke in the Highland style. The light, sweet complexity and floral notes remind me of a well aged older Scotch, but it still has tons of mean briny peat that hasn't been softened by age.

**Finish:** Strong briny smoke with richer chocolate and vanilla, strong perfumy floral notes and black liquorice. The clean and crisp medicinal peat lingers forever, beautiful.

*****

Laphroaig rarely disappoints, and this is no exception. It has elements of an older, more delicate and complex Scotch with the light sweetness and floral notes but still has tons of strong briny and medicinal Laphroaig peat that hasn't lost it's edge with time. If anything the peat just tastes more refined, sharp, and crystal clear. This stuff is a different take on Laphroaig than I'm used to, but it still reminds me how much I fucking love the stuff. And that's a success in my book.

I‚Äôm wondering if there is a huge difference to the 10 years one
How do you pronounce this? Is it laugh-roig(rhymes with roid)?
I have a bottle of the 18 year unopened, prob end up saving it and selling it in 10 years. This year is discontinued and you can‚Äôt find it anywhere for what I paid ($150).
Glad you liked it. I enjoyed it a lot, but there were a couple other Signatory Laphroaig's I had in their mid-teens that I preferred, due to bigger fruit notes. This had an almost fresh, clean take on Laphroaig, that was kind of like the 2013 25 I had a while back.
Not sure, I haven't had the 16yr. But being cask strength this one is probably a little better and more powerful.
https://youtu.be/LanWn7DvSlU
Yeah I've got one too, I remember when they went for around $100. Think I got mine for $120
>This had an almost fresh, clean take on Laphroaig

Totally agree. I dont think I've ever had such a floral and clean Laphroaig or even islay before, but it didnt sacrifice or soften the frog peat that I love so much. Real interesting stuff.
Just found some yesterday, he had two but wanted $399 each! I bargained with him for 30 mins and he wouldn‚Äôt come off of it. I even offered $1000 for his talisker 1985 (27 year) and the 18 year laphroaig and he wouldn‚Äôt take it."
"Review 144: Glendroncah 19 Single Cask #4943, Oloroso 56.9%",,https://i.redd.it/rqdp56i2qfs41.jpg,"Courtesy of u/nsquare14

*****

**Glendronach 19 Single Cask # 4943, Oloroso, 56.9%**

**Nose:** Sweet malty and woody barrel notes. Tons of vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, maple syrup, sweet barrel char, lots wonderful toasted wood, cake frosting and pastry malt. There's a real disconnect between the sweet, malty nose and the deep sherry color on this stuff. Sweet candy strawberry and lightly rich plum are there, but it's not a real heavy sherry presence.

**Taste:** Bolder, darker, and more tannic than the nose. Dark fruits, burnt plum, dark strawberry sweetness, tannic wood, leather, dark rich caramel, dark earthy sweetness, big hot spice kick. Delicious flavor but a little dark and monotone after the sweet and complex nose. The heavy wood notes and spice are really nice and interesting though.

**Finish:** The gritty, earthy-fruity sweetness builds brighter with lots of caramel, maple, hot peppery spice, leaves with some bitter wood and sweet strawberry. 

*****

A solid bottle, but unfortunately it couldn't totally live up to it's wonderful nose for me. It smells like a full on sweet Bourbon barrel malt bomb with maybe a light sherry finish, which is totally a style I love. The flavor is more classically Glendronach sherry-bomb, although there's still a lot of tannic wood and caramel here compared to other single casks I've tried. Those tannic and woody notes can sometimes take over and get too astringent in a Scotch, but it's handled well here and makes for an interesting cask.

Great nose then something very different in the taste and I‚Äôm never looking for those bitter notes in the finish. This one is kind of all over the place. Great review, you really had to work for it. That nose though, ah.
Yeah I try to let a dram breath for a minute before diving in, but I might still nose it a bit. And this one had me excited, such a unique nose for a Glendronach. It's still a delicious Scotch, just couldn't quite live up. 

I should add that the bitterness was more of a woody thing and not a bitter wine note. Seems like a fine distinction I know, but the latter is much worse to me. Funky sherry notes are just the worst. This was a little more interesting and unique
The nose sounded just great. Each 3 parts sound really good but not quite all working together. Interesting sounding dram though. 

That kind of a bitterness isn‚Äôt too bad. Kind of oaky tannic? Agreed on funky sherry notes. They can go south in a hurry.

So, anything new? I picked up a bottle of Kilchoman STR Red wine cask aged. Kind of an impulse buy. Sounds like it should be good though. How about you?
I'm fascinated by the whole recharred barrel thing, that sounds really cool. Can't wait to hear your thoughts!

I've been getting into Armagnac a lot actually. I bought like 4 bottles last week, I've opened 3 and they are fucking fantastic. It's really incredible stuff.

Rum a little bit too. I'm not usually a big Rum fan but t8ke and some others have been doing some really good picks. Not sure if you caught this one or not:

Correct. It's the discontinued sourced stuff which is Indiana distilled MGP Rye, 7 years old and 99 proof. The Willett Single Barrel is also sourced MGP Rye, it's some of my favorite stuff.

Review #143: Caol Ila 10 G&M refill sherry 59% Binny's Selection,,https://i.redd.it/k5m69dc7zor41.jpg,"Courtesy of u/HawkI84

*****

**Caol Ila 10 Gordon and Macphail Binny's selection, refill sherry, 59%**

**Nose:** Gritty char, huge briny and medicinal peat, vanilla, rich toasted wood, chocolate cherries, menthol, cola char. There's some bright tart fruits at first but it melds into a chocolatey-sweet tart cherry fruitiness. Delicious nose, it's a charred medicinal peat monster first and foremost.

**Taste:** Thick and peaty, sweet vanilla, drying tart fruits like strawberry and cherry, with thick sludgy peat, sulfur sweetness, chocolate, dark tart cherry, hot spice builds. It's sulfury and sludgy and peaty, the charred Islay peat and thick tart fruits both stay defined and well balanced but combine well into a monster of flavor.

**Finish:** Chocolate, bright sulfury sweet and tart sherry, tons of proper Islay briny peat that builds huge and lingers forever(like only Islay peat can)

*****

It's a proper briny and ashy peat with a thick tart fruitiness, combines into this thick and sludgy monster. The sherry influence is just about perfect here. It has just the right amount of sulfur, tartness and sweetness without any of it going overboard or feeling too ""wine-y."" It compliments and adds to the delicious Islay character without feeling like it's competing for attention.

**Nose:** Creamy and darkly sweet wood notes. Caramel and rich luxurious honey, toffee cream, vanilla, light apple fruit, deliciously tannic and nutty toasted wood, smooth milk chocolate. It's like a nutty toffee dream

**Taste:** Dark nutty sweetness but a little more delicate than the nose. Sweet rich caramel and nuts like an ice cream topping, toffee malt, some berry fruits, smooth tannic wood, sweet vanilla and oak char, dark peppery spices

**Finish:** Bright woody caramel and vanilla with some fiery spice and sweet charred oak

*****

A sweet and woody Scotch, it pulls of some odd flavors pretty well but it might not be for everyone. It's on the tannic and bitter side but it's not a mess, it incorporates the flavor nicely and makes for an interesting and unique experience. Nutty and woody but in a sweet and creamy kind of way. Makes me wonder what the deal is with the French Oak finish, was it virgin wood maybe? Not something I would buy, or reach for very often, but it was a fun pour.

Cool! Sounds interesting, I do like french oak.
It struck me as something I might want to add water to, but I never feel brave enough to try it on a sample. Besides, I usually find if I add water it's because I don't love it and I'm attempting to improve it and it usually doesn't help.
[deleted]
So do you have any other info on the French oak here? Was it some kind of wine cask, or virgin oak?
[deleted]
Makes sense, because I didn't get any wine from it. I don't think I've had a virgin oak Scotch before but I would expect it to be a little heavier than this. But then again a year isn't a super long time"

**Taste:** The tart fruits open up more warm and friendly with rich woody caramel, vanilla, rich dark baked malt, sweet icing and pastry, musty toasted oak. Very clean and even mouthfeel, the flavors stay thick but balanced and unfold nicely.

Delicious entry level bottle from this distillery, pretty impressive stuff. It's malty and fruity and just a tad on the richer/darker side, but in a delicious sweet woody caramel kind of way. I usually prefer my malt bombs a little brighter and more ""happy"" but this is really doing it for me. I've also had a chance to try the PX and Bordeaux special releases which were both cask strength, age stated, a decent price, and delicious so I'm digging this distillery lately.

I really like Deanston. 
For what the bottles cost; they‚Äôre really good!

I‚Äôve tasted the virgin cask, the 12y and have recently bought the 10yr Bordeaux Cask.
Great review. This is really good stuff. It's an easy sipper.  *It smells like apple pie with perfectly baked crust and covered in rich caramel,* yup, you nailed it. I've only had the 12 but am thinking I need to try more of what they have to offer. LOL on your poster comment below. That goes without saying!
Great review, really enjoy Deanston - need to get a bottle of the 12 for my collection. Really, really enjoyed their warehouse tasting!
I can totally see why
Thanks, and agreed!
Nice! Interesting fact, having this up in my living room/dining room is how you can tell I'm a bachelor
Thanks! I've been really impressed with Deanston, everything has been really good. The fact that they rebranded with higher ABV, NCF, age statements and interesting casks shows they are taking pride in their product and it shows. It's like a Highland Bruichladdich.

I've had the 10yr PX and 9yr Bordeau, both of which are cask strength, they were both delicious

**Knob Creek Single Barrel, El Cerrito Liquor barrel #3868, 13 years 60%**

**Nose:** Smooth tannic and spicy oak, so much delicious oak, dark caramelized brown sugar, metallic cherry and corn, tons of cool Rye spice, wood must, chocolate, nutty caramel, vanilla. Super oaky and sweet

**Taste:** Hits huge with sweet, deeply charred oak and tons of spice. It's delicious, the best way to describe it is ""bright oak"" or maybe ""lively oak."" Dark caramel sweetness, hot zingy cherry, lively Rye spice, Bourbon corn, cinnamon, deep toasted oak. Very lively and complex, the oaky sweetness and spice is all vying for attention and it's just so much fun.

**Finish:** Oak spice and cherry cinnamon zings on the finish, settles into sweet charred oak and rye spice. A long and complex finish.

*****

Great fucking stuff, and a lot of fun. Tons of delicious oak, but it's not a dark and tannic oakiness that feels bogged down and oak-heavy. It's a fierce and lively oak, a bright oakiness, with tons of complex sweetness and crazy spice. I hesitate to use the word ""balanced"" because that sounds boring, it's complex and lively but it flows together nicely. It's like a controlled detonation, it explodes but doesn't get too harsh or out of control. I'm not very experienced with Knob Creek single barrels but this makes me want to try more.

Looks nice..l
Great review, I have tried a few of these lately and I can really relate to your description of the oak on the palette and the finish. I can taste the char on the barrel in a couple of these and it‚Äôs not a bad thing. I like going back and forth from one barrel to the next to compare flavors. 

Any idea when they stopped using these name plates? Also, have you tried calling the store and asking for age/rickhouse info?

Cheers!
KC store picks are usually great. That 'bright oak' note sounds tasty
I grabbed a store pick of this on a whim last month. Small Batch is one of my go-to's ($35 a bottle at Costco, cannot complain at all). I didn't like it initally, but after some more pours I've come to like it almost as much as Rare Breed
Yeah it is, I need to try some more for sure
I pick these KC store picks up whenever I see them. Totally agree with you guys.
I haven‚Äôt had one that was. My least favorite big brand by far. To each their own
Oh it is..l
Thanks, and yeah the huge oak in these is very distinct and delicious, it doesn't really do the experience justice to simply call it an ""oak bomb."" A lot more going on.

I forgot to mention it in the review but this stuff is apparently 13 years old, a pretty standard age for these. I think they stopped doing those little name plates somewhat recently, in the last year or so. This bottle is about 3 years old.

Review #140: Dalmore 13 Dun Bheagan 54.3%,,https://i.redd.it/mdiyserdpnp41.jpg,"Bottled by Ian Macleod for the Dun Bheagan range, and finished in Pomerol Wine casks. Courtesy of u/unbreakablesausage

*****

**Dalmore 13 Dum Bheagan, 54.3%**

**Nose:** Soft red fruits, orange, dark caramel, chocolate, smooth toasted wood, malt. It's wine-heavy and very reminiscent of a sherried nose, but much softer and friendlier. I like it

**Taste:** Soft tart fruits, strawberry and orange, it's fruity but in a very smooth and soft way. Rich caramel, chocolate, lively malt, vanilla, wood funk. Does a really good job of integrating the wine finish with Scotchy caramel and barrel notes, it's all very rich and balanced with a smooth, even mouthfeel.

**Finish:** Bright tart berries and sweet vanilla icing with some gentle ginger spice

*****

This is tasty. Wine finishes can easily take over and go awry, so I'm often skeptical of IB's or single casks with odd wine finishes. But this has integrated really nicely and it's kind of interesting and unique. The wine has a strong presence but remains very soft and inoffensive, still plenty of rich malt and smooth chocolatey barrel notes as well. This is my second IB Dalmore and they've both been really good

I'm not crazy about this one. Found it very wine-heavy as well, and I felt like I wanted more of the malt. Sometimes I'm in the mood for it; other times not so much.
Where does one find these small sample bottles? I see them a lot here and on youtube but don't know where to get one.
I find the wood in this one pretty overwhelming, in a bad way. This was like a 4 for me.

But just another example that individual's taste differ, sometimes significantly.

I liked 2004 Dalmore Chieftain's Choice 13yr Pomerol Wine Finish 54.5% significantly more.
Yeah you definitely have to be in the mood for the wine, it is heavy for being just a finish. I just thought it was really interesting compared to sherry, seemed softer somehow
They are 2oz Boston Rounds, you can buy them on Amazon or other online retailers. Some of us are in groups that use the rounds to trade samples from our collection with each other
Wow, I didn't know there were all these different options for Pomerol finished Dalmore
ok that makes sense. thank you.

"A discontinued bottle kill, one less of these in the world",,https://i.redd.it/r09tnbyywhp41.jpg,"I did t realize they stopped making this. I still have about a quarter of mine from when they first released it in ‚Äò06
Yep. They switched to some other NAS Nadurra bottlings, a sherried bottle, a virgin oak, a peated I think. But the 16yr was discontinued years ago.
What do you think of it?
I love it. Glenlivet 12 was my first single malt and I still enjoy it, and this stuff is basically the same profile but on steroids. It's 100% Bourbon barrel so you get all the delicious Glenlivet malt and green apple but at 16 years, barrel proof, and no chill-filtration. With a coupon I used to get these for about $60-$70, it was a crazy deal so it was never gonna last. Luckily I still have a few more stashed

Damn sounds like a banger. I remember this was what people raved about a couple of year back when I was still very fresh to whisky. I snagged a bottle on the cheap in the secondary market and was waiting to crack such a special bottle to me.

Great review too btw!
Right on, and thanks! There is definitely some batch variation with some being better than others, but I've never had one I didn't like."
Review #143: Rock Hill Farms,,https://i.redd.it/7sy93oc29hp41.jpg,"Courtesy of u/washeewashee

*****

**Rock Hill Farms Single Barrel, 50%**

**Nose:** Deep tannic oak, creamy brown sugar and honey, toffee, smooth tobacco, vanilla, dark cherry. Sweet and tannic woody nose with a smooth presentation

**Taste:** Smooth tannic oak, oak spice, cherry, honey caramel, vanilla. Sweet and tannic like the nose, but with more spice. Despite the strong flavors and high ABV it has a very tame and ""dry"" feel to it, doesn't explode or ooze on the palate like it should.

**Finish:** Dark wood notes of tobacco, oak, vanilla and char with dark cherry sweetness and some mild spice. Kind of quick.

*****

I've gone through a bottle of this before and it just never really did a whole lot for me. This sample was a revisit, to see how I like it after several years and many other Bourbons. I think I enjoyed this more than I remember, but it's still kind of forgettable for me. It's a little too dry and tannic for my taste, although it does feel balanced and well-crafted. I never cared much for Blanton's either, so I think I'm just not a big fan of this Buffalo Trace mashbill #2. But it's definitely gone up a point in my book since last time.

6?!..... Six? smh
Fantastic review. One thing I need to keep reminding myself when having drams of these is that a lot of these products are single barrel bottlings (even though they might not label which barrel) & so although the overall generic profile of them should be similar, there are barrel variances that might make one bottle better than another. That plus air time, palate preferences, etc.
I take it you disagree
Thanks dude! I was thinking about that as well, but I'm thinking there's not really a whole lot of variation with bottlings like these. It's hard to tell by reviews anyway, you can have two people drink from the same bottle and get different experiences.
Nice review, but I'm a bit surprised by the 6 as well. While I tend to gravitate toward higher proofs this is pretty much the pinnacle of the 100 proof and below of buffalo Trace offerings. I'd have to do a side by side between my bottle of EHT Sib and RHF.

I'd probably bump it up to at least a 7.

You need a bottle or two to really dive into it on multiple occasions. 

If you ever visit Chicago I know a guy...lol
Well, everyone has different tastes right? I have gone through a bottle before actually, and I never really liked it then either. I actually came around a little and felt like I could appreciate it's quality more this time compared to the bottle I had, but it just doesn't do a lot for me. Like Blanton's, I've passed it up several times even when I had a chance to buy it at MSRP. 

>this is pretty much the pinnacle of the 100 proof and below of buffalo Trace offerings

I'd personally give that to CEHT
I totally agree on the different palates. 

Good review and keep them coming"

*****

**Ledaig 16 1994, Gordon & Macphail ""Connoisseur's Choice"" 43%**

**Nose:** Wet wood, chocolate, charred tannic oak, mild smoke, vanilla, sulfur. Oaky and tannic with nice chocolatey smoke

**Taste:** Caramel, chocolate, oak, smooth mild smoke, vanilla, slight bitterness and tart berry

**Finish:** Light chocolate and vanilla with some mild sweet charred smoke and medicinal notes. 

*****

There's some nice stuff going on but it's just a wee bit heavy on the bitter oak notes. It starts to detract from the nicer smoke and chocolate notes, but not enough to ruin it luckily. More oak than smoke I would say. Nothing I would want a bottle of (even at a decent price) but it's enjoyable.

Are you sure about the ABV? I thought the Connoisseurs Choice line was at least 46%, with the newer ones at cask strength.
All I have to go by is the label on the sample, and it is definitely written clearly as 43%. u/ODMBitters seems to be MIA these days so who knows. I found this bottle which may or may not be this stuff, but it's 43%: https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PtDf1wm1LtY/WA-NymQIjbI/AAAAAAAAEJ8/h-ZQd5hM0ScmU0GX8kkePMXcRNgsB_HOQCLcB/s1600/G%2526M%2BLedaig%2B16%2BYear%2B1994%253A2011.jpg
At least it's clear that there are Connoisseurs Choice bottles that are 43%. I stand corrected.
I was thinking you were onto something before I found the picture, because the flavor was there enough that it could pass for 46%. So I learned something new today as well.
I always had the impression that the Connoisseurs Choice label was a step up from the MacPhail's Collection, Discovery, and Distillery Labels series, which are all 43%. I guess that isn't always the case. Way to add confusion..."
Review #18: Connemara Irish Peated Single Malt,,https://i.redd.it/gnxhx59anbp41.jpg,"Courtesy of u/ODMBitters

*****

**Connemara Irish peated Single Malt, 40%**

**Nose:**Lovely nose of smooth heavy peat, honey, barrel char, chocolate, brine, vanilla. It noses like a proper Islay, maybe a bit smooth and simple but delicious

**Taste:** Oh joy, the taste doesn't let you down after the nice nose. Caramel and honey sweetness, vanilla, sweet heavy peat, smooth milk chocolate, light gritty char. It does really well with the low ABV, moderately rich and flavorful. Nothing off-putting here even if it is a bit simple.

**Finish:** Sweet vanilla and easy peat, light char and brine. Proper Islay notes but mild and smooth.

*****

It's a familiar kind of sweet Bourbon barrel Islay peat, and it does a really nice job at 40%. Smooth and accessible with some moderately rich flavor. It has a nice smooth chocolate feel with loads of vanilla and strong briny peat. This might easily compete with entry-level Islay bottles like Frog 10, Laga 16, Caol Ila 12 if it were bottled at 43-46%. Pleasantly surprised for a 40% Irish Whiskey, but then again I am a sucker for peat.

Wow, your blinds look great through the Glencairn glass
I‚Äôm just on the fence with Irish whiskey but you‚Äôre making this sound pretty good. A friend gave me a bottle of CS heavily peated Connemara about 10 years ago. I had a couple of drams then, wasn‚Äôt really what I expected and hadn‚Äôt worked out what I liked or didn‚Äôt like and why. So a long story short (too late for that) I stuck it in the back of my whisk(e)y closet. Great review as always and I think it‚Äôs time to dig out and give that bottle another try.
Once again I'm jealous not just of your collection, but your friends as well. This one isnt really a bottle I would buy for myself, but it's a great peated whisky for beginners I think. Curious how a CS would do, love to hear your thoughts on it. If you review it tag me, I dont check this sub a lot. 

Did you see my review for amrut peated CS? Holy shit now that stuff was a beast and I want some. 

Are you on discord? What's your name over there?
Thanks, good buds - whisky friends are the best. It's really a plot we have, they give me whisky and we have to drink it, then I have to pay them back so, I give them whisky, and we have to drink it...... the wife's are like, oh, it's great the guys have a hobby they all like and do together, great bonding,  just keep it quite. 

I don't really remember much of that CS Connemara so I will have to give it a try again. I don't go this sub very much either. I didn't see your review for amrut peated CS, I'll look it up.

Not on discord. What is it?
Discord is a social network app, it's basically like a messaging/chat thing. T8ke and other Redditors run an Aficianado server over there, it was formed in the aftermath of r/Scotchswap getiting shut down. It's a lot of familiar faces from Reddit over there. I don't really use it, but I check it out sometimes and for some reason I thought you might be on there with a different username."

Total rum noob here, but I had to grab a few of these rum bottles from FineDrams after loving some samples I tried. I'm not sure what the deal is with this stuff, I believe it's some kind of unusual rum that isn't usually bottled on it's own like this. It's high ester, but to be perfectly honest I don't know what that means so hopefully someone can explain it to me. 

*****

**DOK Trelawny Jamaica Rum, 69%**

**Nose:** An all-out assault on the nose in the best possible way. This isn't a pour that takes it's time slowly opening up, it crashes through the door ready to rock and roll. An enormous tropical blast of fresh pineapple and green apple, a huge mean edge of sulfury flint, vanilla(somehow), sharp cutting menthol, chalk, fresh grass clippings, thick syrupy sweet sugar. All kinds of enormous and zany notes, so much fucking fun

**Taste:** My god, somehow the dramatic nose still doesn't prepare you. It's a fucking beast, an explosion of flavor I've never experienced before. It's like a mix of menthol, sulfur, and sugar and it's fucking huge with a mean edge along with fruity pineapple, funky banana, sugary vanilla, green apple, grass. It's somehow a blunt force trauma and a razor knife of flavor at the same time. There's so much going on and it's so huge it feels like I'm just along for the ride.

**Finish:** Gritty, sulfury sugar builds to epic heights, this is a fucking juggernaut of delicious and crazy flavors. Tons of bright, lively tropical fruit sugar leaves an amazingly pleasant taste lingering foooooorever.

*****

My god I'm in love with this stuff! I've never tasted anything like it, the whole experience from start to finish is just invigorating and puts a smile on my face. Words don't do it justice, it has to be experienced. It doesn't even seem fair judging it by the same criteria as other spirits, it's so different that it's almost in it's own category(I honestly have no idea if there's any rums out there similar to this stuff).

I haven't given many 10/10 ratings before, it's not a score I should have to ""decide"" on after careful consideration. A 10/10 should be completely apparent, no doubt in my mind. And based on the sheer enjoyment level of this stuff, I have no choice in this matter.

I like to add a couple drops to a mai tai. It is life changing
It's a killer. Delicious but brutal. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if drinking that would give you immunity to Covid
I bought a bottle sight unseen (untasted?) and as soon as I opened it my wife yelled ‚Äúwhat is that smell‚Äù from the other side of the house. It‚Äôs as intense a drink as I‚Äôve ever experienced. Your review is spot on.
Hell yeah welcome to the rum life. It truly is a world of explosive amazing flavors.
[deleted]
Sadly, I can‚Äôt take credit for this particular release - I was only on the panel that selected XXX/4 through 6. But I do love it for the fact that it makes absolutely ridiculous cocktails. üòä
If you liked the DOK, you should definitely try Savanna HERR. Similar bomb, different taste.
This booze is not to be consumed by weaklings. 

Matter of fact it's not really drinkable, more sipable. Right Mama?  

HEY MAN, cue up this Doors-Live video; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yJvGFDLot0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yJvGFDLot0)  timing your first taste to the 9:42 mark of the music and your first reaction to that taste to the 9:56 mark of the music. CAN YOU DIG IT!
I know right? I got the gold and silver almost immediately after posting, not sure who or why but I'll take it!

EDIT: It's also much appreciated, thank you kind stranger
u/Scotch_Fanatic is the owner of FineDrams :)
Beautiful. You‚Äôve brought tears to my eyes.
As much as I love Whiskey and other spirits(including rum now apparently), I've never been big on mixed drinks. So I've never had a mai tai but I'll bet this stuff will kick any cocktail into high gear!
Works wonders adding a few drops to a daiquiri too. Really elevates one made with an inexpensive white rum.
Thanks for reading, and yeah I believe it lol. I compared the experience to my first sip of peated scotch in another comment, and it's similar in this regard as well: the whole room will know what you're drinking
I still dont think I'm into it quite enough to dive in more, I think I'm happy with my 3 aficianado picks now (DOK, xxx4 and xxx5). I have a k&l clement rhum CS single barrel that I really loved as well, its unopened for now. Those all cover some pretty widely varying flavors, so I think I'm set for now. Delicious stuff though for sure
please tell us OP!
Add Mhoba HE. The trinity of palate destruction
A few dozen bottles of the HERR just went up on K&L, by the way. Just saying. üôÇ
Omg thank you so much, I love watching full concerts on youtube and this looks like a fucking banger. I saw tom petty's last show at the bowl, amazing place. The doors there in 68, fucking wow
I'm familiar with him, and yeah I forgot to include him so thanks! He's given me some great input and Scotch recommendations in the past.
Seriously, I can't oversell what an experience this bottle was. To me it's very similar to my very first sip of Laphroaig in my early Scotch days, which was my first peated dram. Like the Laphroaig, it just kind of blew my mind because I didn't know anything could taste like this, and it was love at first sip. I mean I really loved the XXX/Four(gave it a 9), but it basically still tasted like a really good rum. This DOK is a whole different experience.
Mai tais change drastically with the blend of rums you use, so I like to try new rums in them all the time
Consider adding a clairin if you like mental flavours.
I looked it up, and a mai tai uses two different kinds of rum, a clear and a dark? That's interesting, I could totally see that having all kinds of interesting variations. 

I usually get sick of mixed drinks long before I finish the glass, just too sweet. And they require keeping so many extra ingredients around and so much work, I'm a lazy man. If I want something cold or other than neat spirits, I'll drink a beer.
Most tiki is a light/dark combination. I generally don't add simple syrup to mai tais, margaritas, or daiquiris, because I don't like sweet things. I brew, so beer is my go to. Tiki and rum are fun experiments
Could try a Hemingway Daiquiri and reduce the sugar.  https://punchdrink.com/articles/ultimate-best-hemingway-daiquiri-cocktail-recipe/"
Reviews #137/138: Old Pulteney 21 & 25,,https://i.redd.it/mr1bscis4ao41.jpg,"Samples courtesy of u/crc128

*****

**Old Pulteney 21, 46%**

**Nose:** Thick cereal malt, hay, rich salted caramel, thick and waxy, white chocolate, light earthy and musty wood with slight char, some dark raisin fruits and malt. Elegant and smoothly rich

**Taste:** Smooth rich caramel with light brine, velvety malt, sweet barley and cereal notes, smooth dark fruits. Creamy and malty with just a slight hint of smooth fruit, that same kind of effortless and smooth richness as the nose.

**Finish:** Sweet toasted wood notes, vanilla, rich caramel malt and easy dark fruits.

*****

**Old Pulteney 25, 46%**

**Nose:** Subtle tropical fruits, smooth sweet vanilla, caramel, nice funky brine, nutty, barley sugar, refined cereal malt, mild wood funk. Nothing jumps out too boldly, it's all very delicate and balanced

**Taste:** Smooth and elegant maltiness, vanilla, bright clean fruits, sweet cereal and sugar grain, clean delicate caramel. Has an effortlessly rich and flavorful mouthfeel, the flavors just meld and flow with lots of malty barley sweetness

**Finish:** Flavor flows into the finish with easygoing peppery zing, sweet barley, malt and caramel

*****

These are both delicious, I'm not sure there is even a clear winner. They didn't go heavy on the sherry with these like other distilleries seem to do with older Scotches, they are both very malt forward which I love. Old Pulteney always has delicious Malt and Bourbon barrel flavor, the (old)12yr is one of my go-to cheap malt bombs. 

The 25 is a classically ""smooth and refined"" old Scotch. It's light and delicate, more sweet floral Barley and bright fruit. But I think I might slightly prefer the 21. It's more robust and rich, it has a thicker and fuller mouthfeel with some dark fruits that add more body and depth. But it is still super malt-forward overall. A couple of great Scotches for sure.

Velvety smooth sweet sherry with smooth wood notes and tons of rich caramel malt, incredibly balanced and well-crafted for being a single barrel. A nice rich yet soft mouthfeel that is super drinkable at the respectable ABV.

This is one of my favs. Certainly higher on my list.
I wanna try one of these so bad. Just can't go for a full bottle since they're so pricey.
Another excellent review. It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve had this one but your  review has convinced me that I need to go out and get some. Binny‚Äôs has it for $120. How much is a bottle of this near you? I agree with you that pricing has really gone up.
Yeah it's impressive stuff for sure
Yeah I could have swore last time I looked a few years ago these were at or under $100, they have really skyrocketed. Scotch prices are kind of stupid all over anymore. It's not so bad that I cant buy bottles I like, but it's bad enough that it's hard to experiment on stuff like this sometimes :(
A quick search shows $120-$140 at Socal stores, one place has it for $109 and the more gouge-y stores have it for $150. I guess the lower end of that isn't too crazy. 

Honestly I've been on a mission to get some Tomatin 18 ever since [I tried it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/f8fxbk/review_129_tomatin_18/), I would go with that over this stuff considering the price. It's a really nice complex and elegant sherried Scotch, 46%, NCF/NCA and under $100. It was as good or better than this imo. Balvenie makes quality stuff though, you can't go wrong either way.
Thanks for the info. I had that Balvenie when it first came out. I remember it as being pretty good but then I went on my in depth scotch journey to all the other distilleries and several years later, have pretty much not gone back to Balvenie, yet. I haven't had any Tomatin yet and the Tomatin 18 is available near me for $110, so I will put that one on my "" to buy"" list and pick it up first. I will circle back to the Balvenie and try that 15 year old, sherry cask at another time. PM me over at WN.
Pm'd you over there"

**Port Charlotte PC7 ""Sin An Doigh Ileach,"" 61%**

**Nose:** Sweet char and ash, intense peat, sweet vanilla, tropical pineapple fruits, tar, brine, charred barrel. Intensely peaty and charred Islay nose, but it nails that unique PC clean and fruity character. Delicious already

**Taste:** Clean and mean Islay. Clean caramel and tons of sweet char, heavy smoke and peat, brine, lemon citrus, cinnamon spice, bright vanilla. It's super peaty with tons of sweet barrel notes. I think it's about as sweet of a Bourbon barrel Scotch as I've ever had.

**Finish:** Huge ashy and peaty finish, vanilla, tons of sweet peaty char that lingers a long time like only Islay peat can.

*****

Jesus, this stuff has quite the presence. Bright sweet char and tons of proper Islay peat. It reminds me of a brighter and happier version of Laphroaig 10CS, it has similar thick peat, vanilla and charred Bourbon barrel notes but it's like 10x sweeter and more upbeat. Very in-character for a Port Charlotte with a clean and fruity quality, interesting and unique flavors that sneak in along with all the quintessential Islay flavor.

These always have kind of a ""basic"" feel to me, it's hard to describe. There's good flavor but it all comes at you in a flash and lacks depth and complexity. Still a tasty Bourbon, and I love the Wheat sweetness, but there's just something that always holds these back from greatness to me. Maybe it's just personal preference. This is one of the better ones I've had, it's not so brash and it's heavier on the creamy sweetness that I love. Lots of air helps make it richer and smooths it out, it's enough to bump it up a point. A super sweet and enjoyable pour that appeals to my WHEATER lust.

> These always have kind of a ""basic"" feel to me, it's hard to describe. There's good flavor but it all comes at you in a flash and lacks depth and complexity.

I'd love to try one of these made with older bourbon, i.e. that's been matured for longer; the MM PS that I've tried seem a bit young and that I think is holding them back a bit. But on the other hand I've never had a really old Maker's Mark of any kind, so I don't know if it ages the way that other wheated bourbons seem to do.

Strongly agree and I also have trouble articulating it. It's like these should be better but they aren't for some reason
Yeah that's what I was wondering if the age is the issue. I have no idea how old these tend to be, so I wanted to refrain from commenting on it. If it is just too young, I feel like it's actually decent for being a young age
You and me both. I have no idea what older Maker's would taste like but I would like to know
I wouldn't take it as gospel, but the spirits dept manager at one store (not a big chain) where I bought their store pick MM PS told me that theirs was aged about 4 years plus the extra stave finishing period. I don't know how representative that is.

All in all I'd say it is a very good bourbon for that age range, and a nice change of pace from the hype & insanity that is SOP for wheated bourbons these days. But I'd love to try one that came from a barrel in the 8-12 yo range.

**Nose:** Toffee, honey, dry fruity sherry, warm chocolatey orange, twangy malt, wet earthy wood, chocolate. It's a dry and mellow sherry nose, fruity and sweet but not in your face about it. Plenty of rich malt and barrel notes

**Taste:** Bold sweet fruits, sticky toffee, warm and grapey, plum, chocolate strawberries, hot spice, vanilla, rich and meaty caramel malt, cherry dessert notes, sweet oak char. Lots of yummy rich malt and wood notes along with the fruity sweetness of the sherry, complex yet balanced and thick.

**Finish:** Big finish of bright sweet cherry and spice, dark caramel, vanilla char and sweet fruits. Deliciously sweet and dark finish.

*****

A delicious bottle of sherried Scotch. It's pleasantly sweet and fruity but there's lots of darker toffee and wood notes as well, and it's so rich and malty. It's a big wave of complex flavors that come together beautifully. I'm a big fan of Dailuaine but I think this might be my first sherried bottle. I love that it has such a rich and meaty malt character that shines through. It was a little too dark and closed at first I think, but there seems to be more of  the fruity sweetness opening up that I look for in sherried Scotch and I'm loving it. If you're looking for an all-out decadent sherry bomb this isn't really it, it's got a little more going on than that and IMO it's a little more interesting because of it.

Awesome! I have a bottle of Signatory CS Dailuaine on the way and am so pumped.
Ooh, I was waiting for someone to review this one! Looks like I should order me a bottle. üòä

Your notes make it sound very much like a sherried Mortlach. Would you say that‚Äôs a decentish point of comparison?
Nice review. It  sounds really good.
Nice, what are the stats and where are you getting it from?
I've never had a sherried mortlach actually, Shame on me I know. But from what I've seen about mortlach, yeah that's pry a fair comparison. It has a meaty quality, it's much more malty and woody than your average winey fruit bomb. Hit me up on WN if you like.
20 year old, 1998. 53.6% and hogshead matured. Fine Drams.  I love a meaty spirit like Mortlach and have read great things about Dailuaine. I rolled the dice on this one after reading the description which sounds right up my alley. I'll be sure to post a review in good time!
Thanks! I‚Äôm on a hiatus from WN at the moment due to my collection being in storage, but that should resolve in a couple of weeks. I‚Äôll hit you up then. üôÇ
I came really close to grabbing that one as well, its definitely still on my wishlist. Looking forward to your review!"
Review #133: Dalmore 13 Exclusive Malts 53.5%,,https://i.redd.it/962il91b1pm41.jpg,"**Dalmore 13 2000, Exclusive Malts, 53.5%**

**Nose:** Surprisingly smoky but in an easy and unobtrusive Highland style. Woody smoke, slightly phenolic, dark honey, caramel, malt, floral and waxy, wood char, chocolate oak. Very nice balance of darker smoke and wood notes with rich and floral maltiness.

**Taste:** Rich smooth malt, waxy honey, caramel, smooth sweet wood and floral notes, there's some mellow smoke funk but it's more of a mouthfeel than a strong presence of it's own if that makes sense. It tastes rich and well rounded, doesn't explode on the palate but has a nice thick feel

**Finish:** Builds big and pleasant with sweet charred vanilla, rich fruity malt and menthol that zings the palate, it all lingers for a long time

*****

This bottle needed some time to come around, but it's become an excellent straightforward malty Scotch. The smoke is a light and interesting element, but mostly just a presence on the nose. It was a real shocker at first since it's not what I normally associate with Dalmore. When I first opened the bottle it nosed like a peat monster, but the smoke has settled now and the rich malty wood has come through beautifully. Not the most complex or huge Whisky, but a good malty Scotch like this can beautiful in it's simplicity when done right. I haven't been impressed with the Dalmore OB's I've tried (although the Port Wood Reserve was delicious), so it's a lot of fun to try this proper cask strength bottling.

Excellent review, sound really good. It's funny how some whisky's just need to breath a bit and then get oh so good.  Do you have a good selection of Exclusive Malts out by you? Binny's here had some but they're not so plentiful any more.
Beautiful review. The type of review that comes off as simply sharing your good fortune. 
I'm a Sommelier of wine since 1996. I'm only about 14 months with Whiskies but as true with wine it goes with Whiskies. Let it Breathe

! It always benefits from time. This is a perfect example.
My first bottle of Craigellachie 13 the neck pour was smokey for the first 10 to 15 mins but then gave way to the really nice rich unique dram I had been lead to expect.
Good pours need to breathe. 
Well illustrated!
Nuff said.
Richard Paterson says you need to thrroowww it away. Clearly it doesn‚Äôt have enough e150 in it.
Not OP but it is a bit sad to see the dwindling presence of Exclusive Malts on the shelves since the company was sold and all we have left is what was left from previous batches.  At this point, most of the EM bottlings I see still sitting around are these older releases styled like the one in OP's review, many of which are teenaged ex-bourbon single casks and often priced a bit too high for me to want to roll the dice on.
So I've told you about this store before. I only get to go when I'm visiting family, but they have a ton of old interesting IB's like this. You'll notice this was bottled in 2013, well everything they have is bottled between 2000 and 2015. This is the same place where I've gotten all my raw cask bottlings. It's a total out if the way hole in the wall and their stock doesn't seem to move much, so there's bottles I've been looking at for years now that I'll pick up eventually. The whisky guy who works there is this really cool old timer that I sit and chat with whenever I'm there, he's super knowledgable and pours a bunch of samples. It's a great spot and I keep it super secret haha
Thanks for reading! Yeah you really need to let a pour breath. An interesting thing with Whisky though is that a bottle can really transform over a long period of time as well. This bottle has been opened for 3 or 4 months now, and I'm enjoying it much more than when it was freshly opened.

Also that Craigellachie 13 is a delicious bottle. That's another really solid malty scotch
Agreed. Not a lot of reviews on some of these so, same here, not going to take a chance on them at the prices many are at.
Ah, got it. That's the one you mentioned before. Sounds like one could spend a lot of money is a shop like that, and that's not a bad thing. Sounds fun.
>Sounds like one could spend a lot of money is a shop like that

One could, and I have lol. When I first found the store about 4 or 5 years ago, the stuff was pretty overpriced but I just thought of it as a ""tax"" I paid for the huge selection of interesting and unique bottles. But what's funny is that with the Scotch market slowly creeping up, the prices seem saner every year. It's this interesting situation where the bottles seem cheaper even though they've had the same price tag on them for 10+ years.

For reference, this bottle was $120 which was a bit much for a youngish IB 5-10 years ago, but a little more in line with today's prices.
That's really pretty amazing that they have held their pricing. Yea, prices have really gone up. More of a challenge to find good bottles at good prices I guess. Speaking of that, Binny's has  a big sale going on. They call it ""end of bin"" sale on certain bottles. I picked up a bottle of that SCN Clynelish 9 year old for $70. No idea why this one was on sale. I also picked up a Signatory CS Mortlach bottling, 11 year old, first fill bourbon cask, 55.1% for $62. I tried some last night. It's incredibly sweet. It's almost like it was aged in a sauternes cask. It's like a Mortlach liqueur. It's not bad at all but I'm hoping with a little water and time it will settle down to normal. I think I'm all set to be self quarantined for at least 14 days.
Killer deals dude! I still haven't opened my Clynelish 9 but I'm looking forward to it. Funny thing I just ordered a Signatory 12yr Mortlach Bourbon barrel as well, but it's just a standard 46% UCF bottle. Yours sounds interesting.

Yeah I don't know how this store has remained such a gem. It's more of a wine place I think, and it's in a really affluent area. The only people I ever see in the Whisky aisle there don't seem too knowledgeable and are bragging about all the expensive Macallan they've had as they pass up these cool bottles.
That's funny. That Mortlach sounds good too. So, I was thinking last night, I remember a sherried Mortlach I had a handful of years ago. It was the Flora and Fauna Mortlach 16. A gem. So I added some Glendro 18, just a bit, to a dram of this 11 year old bourbon aged Mortlach - a combination that really works.

Well, I hope your little shop doesn't get discovered and their clientele, just keep dreaming of that Macallan and pay no attention to all the little gems around them. Sounds like a great place."

*****

**Ben Nevis 10 Limited Edition Batch 1 62.4%**

**Nose:** Epicly huge and luscious nose on this stuff. I'm really picking up all the complexities of the different barrels. Earthy fruits and figs, bold sherry, green apple, big toasted wood, rich toffee, tart berry, rich caramel malt, sweet vanilla, oak char, meaty sulfur, lots of complex fruity wine notes. Incredibly thick and complex nose

**Taste:** Explodes with thick meaty flavor on the palate, doesn't let you down one bit from the incredible nose. Sweet earthy fruits that pop, thickly rich toffee, gritty toasted wood, insanely meaty caramel malt, sweet nuts and fruit, vanilla, wood char. Tons of delicious wine flavor keeps building but never takes over, it makes way for lots of other complex Scotchy flavors. It's a beast of a Scotch and it uses every last drop to deliver tons of flavor.

**Finish:**Sweet earthy fruits and vanilla build bigger and bigger, then slowly settle into this darkly rich ooze of dark fruits, sticky dark toffee, vanilla, wood and oak char. Just wow.

*****

I've never had a Scotch quite like this, it's a fucking beast but it's so complex and nuanced at the same time. They've done an excellent job of combining all the different barrel influences into a cohesive monster of a malt, yet letting each one keep it's own voice. At 62% it uses every last bit of it's insane proof to deliver insane flavor. And as a proof whore with a never-ending lust for bigger and bolder flavor, this stuff fucking satisfies. Big thanks to u/hmm4 for putting this bottle on my radar.

You are welcome and glad you like it. Now that‚Äôs a review! I‚Äôll have to see if I can find a bottle. I‚Äôm just a huge Ben Nevis fan. Have you had their standard 10 year old?
Love this bottling. I was also saddened to see it sell out at FD. I totally would have bought a second. Great note.
Personally I'm a much bigger fan of the standard 10 year old myself. I found this to have too much cask influence over the end result but to each their own!
Damnit, now you're going to make me regret passing on this when I had the chance.
I like your poster in the back. I saw one a long time ago but the monkey was smoking a doobie instead
Very much agree with your review.  This stuff is really good, very pleased I got a bottle (and a second).
No, I've never even had an OB from them before this one. I've had a few IB's that I enjoyed to varying degrees, but nothing as good as this. 

You just always seem to get such interesting and delicious looking bottles, I wanted to get out of my own comfort zone and ask what you would buy. And this is one you expressed interest in. Doubt I would have looked at it otherwise.
I also had this in my cart for a while and decided to pass. I thought it was a bit steep for an OB 10 year old.  I went with the Signatory 27 instead which is outrageous. Now I wish I had this 10 because Ben Nevis at cask strength seems to be awesome no matter the age. Let's not regret the past, and be ready to strike in the future.
Yeah same here. I didn't want to say anything, I feel bad lamenting that I cant buy a backup bottle when people here didn't even get the one lol.
>I found this to have too much cask influence over the end result

I can totally see that. This feels like a showcase for zany barrel shenanigans, but it's just so expertly done. I still love a good straightforward malty Scotch though.
Yeah, have to agree with part of that, it‚Äôs definitely a cask driven dram, but it‚Äôs a full carnival of one! The regular 10 was nice too, but I was smitten by all the bells and whistles of the CS, personally.
Sorry, not my intention! It's gone now on FineDrams where I bought it from, I didn't even realize. I thought I was just giving a recommendation.
So you're the one who got my second bottle!
I was obsessing over this one and then like u/wreninrome, it was too late. Oh well. It looks and sounds amazing.
There will always be another delicious dram to come :-)
I definitely don't disagree! It's really personal preference at this point, not something I would reach for often but if I wanna taste DAT cask, you bet this would be very near the top of the list.
It's all good!  I was surprised actually at how long it took for this to sell out on TWE.  But if I remember right, I think it got some not-so-enthusiastic initial reviews on Whiskybase so that may have quelled the demand for it a bit.

Great review, and I'm glad you're liking it.  Given the way that Nikka handles Ben Nevis, combined with the [rumor](http://www.whiskyfun.com/archivedecember19-2-Laphroaig-Glenfarclas.html) that Colin Ross has left the distillery, is not a good omen for those of us who wanted to see more of these types of bottlings from them in the future.
I just got lucky with the timing I guess, I grabbed it when I was ordering the r/Scotch bottles.
The distillery are still selling it.
No doubt!
Hope there aren‚Äôt changes at BN. So I have an older bottling of the 10 and am getting one of the new 10 - looking forward to doing a side by side.
That‚Äôs cool. Just a reminder that there‚Äôs good stuff out there to be had and at a reasonable price üëç"
"Reviews 140/141: Four Roses Private Selection OBSF's, 11 year vs 8 year",,https://i.redd.it/wzf4cw8w8ql41.jpg,"FRPS's are some of my favorite Bourbon out there, and there's been a lot of to-do over the declining age of these. I happened to have two different OBSF samples of differing ages, so I thought a side-by-side would be fun. They are actually closer to 9 and 12 years old, but I guess I just wanted to keep the post title simple. (1) is courtesy of u/EtherRag and (2) is courtesy of u/Stefan__1985

*****

**(1) Four Roses Private Selection, Lakewood Medallion, OBSF 11yr 11mo 54.4%**

**Nose:** Basic kind of clean toasted wood, mild mustiness, light chocolatey oak, sweet metallic cherry, light evergreen. Mildly woody and mellow

**Taste:** Smooth wood and caramel, chocolate, mellow rye spice, clean caramel, smooth mint and wood. It's light and smooth, I feel like a Bourbon noob would love this. It might be just a tad too washed out though.

**Finish:** Richer finish of caramel and mellow hot cherry spice, brief barrel char, good but kind of simple and short.

*****

**(2) Four Roses Private Selection, Blackwell's, OBSF 8yr 11mo 60%**

**Nose:** Actually, nose is remarkably similar to (1). Mellow spicy wood, mild mustiness, metallic caramel, slightly more exciting floral notes and oak char

**Taste:** Really smooth for the proof, but still has some nice punchy flavor. Bright fruity cherry, very mild mint, metallic caramel, dark toasted wood, cool peppery spice

**Finish:** Mellow mintiness and oak char, peaks with some vibrant oak spice that lingers a long time. Delicious finish.

*****

* Surprisingly, neither the age of 1 or the high proof 2 stood out a lot, I would not have been able to tell these apart blind. Against conventional Bourbon wisdom, I prefer the younger 8yr to the 11yr. As I've often found with these Private Selects, the older expression is tasty but just kind of boring. and the younger bottle here isn't even a particularly amazing one, but it just has brighter and more dynamic flavors.

 Nice review my friend. You like it a bit more than i do, for me it‚Äòs a bit harsh :)
My personal assessment after trying a ton of FRPS is that I don‚Äôt prefer the 11+ year bottles.  9-10 is where it‚Äôs at in my opinion.  Cheers!
For me even a bad FRPS is still pretty good, 6 is usually as low as I go for these. I've maybe had one or two 5s before.
I agree. The younger bottles just seem to have a better track record for me. The exception is the LE bottlings, they can have some 13-14+ year stuff and they're amazing.
I agree, i love the standard SiB too. Very solid offering at a steal for the price"

**Taste:** Pretty tame and smooth, the low proof shows for sure. Caramel and nice mellow herbal Rye zing, sweet toasted oak, vanilla, brown sugar dessert sweetness, some gritty barrel notes on the tail end.

It's very woody but it's a smooth and well balanced oakiness with lots of sweet barrel notes, it's delicious and really interesting.

WP always delivers at the end. Great review!
Nice review. I don't typically see these at this low of a proof. Sounds good!
Which ABC is doing store picks?! I know a few that tend to have unusual stuff but I've yet to see a store pick.
Wait, was this released recently? Or is this a old release? Still there? Or all gone?

Great review as always though
Agreed, I love these so much. Still some of my favorite Whiskey out there for sure.
Right? I mention in my review that it's probably the lowest proof WP SiB I've ever had, it's neat having one that's so smooth and drinkable even if I may prefer the hotter ones.
North Carolina. Sorry if that's not what you meant, I'm actually in California and I'm not sure how that stuff works

*****

**Ardmore 16 1998, Gordon & Macphail Binny's pick, refill sherry 55.5%**

**Nose:** Kind of muted. Very little smoke at first, I had to double check that it said ""Ardmore"" and not some obscure similarly-named distillery. One note sherry, sour funk, some mildly rich toffee, more medicinal smoke notes with some air. It takes a lot of air time for this to open up just a little

**Taste:** Dark earthy sherry, hot cherry spice, heat, barely any smoke, some caramel, earthy wood and chocolate. It's good and rich after some air time but kind of monotone.

**Finish:** Rich dark cherry and earthy sherry wood, lackluster finish.

*****

It's shocking how NOT smoky this is, does Ardmore make an unpeated Scotch? The sherry is pretty rich here so it might just be taking over, it's a very dark and earthy sherry. I don't hate it but there's not a whole lot to enjoy either, it's just kind of ""there"" with vaguely dark, rich flavor. It's flirting with some really excellent rich flavors but never really opens up. Maybe it was a first pour and the bottle needed more time? I feel compelled to add water, but I usually find that adding water in an attempt to save something doesn't work.

Ardmore does an unpeated run once a year, I believe it‚Äôs often called Adlair.
Nice review!  Have you had more strongly peated Ardmores before?  I've only had one Ardmore myself, the now-discontinued Traditional Cask, which I also found to be very mild when it came to peaty notes.
Nice review. This sounds really interesting. I almost picked a bottle of this up but passed - damn should have got it. Yes, they make a non-peated version called Ardlair. Here‚Äôs one available at Binny‚Äôs and yes, I have one and it is good https://www.binnys.com/signatory-ardlair-6-year-old-refill-sherry-butt-900027-winebow-select-960355.html
I think u/cigarinmyanus reviewed it a while ago.
I am really enjoying a 16 year Ardmore Cooper's Choice that is Bourbon Barrel finished.
I was just being a little dramatic, there is some slight smoke here it's just that its so light and overpowered by the sherry. But that is interesting to know
Thanks for reading. I've only had a couple of Ardmores, but what I've had has been pretty heavily peated. It's definitely a little more friendly than an Islay, but still a large presence. Maybe you're right though and some are just lighter.
How much did this 16yr go for? Because I would enjoy it ok if offered, but I wouldn't want to buy it. I think you did good not getting it.
That Ardlair was something else. I sent it out to several people blind. It threw people for a complete loop but most people liked it and thought it was much older than it's 6 year. I think they're are still a few bottles left.
I think it was around $65 or $70 or so. It was reasonable but passed.  Ok, good to hear.
Yes, agreed. It sure didn't drink at it's abv. Very nice stuff."

*****

**Smoke Wagon Private Single Barrel Bourbon(MGP), TotalWine #5386 10yr 56.7%**

**Nose:** Loving the nose, so far so good. Fruity cherry and lots of herbal spice, burnt orange, tobacco, root beer char, deep & friendly sweet toasted oak, musty wood. It's rich, oaky and herbal but very warm and inviting.

**Taste:** Tannic and woody but with lots of fun dynamic flavors to keep you on your toes. Hot spice, tobacco, tannic oak, burnt orange, some nice malty grain flavors and toffee, sweet oak char, minty mouthfeel, smooth root beer. It's super hot at first but after some air time it's really interesting and fun.

**Finish:** Hot cherry and orange with big, mouth-numbing herbal spice that lingers a long time

*****

Tons of tasty complex flavors that compliment the big oak and herbal spice beautifully, this is a really fun Bourbon. I'm not always huge on the herbal MGP Bourbon style so this walks a line for me, but there's no denying the delicious complex flavors here. I find it to be a lot of fun and pretty darn drinkable overall, after some significant air time.

Nice review!
Interesting.  I got my hands on a 12 year old single barrel and had the exact opposite experience.   I was shocked at how little heat there was. Drinkable immediately upon pouring. Really enjoyed it for that reason.  I have tried their uncut unfiltered and the desert jewel and liked this single barrel the most. I always enjoy seeing (reading) the variance between barrels.
The single barrel bottles from Total Wine are fantastic- I try to always keep a bottle on hand, and don‚Äôt drink it too often since it‚Äôs pricy (for bourbon).
Thanks! I had to go for it after we talked haha. I hope mine is this good"

*****

**Bruichladdich 1990 27yr, Signatory CS #166, refill sherry butt, 55.5%**

**Nose:** Clean rich caramel and sugary malt, toffee, subdued warm sherry fruits, light green apple, barley sugar, vanilla, milk chocolate. It's kind of delicate and subdued, but delicious

**Taste:** Bright sweet malt, glistening caramel, sweet barley, subdued and mild fruitiness, mild funk, delicate vanilla

**Finish:** Sweet malt and light sugary pastry, a hint of earthier wood. It's a tasty finish but a little short

*****

A delicious Scotch, with minimal sherry influence from the refill Butt. That's fine with me since I prefer a lighter sherry influence, but keep in mind I really mean *minimal* here. It actually drinks more like a malty Scotch with maybe just a mild fruity warmth. It has the amazing balance and beautifully melded flavors of a well-aged Scotch, but it's maybe a tad too light and delicate for me. If you want something well-aged that is flavorful yet smooth though it's delicious.

Score: **7**

Sounds really very good. Nice review.
Excellent review. I think I first reviewed this particular bottle when I first opened it. I should probably re-visit this as I'm sure some air time has changed it a bit.
Bruichladdich was one of my first Scotch loves, still one of my favorite distilleries. I've been neglecting their unpeated stuff for some time though in favor of Octo and PC, it's nice to drink a good malty Laddie.
It looks like we basically agree but got some drastically different notes. It is a super dry sherry like you said, and I did get a bit of funk like you did. And I can totally see the citrus notes, they never seem to jump out at me until I'm looking for it. I seemed to pick up a lot more malt notes though.

If you do go back to it I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts after the air time
Was it now? It‚Äôs an amazing distillery. The Laddich 12 and 16 was so good. I really enjoy their unpeated stuff though.  The best I had was the Black Arts 3.1. Long gone but both their peated and unpeated is Craizily good. Have you had the Cadenheads Bruichladdich 25 year old bourbon cask aged,  54.0%? If not, pm me.
The laddie was a 10yr, and yeah that original 46% was one of my first really good single malts. I have a couple backup bottles from when they discontinued it. Agree the 3.1 was amazing, I think that's the only Black Arts I've had. 

Is that Cadenhead the 175th anniversary bottle? Geez I remember really wanting to check it out, but I debated too long and it was gone.
Yes, it's the Cadenheads 175 anniversary bottle. Have you tried it? I didn't know you were a big Bruichladdich fan.
No I don't think I have tried it, maybe we should talk over on WN

Yeah I'm a big Laddie fan. I still get a craving for their NAS Laddie sometimes. I have 2 bottles of the original 46% 10yr and 1 bottle of the 2nd edition 50% stashed. It just seems like they don't do much with their unpeated malts these days, so I mostly stick to Port Charlotte and Octo anymore but I love Laddie."

This is my first time ever trying Calvados, which is Apple Brandy. I only just heard of it actually, and threw these samples in with a recent Scotch order.

*****

**Chateau du Breuil Calvados 8yr, 40%**

**Nose:** Unmistakable tart apple fruitiness, wow this is fun already! Wet musty wood, light sugary sweetness, butter. Light, tart and sweet

**Taste:** I want to put ""apple brandy"" as a tasting note, because this is exactly what I would have thought apple brandy would taste like. Mild zing of tart, almost bitter apple. Light buttery cream, mild sugary sweetness, some slight ethanol and new make flavor that is a bit unpleasant. Gets smoother and creamier with some air.

**Finish:** Sweet cream and tart bitter apple, but that new make flavor lingers a bit like a cheap Irish or Canadian Whiskey. Like the taste it evens out with some air time.

* I can't say it's completely enjoyable with the buttered popcorn new-make spirit flavor in there, but there's definitely some fun and interesting flavor here so I'm hoping it's maybe just too young and the older versions will be better. An interesting little pour but I would not buy it.

Score: **4/10**

*****

**Chateau du Breuil Calvados 12yr, 41%**

**Nose:** Bright tart apple fruitiness that is much bolder and fruitier than the 8yr. Honey, tart apple, creamy butterscotch, buttery wood, some mild spice, fun fruits. Just a delicious nose.

**Taste:** Tart apple, bright and clean. musty wood, rich honey, pastry sugar, floral, grass clippings, mildly astringent

**Finish:** Slightly darker on the finish with caramel, buttery wood, and tart apple fruit.

* A huge improvement over the 8yr. All the same fun flavors but it's bigger and bolder, more balanced and doesn't have the off-putting young spirit notes. The apple flavor here sings, it's bright and clean compared to the watered down 8yr but it still balances well with the creamy sweetness and mild wood. Just really fun and delicious stuff.

Score: **7/10**

*****

**Chateau du Breuil Calvados 15yr, 41%**

**Nose:** The tart apple fruitiness is strong and clear, but it's starting to warm and mellow really nicely with the rest of the rich, creamy nose. Warm tart apple and pear, creamy butterscotch,delicate vanilla toasted wood, white chocolate.

**Finish:** More zingy than the rich mellow nose. Crystal clear apple fruitiness that has a very vibrant pop to it, almost brash. Champagne tingle, mild toasted wood, vanilla, tart grape fruits, delicate wood funk, light vanilla and white chocolate

**Taste:** Almost like a tingly and bubbly apple champagne, with some mild wood funk and menthol

* This one is interesting. The nose seemed to confirm my assumption that the upward progression from 8yr -> 12yr would continue, it was richer and warmer and more balanced while keeping that delicious apple fruitiness. But then the flavor throws a bit of a wild card with some vibrant and complex flavors. The richer wood notes are nice but remain very delicate, the main attraction is definitely still the apple. Unfortunately though this one just doesn't quite come together for me, I miss the creamier sweetness of the 8yr and 12yr. I think the 12yr is the clear winner of the 3, it strikes the perfect balance of vibrant apple fruitiness and sweet creamy goodness.

I have some experience reviewing Whiskies but am a total noob with Rum.

*****

**XXX/Four: South Pacific 15 Year Old 2004 (Fiji), 66.8%**

**Nose:** Bright and fruity, maple syrup, musty wood, rich toffee candy. Beautiful balance of bright fruits and smooth rich barrel notes, so delicious and inviting.

**Taste:** Rich toffee and maple syrup, explodes with sweet spicy rum, orange citrus, bright tropical fruits. An explosion of flavor, everything is perfectly executed

**Finish:** Incredibly long and spicy finish with sticky-sweet toffee and sweet bright fruits, wow. the tingly delicious rum spice lingers for ages

* This feels so right, the balance it achieves with such huge flavor is unreal. The richer barrel notes feel like a candy version *of* barrel notes, the fruits and rum flavor pop, and it's all perfectly executed. Just wow

Score: **9/10**

*****

**XXX/Five: Saint Catherine Jamaica 2yr, 65%**

**Nose:** Holy cow, it's a funky rum! Buttered popcorn, banana, honey, pineapple, butterscotch creaminess.

**Taste:** Really interesting and complex flavors here. Creamy butterscotch and bright pineapple, menthol zing, sweet fruity rum, cool minty spice, vanilla. Huge flavor that slowly builds and takes over the palate, it's a juggernaut of creamy richness and funky tropical fruits.

**Finish:** Looong rich finish of cool, bright pineapple and menthol spice

* This is delicious, and so fucking interesting. Has some funky raw spirit flavors but it's harnessed and presented in a really cool way, and it is somehow so rich and creamy. I can't stress enough how interesting it is.

Score: **8/10**

*****

**XXX/Six: Mauritius 9yr 2010, 67.2%**

**Nose:** Lighter and more refined compared to 4 and 5. Vegetal, grassy, eucalyptus, menthol, clean rum spirit, buttery

**Taste:** Descends quickly into a sticky black hole. Heavy black liquorice, dark rum, fresh herbal spices. It's such a dark journey

**Finish:** Long black liquorice finish, it's mouth numbing and pretty cool

* This is the one I was most looking forward to, because it's a similar style to the only rum I ever really loved which was a Clement rhum agricole from Martinique. I don't know how typical that one was, but this is a whole different game lol. The black liquorice just takes over, it's tasty and very unique in my spirits experience but I don't like it as much as the others so far.

Score: **6/10**

Well fucking great, it looks like I'm a rum fan now. Maybe not enough to dive head first into the rum world, but I liked these enough to buy a few for sure. Definitely gonna order a bottle of 4 and 5 unless I procrastinate too long and it sells out. 6 is really good and super unique, but just not my thing. Thank you u/t8ke, u/xreekinghavocx, and the whole team for picking some stunning spirits here. Oh and my wallet says fuck you
Thanks so much for the reviews! I‚Äôm always interested to see what people think of these three.

I was on the tasting panel that selected these three casks. XXX/Six was my number one pick, Five was towards the middle of the pack and Four was - as I recall - somewhere in my bottom three or four. I‚Äôm quite the outlier, though. üòÇ
Are these still unavailable in the United States?
i hate that I can't get these in Canada...
One of us, one of us!
hoooooo baby! Glad you're loving on that Fiji like I am! Great reviews, and so glad to see another person joining our ""loves rum"" family :)
Man that Jamaica sounds like *my. fucking. jam.*
Grab a bottle of XXX3 too, it's incredible!
I have GOT to try the XXX/Six!
Thanks for reading, and thanks for being a part of all this even if our views differ a little haha. Although they are all different enough that it seems like it's gonna boil down to personal preference of styles more than a ""better/worse"" thing. 

I didn't review it, but I also tried the DOK Trelawny Jamaica and holy shit that stuff knocked my socks off. I actually really enjoyed it and want a bottle of that now as well. Talk about unique. I really enjoyed your write-up of that.
They are available on FineDrams, but yeah they ship from Europe
Well, somewhat although I still feel like a visitor. I will probably buy these couple of bottles and be happy. I've done similar with Mezcal, I really enjoy it but I've been happy for a few years now with just keeping a bottle or two around when I'm in the mood.
In my very limited experience that Fiji is the best rum I've ever had and only the 2nd time I've ever wanted to buy a bottle. The first time was a K&L Clement Rhum Agricole Single Barrel, but that one almost reminded me of a Scotch. These XXX's on the other hand are pure Rum perfection. 

It's cool you guys are doing these picks, so a filthy casual like me who is unfamiliar with the Rum world can still manage to find some excellent stuff. Same goes for the Armagnac.
jams all around!!
It‚Äôs definitely very off-profile for Worthy Park, in a good way. I typically rank WP in my top three favorite distilleries in the world. It‚Äôs so amazing how they can produce so many different marques with varying character.
Yeah I tried a sample of the XXX3 as well, I agree it was delicious but I didn't like it as much as the XXX4. So I may just stick with the 4,5 and DOK. As someone who isn't totally into rum, those 3 are probably plenty to keep me busy for a long while.
XXX/Six is good. I don't get as much licorice as OP, more bright agricole grass that fades into... graham crackers? while that Clairin/Paranubes briney, funky taste lurks in the background.
DOK is the best! A drop or 2 in an crappy cocktail turns it into a fantastic fruit bomb cocktail.
Oof.  Yeah.  Way too pricy that way:
I'm glad you're enjoying them so far! It's really cool we've been able to do what we have so far, and I""m so encourage to see how many ""i'm not a brandy guy, but I had to try this"" or ""i'm not a rum guy but I think you ve converted me"" stories we've seen :)
Try some Hampden, I got a tiny sample of it in my Rum Advent Calender and it was very earthy tasting and the taste lingered for a good 20 - 30 minutes afterwards. It's the most Scotch-like rum I've had, sadly it's not available in my state.
Check out their site, the shipping probably isn't as bad as you think
Had a conversation in another sub kind of related to this. I think there are just so many people who don't really have any idea what rum is/can be. Saw a lot of people in the thread I was in like 'of course all rum is super sweet its made with sugar'. Most people have only ever been exposed to like Captain plus maybe Kraken and they just figure that's what rum is.
A very astute point. I know, personally speaking, I've been carting these releases around town to show anyone who tells me ""I hate rum, but I think i'd be open to trying something you say is good or different from the rums I've had"" and it's always amazing to see the reactions. I've seen a lot of ""holy shit, I didn't know rum could be like this.....this is GOOD"" which makes me so happy.

I just want people to drink good spirits they like, and a lot of people seem to be realizing that all rum isn't created equal. It gives a personal touch to a project I care so much a bout.
Rum is a lot like Scotch, there are so many different kinds of tastes and flavors that they can be all over the place.
You're like a missionary. A rum missionary. Hell yes.
I can't think of a better kind of missionary to be. Except brandy missionary. That's been fun. Maybe agave missionary next :)

"Review #137: Smoke Wagon ""Uncut Unfiltered"" Straight Bourbon",,https://i.redd.it/5wv2v3fmezi41.jpg,"Skin that smoke wagon and see what happens.
This stuff is sourced from MGP is apparently a blend of 4, 6, and 10 year barrels that were bottled at cask strength. I'm a huge fan of MGP Rye but quite honestly the Bourbon never did a whole lot for me, but it's been a while since I've tried any and I have high hopes for this one. So let's see! Courtesy of u/BlueWire94117

***** 

**Smoke Wagon ""Uncut Unfiltered"" Bourbon, 116.6/58.3%**

**Nose:** Big spicy wood that is dark and smooth, tobacco, herbal and minty, tart apple sweetness, vanilla, tannic wood. A pleasant and balanced nose but kind of simple or one dimensional.

**Taste:** A nice big Bourbony kick of dark flavor. Herbal kick, dark toasted wood, smooth mellow mint, earthy and mildly tannic, dark cherry sweetness, vanilla and sweet char, lots of mellow wood spice

**Finish:** Some nice dark sweetness of vanilla and dark cherry cola, builds to big toasted wood with lots of woody herbal spice.

*****

This stuff has character for sure. For how dark and tannic it is it's not bitter or unpleasant at all, it drinks really easy at 58% and has a nice balanced smoothness to it. There's tons of herbal and woody spice but it stays mellow and well balanced overall. It's still a little too tannic and herbal for my taste, I've just never been big on MGP Bourbon and this one doesn't seem to be an exception. It might sound weird but I almost enjoy it more if I just think of it as a Rye, there's just so much herbal and minty spice and I *am* a big Rye fan. I will say that it's growing on me the more I drink it, but not enough to buy a bottle.

I'm a big fan of the U&U. Gets better and better as the bottle goes down.
I've only had the desert jewel, got it based on reviews here and I thought it was great. Definitely a different profile than what else I've had from mgp.
I just tried my bottle of this yesterday and it drank super smooth and sweet with hints of butterscotch and orange peel. I got very little oak tannin or bitterness. Loved this one. Smoke Wagon seems to be killing it!
I still haven't tried the uncut unfiltered but I've enjoyed all the higher end stuff from them
I feel like our bourbon palates are pretty in line, as I feel similarly about MGP bourbon and rye's.
Desert Jewel may be my favorite of the SW's I have tried. Including my K&L 12 year SiB pick.
I have a single barrel sample to drink as well, I'm hoping I like that one more. I have enjoyed some SAOS single barrels in the past so I still have high hopes.
Not to mention seafood and Peanut Butter as well
I think some of the Smoke Wagon single barrels are better than a good number of SAOS single barrels.

For the uncut unfiltered 4 years is pretty young even as part of a blend
I love Smoke Wagon and have the three K&L single barrels. They are not quite as good as the Beastmasters (I had the most recent pick, which is one of my all time favorite bourbons), but I liked the two lower proof ones almost the same between the K&L picks. The higher proof was a bit hot and drank above its proof.

I also tried the SW SiBs along with some SAOS single barrels. I found the SAOS to be a bit sweeter on the finish and less herbal/spice. The SW SiBs will have a more refined profile than uncut unfiltered, but I think you'll get the same notes that you described in your review. The SiBs have a much thicker oily mouthfeel with smoother creamy finish than the UC/UF, but similar flavor profile.

I think you'll be happy with 5633, it was my favorite of the bunch. Based on the description I thought it would be my least favorite, and that I'd like the high proof one best. After trying them I reversed what I predicted.
That's really saying something. Even though the SAOS Bourbon single barrels I had were hit or miss, I know a lot of people were bonkers for them. Hope you're right, because I took a chance on a 12yr single barrel from K&L that I haven't opened yet. I just couldn't resist between Prepreludesh's reviews and K&L's glowing write up(I keep telling myself I won't fall for those!)
Thanks for the assessment, glad to hear you liked 5633 so much.
I haven't had any of the K&L bottles but the Beastmasters ones have been awesome
I got two of the K&L‚Äôs #5608 and #5597. I had high hopes, but both kind of fell flat for me. Having tried other Smoke Wagon products I should have known..
I got the 5633, so here's hoping that's the winner. It seemed like the profile of that one was more up my alley based on their descriptions. Sorry you don't like yours so much, hopefully time and air help them come around for you.
I did like that one better between the two, and they weren‚Äôt bad - just at the price point I can think of other things I would choose. I loved the older MGP bourbons from SAOS, but for the age on these it just wasn‚Äôt the same for me. Or maybe my memory of them was just better. Oh well."
Review #129: Tomatin 18,,https://i.redd.it/xnrl7y43oqi41.jpg,"Courtesy of u/unbreakablesausage

*****

**Tomatin 18, 46%**

**Nose:** Rich and even-keeled, it's warm and inviting. Warm fruity sherry, meaty sulfur, vanilla, rich pastry malt, smooth rich caramel, nice mellow tingle of pear and tart fruitiness, graham crackers, cake frosting. It's complex yet smooth and rich, I'll say it again the nose is so delicious and inviting.

**Taste:** Right away this feels like a properly aged malt, all the rich flavors just meld and flow beautifully. Dry fruity sherry, big smooth toffee, rich waxy malt, light milk chocolate, toasted brown sugar wood, sweet barley sugar, lightly tart fruits. Complex yet balanced and smooth in way that always makes me feel like something is well aged and well blended.

**Finish:** Perks up just a hair with some tart fruits and brown sugar, then oozes smoothly into sweet and malty toffee goodness

*****

Straightforward, tasty and well-aged Scotch. There's stuff out there that is bigger, more dramatic, a slap to the face of exciting flavors. But for what this sets out to do it pulls it off perfectly. Smooth, rich and pleasant, it almost feels old school in a way when everything didn't have to be uber-proofed with crazy barrel finishes. There's some nice warm sherry influence but it's still super malty and caramel-rich with some nice malty sweetness. I will admit that I'm a total proof whore, and to my jaded palate it's maybe a smidge thin so I'm glad it's bottles at 46%, because anything less would water it down too much and ruin it.

I feel like it‚Äôs basically a poor(er) man‚Äôs Glendronach. While not quite as full and rich, there are a lot of similar notes and it‚Äôs around 2/3 the price of Allardice.
Great review. I agree almost entirely. I particularly appreciate the way the sherry comes through without dominating the entire experience. Really gets the balance right.
Think you nailed this one. Depending on where you live, you can grab this for under $70. It's one of the few 18 year bottles I consistently buy because of the value + quality it represents. Also what I recommend to newcomers for an accessible and well aged purchase.
I was starting to feel kind of jaded scoring this a 7, I was thinking to myself ""honestly what more does a Scotch need to do to score nearer a perfect 10? Because this is good."" But you're right, Glendronach 18 is a good example of what a Scotch can do better in a similar category. This stuff is good but Glendronach 18 is just ridiculously decadent and luxurious, very rich and dense flavor at the same 46% ABV. I scored the Allardice an 8 for reference.

Agreed that the price of this stuff is the real stunner here, I can get this for about $80 which is only slightly more than some 10-12yr OB's. I've recently been finding that my cupboard lacks stuff that is more accesible to beginners, I think this is a good affordable one to keep around that will knock noobs socks off.
>basically a poor(er) man‚Äôs Glendronach.

By me the Tomatin 18 is $99, while Glendronach 18 is up to $219. What prices are you getting?
And for the same price in my area, a better option than Glenfiddich 18.
Balance is the key word for me here, and yeah I totally agree that the sherry compliments the Scotch without being the main attraction. I don't think they really needed to emphasize ""Oloroso"" on the label, most older Scotch OB's in my experience have a balanced sherry influence like this. I think emphasizing ""Oloroso"" shows the state of the industry, where people seem to like interesting wine influences and information about what's in the bottle.
Thanks for reading! I think I'll be getting a bottle, I agree it feels like it will be really accessible and delicious for newcomers and for a great price.
I personally hate all glenfiddich. They just aren‚Äôt my thing.
I really like tomatin 18 a lot. A lot of it is the value but it‚Äôs smooth and tasty and like others have said, great to impress beginners. It‚Äôs also great for a good tipple of something straightforward every once in a while.
Olorosso vs PX are completely different profiles though. I'd definitely like to have as much knowledge as they are willing to provide.
Glenfiddich is a profile I like, but their 40% bottlings suck.
I agree, I appreciate all the info a Scotch can provide. It's just unusual for an 18yr standard bottling, so I think it's interesting they included it and I think it's smart marketing
Nail on head.
I feel like because Tomatin is such a big producer they aren't appreciated but they are bringing the integrity bottlings and I'll always stand by them for that. It's smart marketing but only for the anoraks and hobbyists. Hopefully it helps push the industry in the right direction."

*****

**Glenlivet 10yr, SMWS 2.106 ""devilishly opulent,"" Oloroso butt finished in 1st fill PX butt, 61.3%**

**Nose:** Sticky burnt caramel, hot peppery spice, vanilla, big green apple, smooth earthy sherry, grassy malt, sweet fruits, musty wood, chocolate toffee. Surprisingly malty with a nice burnt and musty fruitiness

**Taste:** More sherry flavor than the nose, but it's integrated and balanced with the rich malt and not what I would call a ""sherry bomb."" Sweet burnt fruits, balanced peppery spice, sticky-sweet caramel, cherry syrup, thick caramel maltiness, smooth musty fruit, nice woodiness.

**Finish:** Takes off with hot cherry syrup and peppery spice, long sweet finish with a healthy dose of zingy heat to keep it interesting. The sickly-sweet cherry and spice lingers for a long time

*****

Honest question about these, I've seen quite a few 8-12yr sherried Glenlivets from several different bottlers now, and they all seem to be super high 60%+ ABV. What's the deal with that? Anyways this is isn't as overly hot as you would think. It's a nice & richly balanced sherried Scotch that keeps it's malty Livet character (somewhat) in tact. The sherry is earthy and sweet, smooth and rich, but well integrated & not in-your-face at all. Right up my alley since I prefer a lighter sherry influence. The spice heat does build a little too brashly especially on the finish, but it's still delicious even if I would prefer it a little more decadent and sweet.

Fine, I‚Äôll pick up a bottle of a Signatory Glenlivet. I see my Binny‚Äôs has some signatory 10 year old fisrst fill sherry butt an I‚Äôve looked at 5his for a while. It better be good mr. buckydean.
> I've seen quite a few 8-12yr sherried Glenlivets from several different bottlers now, and they all seem to be super high 60%+ ABV. What's the deal with that?

Been wondering that too.

Pure speculation: some combination of higher than normal cask entry proof, and/or perhaps maturation in a climate controlled warehouse space that is less humid than normal.

Whatever they did, it seems to work. From just the OB bottlings I never would have guessed Glenlivet could be this good at this young of an age. Your notes are strikingly similar to what I've gotten from similar Signatory bottles.

Nice review, cheers
I cant vouch for it haha. My last IB Glenlivet was really good as well, but it was insane. I drank it blind and guessed it was a bourbon:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/bqns8j/review_93_glenlivet_11_signatory_the_whisky/
>I never would have guessed Glenlivet could be this good at this young of an age.

I've always been a fan of Glenlivet actually, it was my first single malt and I still think the 12yr is a decent beginner bottle. But I'm biased :)

High entry proof was my thought as well, but from what I understand they do that for Scotches that are going to be aged a long time so they don't drop too low. Maybe there's cost benefits you might be getting by upping the ABV and getting more bottles per barrel, but that kind of goes out the window when you bottle at cask strength I would think.

It raises more questions for me that I've never fully understood about independent bottlers. Do they barrel and age their own stuff? Does SMWS and Signatory have their own aging warehouses, or do they buy aged barrels? Do they get bulk spirit and barrel it themselves, or do they buy stuff already barreled? I imagine the answer is probably all of the above depending on different distilleries and situations.
Ha, it‚Äôs 46% abv. That said, I‚Äôm diving in, life‚Äôs short.
>I've always been a fan of Glenlivet actually, it was my first single malt and I still think the 12yr is a decent beginner bottle. But I'm biased :)

Personally I prefer Glenfiddich in the younger OB bottlings, 12-15 yo, and Glenlivet in the older stuff 18+.

> I imagine the answer is probably all of the above depending on different distilleries and situations.

That is my understanding. I think the larger & older and more established IB's have much larger sets of long maturing casks which they purchased shortly after distillation, and thus have complete control over the maturation of, than do the younger upstart IB's.

What is interesting IMHO about your example here is that it comes from SMWS, a different IB from Signatory - the latter is where I've seen most of these middling age high ABV Glenlivets coming from."
"Review #136, Henry McKenna 10yr single barrel, bottled in bond",,https://i.redd.it/c5j7w6pyneg41.jpg,"**Henry McKenna 10yr single barrel, Bottled in Bond, 50%**

**Nose:** Orange, rich warm oak, nice mild spice, musty wood, vanilla, caramel, light cherry zing. A straightforward mellow oaky Bourbon nose with just the right amount of sweetness and spice zing, delicious.

**Taste:** Sweet lively corn, cherry, vanilla cream, nice big spice kick that never gets too rowdy, clean toasted oak, menthol. It's sweet and lively but stays friendly and incredibly balanced overall. Just a pleasure to sip on with big bold flavors that never get out of hand.

**finish:** Sweet spice, Bourbon corn, mild hot cherry, has a nice little kick but never gets too hot

*****

This stuff drinks like Quintessential Bourbon, with a very approachable and balanced kind of complexity. It's sweet with lots of cherry and Bourbon corn but there's also plenty of big mellow oak and spice, none of it ever gets too big or overwhelming. Thoroughly delicious and pleasant, it just tastes so damn *right*. It's a shame this has gotten so crazy and hard to find, but it's not a big surprise. Maybe it's just my personal preferences showing but this bottle definitely tastes like something special, unlike some other hyped up stuff out there (looking at you Blantons, Rock Hill Farms, and Weller SR).

Nice. I just bought another bottle of this tonight even though I didn't *need* it. I left my name at a local store after they said they didn't have any, thinking I'll never hear from them again. One month later I get a random call that said, ""hey! Just got a case in if you still want it!"" Made my day!
Always down to buy this when I see it at MSRP.
Is that monkey drinking Campari?
There is some wild variation on this one due to the single barrel. The one I have is solid, but nothing amazing. My buddy has one that he hates and another buddy has one that he loves more than most of his other bottles. It is a big swing.
Picked up one of these yesterday as they were stocking it. I walk in and the guy quickly asks if I'm a bourbon guy. Yes. He taps the shelf and says here you go. The impression was, you're in the right place at the right time and this is what you want. I'm kind of new to this scene and this is my first hard-to-find bottle. So, it was pretty cool and exciting. I felt lucky.

I've heard so many good things and some not so good things honestly. Tried it. Loved it. It was delicious. Guess I got a good barrel (7762 on 12/14/09). I'm not going to post my notes because honestly, I don't have a good pallet for dissecting the profile and picking out flavors but I will say, it was a worth the $54 I paid. Glad I stopped by for no particular reason other than to see what they might have.
I love the review, but RHF at $50 is a delicious bourbon...I've never done a blind with it, but that would be enjoyable.

In my mind RHF is possibly better than Hank McKenna (love Hammerin' Hank)) and right up there with the best 100 proofers.
It's just some silly poster I've had forever. If you google mokey drinking poster you can find it
I've gone through a few bottles over the years but they were too far apart from each other to remember any differences. That's interesting though, it would be cool to do a sbs with different barrels.
Glad you got to try it, it's a shame it has gotten so hard to find because it used to be a solid sleeper bottle that was great for beginners. It practically happened overnight last year when somebody named it whiskey of the year. Bottles that had been just sitting around for years were suddenly rare and expensive :(
It's been a while, but I remember not caring for it much. Maybe I was a little harsh calling it out like that in my review, everyone's got their own tastes
Isn't that the beautiful thang about this whole thang? The differences are what make the world go round.

That being said, I really like HM 10 yr Bib.  Unlike many folk out here, I've yet  to have a ""bad"" bottle.

I must be very lucky or there is something else afoot going on 'round here."

**Glen Scotia 2003 ""Campbeltown Malts Festival 2019"" 15yr, Rum cask finish, 51.3%**

**Nose:** light, sweet and peaty. Gentle(yet big) briny peat, creamy vanilla, brown sugar, banana fruit, toffee, briny funk, mild medicinal notes.

**Taste:** Caramel, gentle briny peat, sweet vanilla, creamy sweet pastry malt, mild fruitiness, campbeltown funk. Smooth and gentle, with clean sweet peat and hint of briny funk.

**Finish:** Friendly barrel char, gritty peat, dark brown sugar sweetness. Light, peaty charred sweetness

*****

This is nice stuff, It's an interesting sweet and mild kind of peat. It drinks like the standard 15yr bottle but with a nice mild peat influence and more creamy sweetness. It does come off a little too light and gentle, it practically drinks like a 46% Scotch but that's not a horrible thing I guess even if I was hoping for a little more. Everything here is tasty and well-executed even if it could use a little more depth or action. Despite the ""Cask Strength"" proudly displayed on the box, I will probably drink this more when I'm in the mood for something lighter. Not a must-buy, but I enjoy it and don't regret the purchase at the price ($70 at K&L)

Yeah, it's nothing outstanding. But at $70 it's one of the cheaper non bourbon cask Campbeltown that I'm aware of, so when you want campbeltown this is a cheapish solution.
Sounds pretty tasty to me. Love a good sweet peat Dram. Sounds like a good easy sipper. I've been looking at this one at KL as well. Hope to try it eventually.
It's just so light and uneventful, honestly I would skip it given another chance. At least see if you can try it first."

The Cracklin‚Äô is just really off profile MGP.  Still a great barrel but very unique.  The Chi Edition was not a private pick.  It was distributed to a lot of stores in Chicagoland.  I got it at a grocery store (Woodmans).  The rumor I heard and I want to emphasize rumor, was that the Chi was a blend of 3 barrels that just missed the cut for Boss Hog.  I can not confirm that but what I can confirm is that it is an excellent bottle.  At about the same time the Chi hit Chicagoland Binnys got 4 barrels of MGP whistlepig - Cracklin, Trotters, Chump Chop, and Fatback.  I have all 4 and a couple Chi‚Äôs bunkered so one day I‚Äôll need to do a SBS of all 5.  The consensus in Chicagoland was that Chump Chop was the best of the bunch, slightly edging out the Chi.  I‚Äôve got one Chump bunkered.  When I open it I will set a round aside for you.  All 4 of the Binnys picks were fantastic. This post inspired me to pour myself a Trotters. Cheers!
I'm a Rye fiend, with WhistlePig single barrels and MGP Rye being some of my favorite Whiskey out there. So I thought this would be a really fun SBS. These were drank blind, side by side. I'm not sure where ""The Chi"" 13yr MGP one was from but I'm assuming somewhere in Chicago. Samples courtesy of u/Chardogg

*****

**(1)**

**Nose:** Beautiful clean mint and evergreen, toffee, black liquorice, chocolate and sweet vanilla, pastry, smooth char. Sweet and clean yet rich and toasted

**Taste:** Explodes with caramel, complex baking spices and spicy Rye action. Sweet char, vanilla, dark toffee, rich toasted wood. It just explodes and coats the mouth with vibrant Rye flavor, this is fucking delicious.

**Finish:** Keeps building, huge and complex til the end. Brash toasted wood and Rye spice, hot cherry, Sweet barrel char and huge Black liquorice Rye Spice. It's so vibrant and alive, delicious stuff.

*****************************

**(2)**

**Nose:** A little more gritty and toasted but still a clean, rich Rye. Gritty barrel char, chocolate, dill, toffee, green apple, clean rich toasted wood, brash spicy Rye. Incredible nose.

**Taste:** A hot, delicious slow burn of rich mouth-numbing Rye flavor, hot cherry and mean Rye spice, orange citrus kick, cinnamon, minty undercurrent, brash spicy heat that attacks the palate. 

**Finish:** Builds big and hot with huge spicy Rye, cherry cinnamon red-hots, brash spicy burn

******************************

These are both delicious, but there's 2 things I'm pretty confident of here: (2) is the MGP, and (1) is my favorite. 

(1) is beautiful, amazingly complex and well-crafted. It pops with vibrant minty Rye notes and spice that interplays beautifully with richer chocolatey wood and sweet char. It explodes with delicious Rye flavor and dances on the tongue, but does it in a very clean and effortless way. 

(2) is brash and hot, it's a huge spicy Rye that attacks the palate. I think it might lean towards being overly hot and unbalanced, but I'm a sucker for a fierce Rye and it really works for me. 

Score: 

(1) **10**

(2) **8**

**Reveal:**

(1) >!WhistlePig 10 single barrel, Binny's ""Crackling"" 122.6/61.3%!<

(2) >!WhistlePig 10 single barrel, ""The Chi"" 13yr MGP 119.7/59.85%!<

The fierce action of (2) would normally be exactly my kind of jam, but there's just no denying the quality of (1). Barrels like (1) are the Rye dragon I'm constantly chasing, the kind of barrel I'm hoping to find when I spend $100 on a pick. These are a couple of excellent Rye samples for sure. I'm so happy to have tried an amazing MGP Rye like this, and even happier that it was upstaged.

Oh wow, that's quite the Chicagoland story. The chi tasted distinctly alberta to me fwiw, its partly why I was so sure about my guesses. But maybe I was just looking for differences so who knows. Its delicious whatever it is. I dont know if maybe 10/10 was a little too generous, but I kept thinking to myself "" if this isnt perfect than what is?"" Like just how much more could I possibly expect from a whiskey, I enjoyed it so damn much. Thanks again
I saw a Whistlepig Chi bottle that's 120.3 proof - have you had that one?
Thanks, and looking forward to it. Go take care of those littluns
I really appreciate the offer, but just an FYI trading is not allowed on Reddit. Reddit will ban you without warning, even in PM's :(

Again thank you, I wish things were more lax here like they used to be.
Yeah they really are, I love whistlepig rye
The one he reviewed was the 2018 Chi Edition.  There is a 2019 Chi edition that is Alberta I believe. I haven‚Äôt tried it.
Thanks for the heads up. Didn‚Äôt think samples were a problem.
Isn't everything now Alberta? Is it still possible to find an MGP Whistle Pig on the shelf?
 Thanks, I saw it at Plum but since I generally don't like Alberta rye, I skipped it.
IS the 4th BossHog MGP or Alberta?
My understanding is that everything is now Alberta.  I think it‚Äôs highly unlikely to find an MGP Whistlepig on the shelf but not outside the realm of possibility.
That's my understanding as well. Going to sit in on a barrel pick which I know is going to all be Alberta.

Still, it's refreshing to see a review where the Alberta distillate trumped the MGP. I have two WP store picks (Alberta) and both are pretty darn tasty.
I picked up one of the recent Alberta Binnys Whistlepigs.  Cotechino I think was the name.  It is very good.  

Let me know when the barrel pick you sit in on ultimately comes to town.  If it‚Äôs not a private pick.
I currently have Binny's ""Snowball"" and a Garfield's pick. I lean towards the Garfield's, but that can change by the hour.

The pick isn't a done deal, but the samples are  coming in Thursday. I hopefully will get to participate. Store pick. Will let you know. I talk about the store frequently so it's not a surprise.
Nice. Yeah, I think I know the store then.
I guess I need to revisit my Binny snowball pick I forgot all about after I opened it,didn‚Äôt really hold my interest very long."

**Smooth Ambler Old Scout Bourbon (MGP) single barrel, 10yr, by Sarah, 56.5%**

**Nose:** Candied orange, big herbal spice, fruity cherry, toffee, clean oak char and deep toasted wood. Lots of vibrant fruity and herbal notes but overall remains very balanced and thick

**Taste:** Explodes with big herbal Rye spice and sticky-sweet cherry, this could easily be confused for a Rye. Delicious root beer char, vanilla, orange, sweet corn, fruity, menthol, clean and tasty toasted oak, chocolate, light earthy tobacco. Incredibly complex, the flavors are delicious and just so much fun.

**Finish:** Finish builds even brighter and sweeter than before. Sweet corn sugar, cherry candy, vanilla, root beer char, leaves the mouth tingling with tons of clean herbal spice and menthol.

*****

Easily described in 2 words: Sweet and fun. It's bright, fruity, and vibrantly sweet with tons of herbal spice that easily could have passed as a Rye in a blind tasting. Bright, complex flavors effortlessly explode and flow on the palate, but at the same time it maintains an extremely rich and balanced character with lots of friendly oak. Incredible stuff. I just bought a 12yr Smoke Wagon Single Barrel which is also MGP juice, I sure hope it can at least get close to this quality.

Man Old Scout was the best at picking out MGP Barrels. I recently stockpiled up on Smoke Wagon 12 year single barrels as well, they're absolutely delicious too! Please report back when you have had a chance to compare. I haven't had a cask strength Old Scout in a couple years, although the Smoke Wagon stuff seems to be just as good from what I can remember.
Sounds like you did enjoy this one, like many MGP juice single barrels from Smooth Ambler, it‚Äôs always at least really solid and some of them are stellar. Had fun with this one, I have two 10y opened at the moment, both are amazing. Thx for the review, cheers!

I've yet to try any famed SAOS ryes or Bourbons, but all the reviews I've seen are glowing.
Belle Meade aint too shabby at the MGP game either.
I'm usually more into the Rye from MGP, I never pursued the Bourbon as much but I heard good things about the Smoke Wagon so I decided to go for it. K&L had 2 barrels, one was described as more earthy and oaky but I went for one that was described as more fruity and sweet. Hopefully it's something like this bottle!
Yeah I've heard that sarah bottles are highly sought after by some people, even though it may or may not mean a whole lot. Dont know a whole lot about the subject
I wish I could say it was a hype train and overrated, but in my limited experience they live up to their reputation. I never actually had a bottle of any single barrels unfortunately, just some samples.
Man do I miss the old 7yr MGP SAOS had
Nice! I picked one of those up too! Which barrel did you get?
So they say. FWIW I recently opened an 11 year she picked and it‚Äôs gotta he the best MGP product I‚Äôve currently got open but that could just be pure luck.
It just doesn't seem the same to not be able to see the fantastic SAOS bourbon on the shelf at a decent price.  I loved that stuff.
5633, but I haven't opened it yet. I've always passed up MGP Bourbon, I gave in this time and at the price I sure hope it's good! Have you tried yours yet?
What's the story with sarah? Did she work at the distillery and do picks? I dont think she worked for a store right?
Was such a good bottle for the $
I have two different Smoke Wagon 12yr picks open at the moment and they're both amazing. One is from the Total Wine here in Vegas and the other is from a store called Liquor World. My KL order is sitting and waiting in Hollywood at the moment but I know its going to be good cause the guys at K&L really know how to pick their stuff.

**Finish:** Long complex finish. Lots of floral notes and interesting spice that is big yet mild, vanilla, leaves with spice-y brash oak

This is an interesting one, I really like it. It has some of the harshness I often get from MM but it's reeled in and presented in an interesting and enjoyable way. Tons of complex and interesting spice notes that add a lot more than just peppery heat, goes well with the creamy sweetness. I might be a bigger fan of Maker's Mark if I could try more like this.

**Nose:**Sweet vanilla cake, briny peat, light char, menthol, caramel, medicinal notes, funky wood, ashy char. Still a peat monster but it's a bit more light and gentle overall and it has some medicinal band aid notes missing from (1).

**Taste:** Sweet char and vanilla, mild peppery heat, clean briny peat, fruity malt, clean caramel, menthol. Very clean and sweet but still has that peaty Islay onslaught.

**Finish:** Sweet vanilla, malt, clean smokey-sweet finish with a light root beer char

These are definitely different beasts, and definitely both delicious. (1) is more of a familiar ""mean 'n peaty"" Islay beast, it's on the meatier side with darker charred oak/burnt rubber notes and some mean peat. (2) is still an Islay peat monster, but it's a little softer and sweeter with a more balanced and clean smokiness. They are both delicious in their own way, and honestly I'm having trouble picking a favorite. Usually I would go for (1), it satisfies the peatlust a little better with the darker charred peat notes. But at the 46% ABV we get here, I think (2) performs a little better. It's just a little more flavorful and complex, and the sweet peaty char works really well.

sounds like #2 (the 07) is the winner
I did a similar comparison of L7 vs L12 (or whatever the terminology would be) and had similar conclusions. They‚Äôre both good and share a lot of familial resemblance, but are also noticeably different.
sc list each distillaries weight of the Barley Grist. I guess the milling of the of the barley. Ardbeg seem have this very fine barley character to other malts. I'm not sure in old days the cearals had more gluten too.
>ultra clean, balance, licorice, engine oily, puff smoke

Yeah that sounds like this one, I wrote menthol notes for both but it was a little different in each one and licorice sounds pretty accurate.

What do you mean by grit weight?
Kind of, but I would gladly drink either
Are those the different batches of Ardbeg? I looked, and my bottle has the code L70139 on it

**Nose:** Light nose with malt and wood presence. Thick caramel and malt, rich funky wood, floral honey, cereal notes, mild spice. A straightforward malty nose, bit on the dry side with some mildly bitter wood but very nice. 

**Taste:** A bit zingy on the palate with spice and mildly brash wood, settles nicely into toffee, big rich malt, lightly sweet vanilla, spice, light floral notes, dry and earthy wood notes.

**Finish:** Rather short finish. Sweeter vanilla icing emerges briefly, malty, spice and earthy wood.

*****

A tasty straightforward malty Scotch, the wood is *almost* too dry and tannic but it manages to stay well balanced, rich, and pleasant overall. It's a bit of a darker malt bomb, I prefer them a little more sweet and fruity but maybe that's just personal preference. When I'm in the mood for something more dark and oaky that retains it's light and malty character this does nicely.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs about the tastes of the folks who pick their casks or what they expect their customers will enjoy (maybe some of both?), but I feel like a lot of K&L picks drifts towards too much oak territory. Sometimes the spirit is enough to stand up (e.g. the 16 year old peated Bunnahabhain from a while back), but other times it‚Äôs just a mess.
This sounds really good. Not sure about the bitter wood note though. That wasn‚Äôt to distracting, was it? I‚Äôll have to track down one of these IB, CS, bourbon cask aged mortlachs and give it a go. Great review.
75% of everything we bottle is in 2nd or 3rd fill barrel. When we find a first fill with a big spirit like mortlach it‚Äôs interesting and people enjoy it. This one just needs some air and a drop of water and all any edginess is gone. But not everyone likes 4th fill spirit driven Malts. You‚Äôre generalizing and clearly not familiar with the vast majority of the stuff we bottle.
I've been finding more and more that I have much better luck with sherried picks from K&L. That may partly just be because most picks there are refill barrels nowadays, and for whatever reason refill sherry barrels seem to work better than refill Bourbon barrels to me. Or it could just be the tastes of the pickers like you said. It's a shame because I love a good malty Scotch. To be fair though they do a LOT of Scotch picks and I obviously haven't been able to try them all.

Happy cake day!
Dude, why do you feel the need to defend the honor of your picks every time someone doesn‚Äôt like them?
Hey, sorry to drag you off-topic a bit, but are y'all ever going to start shipping booze outside CA again?
Why not? But he did like it. This was a good review. You chose to come in and generalize about our picks cause you‚Äôre for whatever reason not into me or us or what we‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs just not informed properly - if anything I have had more and more whiskies that are less oaky and more spirit driven in the passed two years because stocks are tight and distillers hold onto first and 2nd fill barrels whenever possible. 

Likewise when I sell a whisky and tell anyone who buys it to add water and people review it here without water - it does a disservice to the reader who might absolutely love a whisky, but is now biased against it because someone reviews something without bothering to explain that. 

Also I have nothing else to do and I‚Äôm an insomniac.
Considering it‚Äôs illegal to ship spirits over state lines as per the section 2 of the 21st amendment, it‚Äôs unlikely without intervention from the Supreme Court. 

‚ÄúUS Constitution. Amendment 21. Section 2. The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.‚Äù

So it‚Äôs really fedex on the hook in other states and by proxy us. Because CA is our biggest market we can‚Äôt risk running afoul of their rules. That said each state makes there own rules and a group of motivated citizens can create change on the state level. New Hampshire and North Dakota have both set up systems where we collect excise taxes for them and in exchange they authorize carriers to allow shipment over state lines. If North Dakota can do it so can you!
Hm. As I understand it, Nebraska allows importation of spirits, and has for some time.  Dunno if [this](https://lcc.nebraska.gov/sites/lcc.nebraska.gov/files/s1taxinstructions%20Revised%204-2013.pdf) (PDF) is relevant WRT the taxes.

My curiosity is piqued...
Each state is different so maybe there aren‚Äôt the proper reciprocal agreements or something. I‚Äôll look into NE.
Looks like this license is for producers not out of state retailers. Lots of hoops to jump through and specific brands need to register.

*****

**2003 Russell's Reserve 10yr 101, 50.5%**

**Nose:** Rich, warm and inviting. Warm spice tingle, chocolate orange, caramel, vanilla char, rich toasted wood, mildly zippy cherry cola, menthol. So balanced and rich

**Taste:** Smooth mint and cherry cola, vanilla char, cool orange, pleasant spice tingle, it builds to a big rich flavor but stays so smooth and pleasant. Toffee, warm vanilla, smooth chocolatey wood. Effortlessly rich and delicious.

**Finish:** Builds to moderately bright Sweet cherry and balanced spice, settles into chocolate orange and smooth wood, so fucking tasty.

*****

Wow, this is so good. It strikes a ridiculously perfect balance of sweet, spice, and chocolatey smooth oak, and pulls it off in an effortless way like it's not even trying that hard. Just a great fucking Bourbon pure and simple, rich and complex yet smooth and balanced. Wild Turkey always has an effortless quality to me, but these older bottlings take it to another level. Hard to put into words, it just tastes so *right.*

EDIT: That last drop in the glass, that you can see rolling around at the bottom but won't make it to your mouth when you tilt the glass: I threw in a few drops of a HiTime WhistlePig 10yr single barrel, swished it around, and holy shit it was DIVINE.

Nice review. I have had this several times and enjoy it. It is miles better than the current RR10.

My only issue is that the secondary price is way too high. This goes for more than 80s 101/8 and not far from split label. At those prices, not worth it. If you find it for a good price though, definitely solid juice.
Nice notes. I'm glad you enjoyed it! I'm still nursing the last bit of this bottle.
Thanks. I've never bought anything secondary or followed any of that stuff, I just try to enjoy samples I'm lucky enough to get. How much do these go for, and how much are the 80's stuff and split label generally?
Oh wow, I bet you are haha. This was from almost 2 years ago (march 2018). Thank you so much for the chance to try it.
Pretty sure they go for around these prices. 

$350-400 for Late 80s early 90s 101/8 

$450 or so for this 

$475-550 for split
I guess that's not crazy when you consider that BTAC can go for that, and dusty Turkey is more of a once in a lifetime thing. I passed on Stagg for $300, but some of these would be more tempting since it's not around anymore. Not saying I'd do it, but it would be more tempting
100%. I always encourage my whiskey friends to trade their BTAC for Dusties. You can walk into maybe 50 bars in San Francisco and find BTAC, it's there if you want it. Dusty turkey is amazing and far more unique and harder to find in bars. Also every time some one drinks one, there is one less in the world. BTAC is great but will come out again next year."
"Review #130, Stagg jr batch 1",,https://i.redd.it/uo9qiutrdtb41.jpg,"The very first batch of Stagg jr, released in the fall of 2013. Sample courtesy of u/Randimosity

*****

**Stagg Jr batch 1, 67.20%**

**Nose:** Surprisingly light nose for the crazy ABV, doesn't have much of a presence. Caramel, sweet zingy cherry, mellow spice tingle, bitter tannic oak, sweet vanilla. 

**Taste:** A huge, unpleasant bitter cherry syrup just explodes and takes over right away, wtf haha. Tastes like black liquorice and cherry cough syrup served with a rusty spoon. There's some corn, toasted oak, spice, nicer burnt sweet notes, but it is all overshadowed by that unbalanced and astringent cherry cough syrup note. 

**Finish:** The bitter cherry and black liquorice keeps building and rides out into the finish with some menthol spice, it mellows and sweetens up a little but but overall it leaves an unpleasant bitter oak taste in the mouth.

*****

I've heard lots of bad stuff about this batch over the years, but I feel like sometimes things just get repeated and overblown. Not the case here, this is just unpleasant. I've had plenty of Bourbon that is basically good but maybe has some off-putting notes, but not quite like this. It's just this single, discordant bitter cherry and black liquorice flavor that crashes through any other pleasant notes there might be and steals the whole show. I'm a big fan of the later Stagg jr batches, #6 was my first barrel proof Bourbon and what took my love of Whiskey to the next level. So I'm glad they got their shit together after this.

general wisdom is the first release of any new range is supposed to be the best because they are trying to build the reputation, not here it seems
Hah dang. I wonder if the first couple of Jr batches were GTS rejects, having the age but just a bunch of bad qualities. Would be super curious to try the first couple of batches.
I can see the appeal.  Man, this line is pretty good, there is no way that its that bad.  

*Actually tries it* 

Oh wow that is pretty bad. This would be fun as hell to try, even if just to see how far they've come in nailing down the profile that they want.
Great review! Earliest I had was a batch 7 and it was also a hot spice bomb. This sounds even worse! Appreciate the post as always!
Batch 2 tasted pretty bad too
This batch is basically infamous for how bad it is but that just makes me want to try it even more haha. I just want to see how far they‚Äôve come
When it first came out it had very mixed reviews but I always loved my bottle. Sure, it was more astringent and oaky than most but it made a great bourbon on the rocks. Stagg Jr Batch 1 is the bourbon that got my girlfriend on the band wagon. I felt like batch 2 was worse because it was less ABV but more astringent and boozy. I'll admit that it wasn't until sometime later that they seemed to find the magic with the right amount of cherry cola thing.
Yeah exactly, I just had to see for myself. It actually didn't even remind me a whole lot of current Stagg jr, but it has been a while. It reminded me a bit of FRPS, they tend to have a really strong cherry cough syrup flavor that is similar to me, but I enjoy it in those. I think it might be time to open a Stagg jr now, I have a batch 8 waiting.

EDIT: u/LIFOanAccountant I went ahead and opened my batch 8. Wow, what a difference. It's more of a dark cherry cola here, still super syrupy but it integrates with the all the oak and spice and dark flavors way better. It's a wall of flavor. I almost opened this earlier to review the batch 1 and 8 as a blind side-by-side, but I don't think it would have been worth the trouble since the difference is so apparent. This batch 8 is almost 3 years old now fwiw
Thanks dude! So I take it you're not a fan of stagg jr in general then?
Oh boy, now I got new goals
Yep, when I had a chance to try some it was like a morbid curiosity that took over and I said ""oh yeah I want some of that"" haha. I knew about it's reputation, but I thought it might just be overblown. I went in expecting it to basically be decent but maybe too hot or not quite as good as later batches, Boy was I wrong! fun sample though for sure
I've only had 9 and 10, and both are pretty good and solidly consistent.  I would guess the first couple of batches just went horrendously before their QC allowed them to nail that dark cherry cola profile.
You have weird goals
I had a bottle of Batch 2 - to my palate it wasn't historically bad, just astringent and kind of spicy hot, like it was spiked with rubbing alcohol. It worked well in Old Fashioned cocktails (I'm not creative enough to make anything else). It's like the suits at BT were going for mind-blowing heat and proof and missed the point that GTS is so unique because it has clarity and structure, despite the proof."

**Four Roses Private Selection OBSV 11yr 10 mo, Bevmo, 50.8%**

**Nose:** Metallic cherry, caramel, lots of corn sweetness, mild spice, tannic toasted oak, nice menthol undercurrent. Pretty tame and simple nose, not bad but doesn't have a huge presence.

**Taste:** Sweet candy cherry, clean Bourbon corn, nice brash toasted oak, metallic caramel, chocolate, mild minty spice. Delicious flavors but it's lost a bit of it's ""oomph"" I think at the low ABV, which is weird because 50% isn't *that* low. Very drinkable and tasty though.

**Finish:** A kind of mild dark oak finish. Light friendly tobacco, sweet oak char, caramel, with some clean mint

*****

A great bottle in it's own right, but a bit of a letdown as a FRPS. I knew what I might be getting into with the low ABV, but I had to try it considering it's almost 12 years old. It's a delicious bottle, very sweet and toned down and not super oaky at all considering the older age, and super drinkable. It's just a *little* too toned down and simple. I wish I had a bottle of the standard single barrel to compare this with, because it's probably only slightly better but at twice the cost. A fun bottle still, I don't regret buying it at all. They don't all have to be bruisers!

have you ever had to rate anything a 1?
That drunken chimp in the background again...... üòÇ
I have an OBSV from Feb 2019 that is the same age and also at a low proof (52.6%). It's one of my favorites and I think I'd give it a 9 with your scoring. 

I wonder how similar they are? I might give it a go this evening and compare with your notes.

Edit: Alright, enjoying it now. I'm getting a lot of fruit (mostly citrus) and spice. Also getting very little oak but it is there if you look for it. Curious whether these barrels were tried alongside one another and which was picked first. I think yours is the lowest proof I've ever seen for a Private Selection aged over 10 years. Mine (at 105.2) is the lowest I have purchased.
Good question, I was actually just thinking about this recently. I don't think I've ever gone lower than a 4, maybe a 3. I generally review stuff from my own collection or samples I've intentionally acquired, so I don't end up with any ""bad"" Whiskies to review since I have a pretty good handle on my own tastes and know what to seek out.
That's awesome, glad you like yours more than I like mine. 52% is getting into a better barrel proof strength imo.
i gotcha, i just wanted to see if you had to pour any out! hahah
No never have haha. I will say that I'm a big fan of craft beer, and I have had to do it a few times with some beers. There's some pretty funky stuff out there."

**Nose:** Maple, musty wood, sticky-sweet toffee, beautiful sweet and rich oak notes that jump out of the glass. Rounded out beautifully by gritty barrel char, deeply toasted oak, vanilla, light menthol, and some bright floral sweetness.

**taste:** A hot zinger of a Four Roses, which is how I like them. Bright and sweet cherry syrup, zingy spice and menthol, shining caramel, sticky toffee, deep toasted oak, tobacco

**Finish:** Hot cherry and tons of lively spice, sweet vanilla. It oozes with lingering cherry cough syrup, light tobacco, and mouth-numbing menthol spice.

This is a perfect example of what I love about Four Roses Private Selects: tons of huge, action-packed flavor that keeps you on your toes. It is an unbalanced mess in the best way possible. All the complex flavors are so lively and bright and delicious so it just works, it's like chaos controlled. And they always seem to have this perfect level of toasted oak that is just right and rounds out all the brash and lively flavor beautifully. I know people complain about how these have gotten younger over the years, but I really like these brash young bottles. Don't get me wrong I love the smooth and balanced flavors of a well-aged 12+yr too, but I think they both have their place.

Oesq is my favorite.
This is my favorite bourbon next to Knob Creek 25th Anniversary. So good.
Great review and love the picture in the back!
Excellent review.  Q yeast strain is great, for my palate. 125ish proof is the sweet spot for 4R for me. I love their SiB products, and while the standard 100 proof offering is quite good, when you can get the 120+ stuff, it‚Äôs as good as anything you‚Äôll find on the market.
I agree, I generally have really good luck with the Q strain so it might be my jam. And the super high proof 60%+ bottles seem to always be good too. God I love this stuff!"

**Nose:** Rich wood notes of vanilla and musty wood, chocolate, metallic dark cherry, minty spice. Rich sticky caramel, butterscotch, tannic toasted oak, oak spice and menthol. Smooth, rich, and woody nose, really amazing. 

**Taste:** Oak and tannic wood hit kind of brashly, concentrated dark cherry cough syrup, brash spice and mint. Evens out but still stays lively with tannic wood, dark chocolate, creamy butterscotch, hot spicy cherry, charred oak, spice, lots of tobacco, vanilla. It's very oaky but that doesn't tell the whole story here at all, still plenty of familiar Four Roses action.

**Finish:** Cherry cough syrup and menthol bomb, slowly darkens into dark tobacco char and mellow tingling spice, long complex finish.

*****

Very oaky and a bit on the tannic side, but there's still lots of delicious Four Roses hot cherry and lively spice and some really nice creamy notes as well. Wonderfully complex and action-packed, but the bitter tannic wood notes sometimes intrude a little too much for my tastes and stop it juuust short of greatness. These have set a pretty high bar for me so it's a minor complaint, it's really a great Bourbon.

Sample is courtesy of u/jride57

*****

**Ardbeg Kelpie committee releas, 51.7%**

**Nose:** Strong briny peat, sea spray, tannic oak, chocolate, charred and toasted wood, vanilla. A simple yet intense nose, it's laser-focused briny peat and sweet charred wood.

**Taste:** Huge soft peat, smooth and woody, soft chocolate, vanilla icing, sticky caramel, dessert sweetness, intense boggy brine, ashy smoke, tannic wood notes that stay pleasant and well-integrated. Delicious chocolatey peat but never gets too intense or oaky.  

**Finish:** Gets meaner on the finish. Sweet char, vanilla, intense charred peat, tannic wood, tons of brine. Peat, brine, and smooth chocolate linger 

*****

It's softer and smoother than I expected but it works well. Lots of smooth chocolate wood and dessert sweetness with huge Ardbeg peat, the brine is off the charts and there's some bitter tannic wood but it all somehow stays mellow and balanced overall - for a cask strength Islay peat monster. Not quite the ""peat assault"" I look for in these, but it's a pleasantly oaky romp for Ardbeg.

Great review! Do you think you're able to pick out what effect the weird wood has on the whisky?
I really hope the standard release of this I have is close to as good as this one sounds.  I like a lot of the words you wrote in describing it.
Is that a 1 oz or 2 oz bottle?
The committee release is just the cask strength version of each years release, the standard bottle being 46%.
You can join the Ardbeg Committee which is basically like their fan club. Ardbeg have special releases every year which get offered to the committee first. The Kelpie was one of these bottlings, others include Drum and Grooves.
I think the fact that it was virgin oak has a big effect, lots of chocolatey and slightly tannic wood for a scotch. Still not as oaky as I would have thought. I dont have a lot of experience with virgin oak Scotch, so it's hard to say how this black sea oak might differ from other oak. Its maybe a bit more mellow than the American oak in Bourbon, but that could be a result of their blending or hiw it interacts with all the peat.

Awesome - glad to see you enjoyed it! Overall, i‚Äôm seeing people are generally big fans of this bottle, so i‚Äôm glad we did a good job! Nice review!
Nice review. I agree with all your notes. I think the team did a great job picking a barrel. It definitely tastes young to me, getting a lot of brighter, fruit and rye notes. For a four year though there's a nice amount of barrel notes. Hope we get a chance at some older barrels in the future.
I'm glad you enjoyed it. We did our best to pick a great barrel. Thanks for the review
Glad you enjoyed it, and enjoyed the writeup.   Unless they really bung things up, New Riff is going to have phenomenal product in about 3 years (they're already really good at 4 years).  It's gonna kill me to see them get tatered down the road because they have (relatively) small output, and there's no way they'll be able to keep up with demand without bumping up the price.
I need to know where you got the monkey print
Great review!

I hope folks don‚Äôt mind, but I have a dumb question. What is it about barrel selection programs at New Ruff and elsewhere that are so special? I mean, how can whiskey change so drastically just based on the particular barrel it‚Äôs aged in? How do selectors know which barrels will be better than others?

Hope that‚Äôs not too dumb of a question!

Edit: spelling / grammar
I got a bottle of this for Christmas and easily the best new bourbon I've tasted in quite a while. It tastes phenomenal, especially when you consider how young it is.
Just picked up a bottle of New Riff Single Barrel Rye for $50, and it‚Äôs one of the best ryes I‚Äôve had in a long time. The single barrel bourbon is next on my list, I‚Äôve just been on a rye kick.
Nice review and glad you enjoyed! The pick team had a fun time with this.  I can't wait to see what their products look like with some more age on them. 

Have you tried their SiB ryes yet?
Is it still possible to get this barrel pick somewhere?
where do you get things like this?
MGP deserves all the credit.
Long Live Apollo. Goodbye Reddit.
Got a bottle for Christmas.  On your scale I'd give it 8 - 9.  Taste is in the eye...er... tongue of the beholder.
You guys sure did. But I think next time instead of picking your favorite barrel, you guys should just bottle them all and let us decide ;)
Thanks. Agreed, love to see how this stuff develops with age. I was much more impressed with this than I was with the BiB Rye, and that's coming from a total Rye fiend. The barrel notes were really good on this, especially on the nose. I love that funky wood must
Y'all did a fine job, and it looked like lots of fun based on the update posts
You can probably find that image online and have a custom silk print made for that size, for $10 or so.
I've had it a long time, I'm not even sure where I got it lol.
No you're good man, ask away! I'm no expert but I'll do my best, maybe someone can correct me or add to this.

To get down to basics, wood is a living thing and therefore subject to variations and imperfections. Not all trees and not all parts of the same tree are gonna be identical. Then once the barrel is made, distillers can char the barrel to varying levels for different flavors. Even after all this, after the barrel is filled, warehouse location makes a difference. A barrel at the very top of a 5 story warehouse will get very hot and go through wider temp variations, so it will age differently than a barrel sitting in the more steady coolness at the bottom. The result of all this is interesting variations of flavors even if all the Whisky started out the same.

As far as ""which barrels will be better than others,"" that's highly subjective. Someone picking a barrel will taste several different barrels, and pick their favorite. My favorite might be different from your favorite, personal taste will come into it. As much as I like this New Riff barrel they selected, there might have been a different one I would have liked more. I've had barrel selects I didn't care for, but someone else loved it apparently. It's all part of the risk and fun.

EDIT: thanks for the bling!
No but I have the BIB rye, it's decent but I wasn't super impressed. I'm a rye fiend and I was hoping for more rye flavor from a 100% mashbill(I know, its partly malted rye). I wanna keep an eye on their distillery and try more stuff though, because it's the only new 100% stuff I know of so I'm hopeful.
No it is not available, sorry. They sold out pretty quick once they went on sale
This single barrel selection was done by the subreddit and sold to subscribers through Seelbachs. 

New Riff does distribute fairly well though, and more so by the month, so their core line expressions may be available at local stores near you soon, if they aren‚Äôt already.
From what I understand only their OKI bottlings are sourced from MGP, this stuff is their own distillate.
This bottle is definitely New Riff distillate.
Well, anything under the New Riff label is not MGP, it's New Riff's own distillate. They use a high rye mashbill, so that may be why it seems to be similar to Four Roses.
Haha I wish! I wanted far more than one, but New Riff is a busy place these days. 

that said, I think - given this suggestion you‚Äôve just given me - you‚Äôll be pretty stoked about what‚Äôs going down in 2020.
It was a great time!
It‚Äôs fabulous
Dude this was a great and educational answer! Thanks!
Spot-on answer.
Thanks, I figured it wasn‚Äôt available. A friend is going to pick me up a bottle in KY since New Riff is not available here in NC.
I see. It does say it on this bottle.
Oh really? I thought it was sourced. Wow 4 years tasting this good is fantastic. I‚Äôll buy more when I see it.
oh boy oh boy! I mean I was just poking fun, but I guess the demand is certainly there. Even only allowing 1 bottle per person these sold out quick. Can't wait to see it
You're fabulous
This is definitely New Riff distillate.
> I thought it was sourced. 

It was originally sourced until a year or so ago when they finally ran out then switched over to their own distillate.
yeah, we needed to be sure there was demand. gotta start slow, and perform smart. 

2020 will be fun.
That would explain it then
When do you normally announce these? I‚Äôm on this subreddit almost every day and totally missed the new riff announcement
u/303onrepeat is correct, but just to clarify, New Riff was bottling their sourced MGP stock under the OKI label. It's the same people that blended and bottles this MGP stock, but were keeping it under the OKI label to prevent confusion as to what brand was using sourced stock.
soon - they are always stickied so you shouldn‚Äôt miss them

This drinks more like one of the better entry-level Scotches out there in the $50-$60 price range. Decently rich and complex, and definitely a significant step up from the 12yr from what I remember. It's cool they went for 46% here too, it helps a lot I think.

I just tried this tonight and I think had similar conclusions. It‚Äôs nice, but nothing would indicate the age, or cost. Entry level decent scotch is a good comparison.
I find the the 12yr CS far better for around the same price and is my favourite from the standard range though some of the single casks are fantastic! Especially the FAH and the Palace bar and the dream casks. I haven‚Äôt tried any of the new American releases though.
Do you buy those little bottles at liquor stores?
I‚Äôve seen the mini shot bottles before but never with anything more expensive in it
I was about to say the same thing. 12 just as good, if not better, for less ¬£¬£
The majority of people seem to prefer the 12 CS to the 15 year, though I'm curious where they're around the same price.  Most of the US the 12 CS is significantly cheaper than the 15.  Around here the 12 CS is $70-$80, the 15 is $100-$120
They're just 2oz Boston rounds, and then I'm in a whiskey club that trades samples from our collections"
"Wasn't expecting much when a friend asked if I wanted a bottle of Scotch she inherited, imagine my surprise: 1983 Caol Ila 13yr 58.4%, SMWS 53.12 (review #122)",,https://i.redd.it/qi90y21ye7a41.jpg,"You selfless SOB!!
A little backstory: A friend of mine recently inherited some Scotch from a family friend that passed away, and wanted my opinion on the stuff. I wasn't expecting much, probably some shitty blend that people often post around here thinking it's worth money just because it's old. Imagine my surprise when I found out they were actually a slew of 90's SMWS bottlings. She opened this one and absolutely hated it, said it tasted like licking a campfire, and asked if I wanted it. Being the selfless friend that I am, I graciously offered to give it a loving home.

*****

**Caol Ila 1983 13yr, Scotch Malt Whisky Society, 58.4%**

**nose:** Fantastic nose that just jumps out of the glass at you: Amazing and intense peat, bandaids, huge sweet vanilla, brine, dark charred wood, rich chocolate, tons of menthol. Amazing Islay nose, the whole room will know what you are drinking lol.

**Taste:** A fierce Islay peat monster, this is no soft and tame Caol Ila. A wave of intense smoke and sweet vanilla, creamy caramel, funky root beer char, light menthol and bandaids, sweet toasted wood and oak spice, hot and smoky, vanilla icing, dark charred chocolate, some tart bitter fruit, darkens into char and light brine

**Finish:** Long finish that keeps building with sweet charred oak notes, vanilla, and intense peat. Excellent Islay finish.

*****

Wow. My experience with Caol Ila has always been good, sometimes a little ordinary or boring but basically a decent Islay that satisfies the ol' peatlust nicely. This is fantastic though, a mean Islay peat monster that easily earns it's place amongst the Islay greats. The intense nose alone almost earns this a perfect score, and luckily the malt delivers afterward. It still has a roundness and approachability to it that seems appropriate for a blending Scotch, just dialed up to 11 and it's an absolute beast. I don't remember ever being this impressed by a Caol Ila.

I can't help but wonder who this family friend was, what their life and tastes were like. I hope they would have been happy knowing this stuff is being enjoyed after their passing, when my time comes I hope the same for any bottles I might have. I'm extremely grateful for the chance to enjoy this bottle, cheers!

I recently got myself a bottle of Caol 12 and have been loving it since. Your's I am sure is a notch or two above!!
You lucky dog. Fantastic. This is a dream we all have, oh, and nice review oh, and happy cake day! So, just curious, what else did she have?
And this is why you drink instead of hoarding... you never know when your time is going to be.
This is like whisky version of penthouse forum.
I think your friend likes you. Like, like likes you.
What the fuck does bandaids taste like. Otherwise great review
Hot damn!
Niiiiooooce score!
That's a nice friend to have.  Sounds delicious.
Holy shit! Jackpot!
Wow. Lucky bastard :)
Stumbled upon this post through the subreddit suggestion. I‚Äôve never been a scotch guy or a liquor aficionado of any kind for that matter, but I found your story and review fascinating!
Hey is that a Monkey Shoulder ad on the wall? Sl√°inte!
‚ÄòLike licking a camp fire‚Äô. Ha!
Awesome review and great find! Happy cake day, too!
Not gonna lie it's pretty darn good, but the 12yr is a solid Islay
Right? Haha. It's no unicorn bottle or anything but it's an awesome surprise and then it just ended up being so fucking good. This has been in the works with my friend for a little while, I almost told you about it a few times but didn't wanna make a big deal until it was in my hands, just in case it didn't work out. Figured you'd find the post but I was gonna page you if you didn't show up.

The only other one I know of is a 1982 23yr Linkwood seen [here](https://imgur.com/uQgZjf9), she has it unopened. There's a bottle they opened with the boyfriend's dad, they don't know what it is but they said it's ""too strong"" and the dad just says ""it tastes like drinking diesel."" I offered to buy or trade it off them if they really don't like it, see how far it gets. Her dad has more bottles, don't know what or how many.
Came here to say this. A little hoarding is OK, but scotch isn't made to look at.
Lol underrated comment
Like Laphroaig
https://i.imgflip.com/2hllzm.jpg

You ever had Laphroaig before? It has a very distinct kind of rubbery band aid note, some pick it up as a medicinal smell or the inside of a hospital. Sounds gross, but it just works with all the peat and char flavors. It can show up in lots of heavily peated Scotches, but it's particularly strong in Laphroaig.
On Islay they're called plasters.
How cool! Thanks for visiting and reading, and thanks for the positive feedback! It's one thing pandering to all these other whisky fiends, but I'm glad you found it enjoyable too haha. So how did you find this, what is the ""subreddit suggestion?""
She meant it in a bad way, but she didn't realize those words will tug on the heart strings of any Islay fan lol
Thank you kindly!
Oh happy cake day
That‚Äôs cool. It‚Äôs always better to wait until the deal is done. Sounds great.
I‚Äôll bet that linkwood is good. Never had one but have hear good things about the distillery. Drinking diesel. Sounds like Loch Lomond  18, LOL. Good luck helping them out and taking it off their hands.
> It's no unicorn bottle or anything 

Not sure about that, sounds like a spectacular dram! Your tasting notes sounds like they went really heavy on the peat....is this typical for Caol Ila 80s/90s IB bottlings? I currently have the 12 and a cask strength IB 11 year (2008), both those are nowhere near your notes
birth year Glen Grant!
TIL: Bandaids... delicious!
But how do you know it tastes like bandaids?  Have you ever eaten a bandaid?
I would just call that hospital taste TCP.
While scrolling through my homepage, Reddit thought I might like this subreddit, and this was the first example post. My late grandmother really loved drinking scotch, and stumbling across this, I couldn‚Äôt help but think she would love if I read her different posts from the sub, especially this one. It made me think of her, and that made me happy :) I‚Äôm glad you found what seems to be a rare gem in the scotch world. It seemed to be perfect, considering it would have been wasted and thrown away had your friend(s) not known you. Maybe the universe just aligned :)
Right...in my mind I was like...she meant to insult...but she just described a fantastic scotch.  lol.  I can imagine you being told this  ""It taste like what?....touch nothing I'm leaving right now.  TOUCH NOTHING, IM ON MY WAY!""
Thanks!
I'm trying to be respectful of the fact that it's their stuff, but available if they don't want it. It's a fine line lol. That ""diesel"" bottle they have could be a fantastic Whisky and they just aren't used to cask strength Scotch.
I've had a few Caol Ila's, maybe 5-10, and I've never come across one quite this peaty or mean. But there are a lot of IB's out there, so who knows. I can't speak to how this might represent older Caol Ila vs modern bottlings.
Yeah I see what you're saying lol. I think it was just a really strong medicinal peat kind flavor, and it was so strong it just registered as ""band-aids"" while I was writing notes. Sometimes it goes into a stream of consciousness type thing during a review, and notes can feel right even if they don't make logical sense. 

**tl;dr** I could just as easily have said ""medicinal peat"" instead of band-aids, and maybe should have.
Yes
I feel as though when one ‚Äútastes‚Äù a whisky, it‚Äôs the culmination of what comes through on the palate and on the nose. So when someone says they taste band-aid, it‚Äôs the sensation coming from the nose while it hits the tongue that gives the flavor of band-aids. But that‚Äôs just my opinion.
Smells and taste are so closely related... A note in a whiskey can taste like something you've never tasted before, but have smelled before
You should try one.
For sure, that's a really cool way of looking at it thanks. And I don't think my homepage suggests subreddits, maybe because I opted out of the redesign and I'm still rocking the old school Reddit.

I'll drink one for your Grandma tonight, cheers!
Honestly I didn't wanna be too greedy or opportunistic, I gave it a little time and suggested she try it with a little water first to see if it helped. It was her family friend who passed away after all, and given to her. But she and her boyfriend insisted it was just foul and they didn't want it. Once I tried it and they saw how much I enjoyed it, it was a done deal. I'm gonna throw some samples from my collection their way as a thank you, see if I can't find something they like better.
Fine line, agreed. Very nice of them to give you a bottle.
I mostly stick to bourbon so I haven‚Äôt actually. Til"

"Review #125, High West Campfire",,https://i.redd.it/pijkwps6kv941.jpg,"This stuff is an unusual blend of peated Scotch, Bourbon, and Rye. The Scotch distillery is undisclosed, but the Bourbon and Rye are both sourced from MGP. The ratio and age are undisclosed as well. Sample courtesy of u/iDriveAvolvo

*****

**High West Campfire, 46%**

**Nose:** First impression is sweet and smoky. Honey, sweet vanilla, lots of clean mellow smoke, ashy char, toffee, cake frosting, Bourbony oak and spice. It noses like a light and sweet Islay Scotch but with just a bit of a Bourbon edge.

**Taste:** More Bourbon presence here than the Scotchy nose. Hot spice and Bourbon, smooth American oak, caramel, hot sweet cherry, sweet pastry malt, light smoke, lots of sweet Scotchy vanilla. The sweet smoky Scotch smooths out the harsher American Whiskey notes in a really cool way, it all feels surprisingly cohesive and smooth.

**Finish:** Smooth smoke, vanilla, char, sweet cherry and spice. Smoke and sweet vanilla linger in proper peated Scotch fashion.

*****

This stuff is delicious sure, but it's also really fucking interesting. It's such a crazy idea, seems like it would be weird or gross but they pulled it off really well. The flavors here all balance superbly in their odd pairings. And as a big fan of peated Scotch I have to say the peat notes are on point here. This isn't some thin or washed out smoke just for the novelty of putting it in a Bourbon, it tastes like it was a decent peated Scotch. All in all, I'd say it drinks more like Scotch. It feels like a sweet malty smoke bomb, but with lots of smoothed out American Whiskey and oak flavors that add some delicious and interesting flavors. Really cool stuff.

You really have to be a fan of peat, like you said you are, to enjoy this stuff. As someone who isn't, it pretty much overpowered everything else.
I get all three different components at different times with each sip. I call it the rollercoaster whiskey. It‚Äôs a wild ride.
I personally love this stuff. Grabbed a bottle a couple months ago and I‚Äôm over half way through it already. I LOVE Islay Scotches and this hits right there as a somewhat sweet scotch flavor. I can get for $40 everyday and sometimes on sale for less in my area. So it‚Äôs a no brainer pickup for me at that price point.
I'm not a huge fan of peat, but I do like an occasional Campfire to change things up a bit.
Must be some variation as I thought the bottle I had was mehh. I like bourbon, I like scotch/peaty scotch, I like Rye, but it (at least my bottle) came off like a mish mash where the profiles just didn't work. Maybe I'll have to try it again....
I like the idea of this but the implementation is lacking. I think if they used better ingredients and bottled it at a higher proof it could be great
I've been wanting to try this for awhile, not enough to commit to a bottle but I like Rye and Peated Scotch.
I will pray to find it on sale someday.

 They need to lower the price on the 375ml and give regular people a chance to try it.
I‚Äôve been debating about getting a bottle, but it runs about $70 in my state. Is it better than just a novelty? I love Islay and peated scotch
Yeah I could totally see that. I could totally see someone who likes Scotch/dislikes Bourbon enjoying this, but not the other way around so much.
One thing I forgot to mention in the review is that this sample is about 2 or 3 years old, so this batch is at least that old or possibly older if that makes any difference
It worked for me pretty well, and I like the 46%. Feels like a fun little nod since it's a common Scotch ABV. Like I said I think the Scotch is on point, but I could maybe see some bolder or better Bourbon in there. Almost makes me wanna experiment with it myself, I've got plenty of peated scotch and bourbon around.
Barrell Infinite Barrel may be around the same wheelhouse of this at that higher proof point.
Yeah I wish more bottlings would offer a 375ml for a chance to try it.
That's a tough call, looking at the comments here it seems kind of divisive even amongst fans of peated scotch. I think it's a fun one, but honestly I would rather spend that money on a proper scotch. If you get a chance you should definitely try it though.
If you could ever find it for $40, buy it instantly. I found mine for $50 and that seemed fair enough. Some days I find this to be way too sweet though. Other days the peat realty shines through
Well said
Yeah that's fair. Definitely try experimenting yourself! I imagine you can come up with a comparable home blend
I've been meaning to try that but I don't want to pull the trigger on a whole bottle
The Infinity line uses scotch? Or peated scotch at that? Interesting. I've actually stayed away from the Barrell Infinity bottles as I don't know what batch is what and I've never really been a fan of Infinitys in general with friends doing so. And I read mixed reviews on the Infinity line. But may have to give it a try.
Yes, although it's never really hinted which Scotch they do use. I know there's a peated Scotch because their Tale of Two Islands Rum has a peated Scotch in the background. Chances are high it's a Diageo brand though because Barrell sources lots of Diageo stuff from George Dickel to Bulleit to Crown distillate. Which Diageo owned Scotch is peated?
No clue lol. Edit - Just checked and wow, they own a shitload of whiskey brands including Clynelish which I did not know. Off hand peated, looks like they own Lagavulin, Caol Ila, Talisaker, Johnny etc

Guess I never realized how large Diego is, good lord. They own a shitload of companies across all markets."
"Reviews #120/121, Glendronach 12 & 18",,https://i.redd.it/a6ndud927g941.jpg,"**Glendronach 12 ""Original,"" 43%**

**Nose:** Honey, light sweet sherry, warm orange, chocolate, vanilla

**Taste:** Caramel and malt, delicate fruity wine, rich stewed fruits, raisins, smooth warm orange, mild spice

**Finish:** Gentle spice, light caramel, sweet fruits. A lightly sweet and pleasant finish.

* Lots of easy-going sweet sherry with no sulfur or bitter fruits, and plenty of malt presence which I really like. Just pleasant all around. It has a great mouthfeel for the low ABV, I always felt a decently priced 43% like this is a good compromise between ""fuck you 40%"" and the higher price of a 46%. An excellent starter Scotch or introduction to sherry.

Score: **6/10**

*****

**Glendronach 18 ""Allardice,"" bottled 2017 (possibly making this 22 years old) 46%**

**Color:** I don't usually mention color but holy shit this stuff is insanely dark for a naturally colored Scotch, it's the one seen in the pic.

**Nose:** Intense syrupy-sweet cherry, deep brooding baking spices, tobacco, tons of grape sweetness, dark ripe fruits, rich chocolate, caramel, oak, menthol tingle. Incredibly complex nose, the different notes just keep coming

**Taste:** Arrives decadent, sweet, and rich right off the bat: Huge dark cherry syrup, velvety sweet sherry, oak, tobacco, grape wine sweetness, fudge, caramel, cherry cola, vanilla, stewed fruits with simmering spices. Complex flavors but they all get caught up in a single decadent, sticky-sweet freight train

**Finish:** Velvety smooth cherry and deep rich caramel with lots of mellow spice, some nice oak notes. Not super complex but it's so delicious. Sweet cherry and spice rides out a long time

* This is a ridiculously decadent and sweet Scotch, it's not your average sherry bomb. Absolutely none of the more challenging notes that can turn me off from sherry sometimes such as wine funk, sulphur, or tart bitter fruits. It's all just sweet syrupy goodness with some darker burnt oak. The ABV feels perfect, even at cask strength I might want to water it down to this. For being only 3% higher ABV it's just packed with flavor. The 12yr is a pleasant little malty romp through sweet sherry and honey, this is like drowning in sticky cherry syrup and huge wine richness.

Score: **8/10**

I usually rush past tasting notes but I thought yours were very well done for the 18 (I haven't had the 12). I agree that the best one word description is 'decadent'. It's a full-on sherry bomb but then it follows up with a crunchy, mouth filling burn that makes it drink like a higher ABV, but not as high as an Abunadh, which is a bit more savory in its finish. As good as it is, I have to be in the right mood to appreciate the Allardice; I haven't figured out that one thing (other than price) that gives me pause when I reach into the bin. Give me Abunadh or Signet any day of the week; oh well, always need a special occasion dram. Mine is a 2016 bottling, which I think makes it a 20 YO? I still haven't figured out the mothball numbers; I think I saw it posted elsewhere once.

My only gripe of your review - I was hoping for an equal, but opposite reaction/description of the joys of 46% ABV. You hit 40% on the nose! Cheers.
Wow. Crazy to see the color difference between the 2 bottles.
Have you tried mixing them together? I am curious as to what the rating would be if you mixed them and then let them sit for awhile and retried. Would it be a 7? A less strong 8? Still an 8 because the 18 has enough complexity to carry the 12?
I opened my bottle of the 18 (bottled 2018) and it had a ton of earth and tobacco, followed by sweet Sherry. Really enjoyable, but not the fruit bomb I was reading about. I'll be going back to it since I've only tried it that one time, but my first impressions were missing the syrupy fruit. Still loved it and was actually closer to what I wanted before purchasing the bottle (earth and tobacco notes).
It bothers me that the monkey isn't using a glass. He can't get a good smell from the bottle
I live my Allardyce. I want more but it's sold out in Australia!
Very nice, wish I could try this bottling. I liked my 2018 bottling much better than the 2019 bottling I have currently.
Back when this was bottled pre-shutdown at 40%, I actually found it a little more interesting and unique. It was still partially peated at that point, which helped it stand out from the pack. I agree, though, that the current edition is plenty tasty.
Thanks for reading, truly! Decadent felt like just the right word for this Scotch, I was patting myself on the back a bit I won't lie haha. I tend to rely heavily on adjectives when I try reviewing something. 

>I was hoping for an equal, but opposite reaction/description of the joys of 46% ABV.

How about ""I gotchu fam 46%?""

And here's a link to the Glendronach age table I often see: https://wordsofwhisky.com/glendronach-is-a-lot-older-than-the-label-says/
This is very interesting you say this. Lately I have also been hesitant to reach for the Allardice. I‚Äôm really in love with Signet, Glenfarclas 105 and Laphroaig 10 CS these days. I‚Äôve yet to try the A‚Äôbundah... it‚Äôs on my list for a few months now but heard recent batches the quality is hit or miss. What batch do you have?
Because it is not a 6 year difference, but more like 11 or 12.
That's actually a pretty interesting idea. Have you ever checked out r/WhiskeyFrankenstein?
I know exactly what you mean, only my initial response was disappointment with the bottle since I prefer these sweet and fruity. It opened up nicely though for me with some time. I find sherried scorch often needs more time to open up, although I usually find it to be more of a thing with CS sherry so I wasn't expecting it here. It's still heavy on the notes you mentioned, I think I called it burnt oak but earthy could work too, and I definitely got lots of tobacco as well. Its not a standard fruit bomb, it's much darker but maintains tons of sweetness still. It's an interesting one, I look forward to hearing your thoughts down the line.
Are you referring to the 18yr? It will be interesting to see side-by-side reviews of old/new 18yr bottlings in the future, after these go back to actually being 18 years old (if all the rumors are true).
I agree. I also had a 2018 and now a 2019, and while both are great, the 2018 was a notch above, for my taste. The chocolate note was huge, and the mouthfeel was punchier. The 2019 is a little more tame, and the dark chocolate is not as present.

That said it is still a great whisky, worth every penny I paid, and I'd dare say others may even prefer the 2019 bottling. I just had a different expectation after the 2018, and it was a bit different.
I don't know why, but I haven't tried Allardice head to head with Signet or Abunadh yet. I need to do that so maybe I can figure out what puts me off about it. I think it's one of three things u/buckydean pointed out:  (1) 'syrupy-sweet cherry', (2) 'tons of grape sweetness', (3) 'sticky-sweet freight train'. The color and nose are perfect and I think the palate is almost perfect. It all hits me in the finish, just something not right about it. I won't try TOO hard though because for a few dollars more, I'm into Signet territory again, where there are no disappointments. I would like to find the Glenfarclas 105.

Abunadh:  I have finished a #64 and have almost finished a #52. I have two more #52's unopened because the price was too good to pass up and I also have a #58 unopened. The 64 was slightly more warm and full compared to the 52, which is a bit more sharp on the palate. I don't notice much difference in flavor, but the sharpness of the older bottle gives it a bit less pleasant mouthfeel. This probably won't be an issue for most buyers as I doubt there are many batches below #60 on the shelf these days. I have found a #62 I plan to pick up at the next opportunity. I wouldn't be afraid of the 64, I posted my last notes on it versus my favorite Signet below.

&#x200B;

>Aberlour A'bunadh vs. Glenmorangie Signet: This is going to be short and to the point as neither of these disappoint. Signet is mature and very controlled on the nose, delivering all the sherry bomb and woody nuance you could want. A'bunadh has almost the same nose, replacing wood with cinnamon, but the higher ABV causes it to play fast and loose, so you have more nosing options if you want them. On standing, Signet is slightly sweeter on the nose as A'bunadh brings a savory background. Signet has chocolate, honey bun, cinammon bun, and a bit of tannic and salty finish that is slightly, but not overly dry, which in my mind is an extension of the control Signet has over itself. There's enough ABV from the nose to the finish to keep it interesting and a pleasing minty linger. Unbeatable, total package. A'bunadh has a power that won't be suitable for every palate, but it is the go-to dram for excitement. All the sherry bomb flavors are there with an added butterscotch, heat and kick that lingers a long time, which is what I enjoy before bed. However, there is a bit of a harsh aftertaste in the linger that I can't quite describe (maybe it's latex paint?) that might be a put-off to many palates. It doesn't bother me because I enjoy everything about A'bunadh, so much so that I already have a good supply of bottles, but it can't overcome the complexity and control of Signet, which remains the perfectly enjoyable dram in my opinion. It's possible that adding water to A'bunadh could tame and make it more competitive with Signet, but I'm not inclined to do that for the purposes of this tourney. It doesn't matter; I will always have both of these in rotation as I love them both.
I've had two A'bunadhs, the #54 and the #62. I like them well enough, but I don't know that I will replace the second bottle when it is gone. They are more on the ‚Äúorange zest‚Äù side of the sherry spectrum with a lot of heat and youth. Don't get me wrong, if the price was a little lower, it is probably something I would usually have on hand. 
The Allardice on the otherhand... I Love that bottle. Enough that I bought a backup of the 2018. 
Rich, dark and chocolatey. I think OP described it very well. 
All that being said, no, it isn't a bottle I reach for often. Partly because of the price, partly because once it's gone, it's gone, but also because of the ‚Äúfudge‚Äù factor. 
I really love fudge, but I couldn't eat it every day. The Allardice is a wonderful treat, from time to time. 

The Glenfarclas 105 is fantastic for the price. Half the price of the A'bunadh on a good day.   For me, it sits on a different end of the sherry spectrum. I get a lot of old leather from that one. 

I will have to try the Signet. That sounds pretty interesting
Not yet, I scare easily.
Yes the 18 YO. Agreed. With some time and I suppose oxidation I am liking my 18 even less now. 4-5 months ago when I just opened it, it was pretty good. On the other hand my Bunna 18 is still great and that has been open for almost a year now.
That is a great way to put it, the 2018 was absolutely more ‚Äúpunchier‚Äù. I actually had some Glendronach 24 the other week and honestly it was just a bit too tame and woody for me. The 2019 bottling of the 18 is also 24 years old so maybe I personally like them younger for Glendronach.
I've never quite understood this. Other distilleries have been mothballed and reopened, apparently without changing their age statements. Why does Glendronach have to decrease their age statements? And do we actually know if this is true or is it just BS that it's actually older whisky?
It‚Äôs def older whiskey as the Glendronach 12 has been actually 12 for few years now I believe and as of 2019 the 15 is 15. Reading the 15 reviews it seems that people much preferred the previous years much better."
"Review #119, Laphroaig Cairdeas 2019 TripleWood Cask Strength",,https://i.redd.it/gu88c11v13941.jpg,"This newest Cairdeas release is a cask strength version of the Triple Wood bottle, it's aged for an unspecified amount of time in standard ex-Bourbon barrels as well as quarter casks and oloroso sherry casks. 

*****

**Laphroaig Cairdeas 2019, Cask Strength Triple Wood, 59.5%**

**Nose:** Intense phenolic peat, vanilla, dark warm fruits, lots of heat and peppery spice, chocolate, more vanilla, brine, barrel char. A very dense nose that is mostly familiar Laphroaig notes with a dark and fruity undercurrent, not particularly ""wine-y"" which is fine. Delicious nose.

**Taste:** Darkly sweet arrival that pops with syrupy black cherry and tart fruitiness, melds smoothly into lumbering peat and sweet vanilla, burnt caramel, gritty barrel char, vanilla icing, sweet strawberry wine, a briny twang, peppery spice on the tail end. Like the nose it's lots of big flavors all very densely packed. It's not just a simple matter of sweet sherry flavors dancing around a peaty Scotch, it's more of a fruity and peaty beast with lots of sweet oak notes.

**Finish:** builds to bright vanilla, sweet cherry, barrel char, sweet oak, tons of intense phenolic peat. The peat and sweet vanilla lingers for a long time. A super bright, sweet, and peaty finish that is just delicious.

*****

This is my favorite Cairdeas in quite some time, and the first one in a while that I loved right off the bat. It's fun to be gung-ho about a Cairdeas release again. It's an awesome Laphroaig peat monster with sweet barrel notes and dark sweet fruitiness, so in that regard it seems to showcase the whole ""triple wood"" thing very well. And none of it overwhelms the peaty Laphroaig character, just makes it very delicious and interesting. The flavor is very densely packed, I suspect it will do well with some water but I haven't tried yet. 

I used to rank these but it's getting hard to do with how many releases there are and how much time has passed. I will say 2013, 2015, and 2019 would be my top 3 and are different enough from each other to be excellent in their own way. Here's some quick impressions:

* 2013 was epic

* 2014 was decent

* 2015 is my all-time favorite

* 2016 is my all-time worst, I struggled through the bottle

* 2017 was good but took a while to warm up to

* 2018 was excellent, took time to warm up to it (again)

I'll start by saying that I drink Islay scotch, virtually exclusively. I'm partial to Laphroaig, as that was the first Islay scotch I ever had. And that was in 1972, 48 years ago. I particularly like their Cairdeas releases. I fully agree with the statement: ""This is my favorite Cairdeas in quite some time, and the first one in a while that I loved right off the bat.""

I liked it so much that I got a box of it for my bunker. Guess I'll be drinking a lot of it. 2019, GOAT, so far, well, since the 2013 anyway. I hear that next years is going to be exceptionally special. 

For the record, the CS 011 is pretty high up there as well. Guess it was a good year for Laphroaig.

As for the Previous 6 vintages, I disagree with some of buckydean's preferences.

2018, The so-called FINO. Not fino to me. Hard to drink, and nothing redeeming about it.

2017, Very disappointing as well. Tasted like sawdust, more or less, with some peat thrown in to confuse you.

2016, Madiera cask. Wonderful. I bought a box of this too, after I tasted my first bottle. 

2015, even better than the Madiera cask version. Right up there with the best. In this I agree with buckydean.

2014, Amontillado. Also hard to drink. I bought two bottles, and was sorry. Still have the second, unopened, and it will probably stay that way. 

2013, Portwood. As others have said, including buckydean, ""epic""!

That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.
Still grumpy that the only local shop that had any in were holding them back for a bar, so I doubt I‚Äôll be able to get my hands on a bottle.
Great review, this is a good release. Ok, that said, I'll jump into the discussion of availability. I was just out in the Denver area and didn't see any Cairdeas 2019. It may be there but I didn't see any  while most of the Binny's stores in the Chicago area have shelves of it. This works out nice for me as I'm in the Chicago area but doesn't seem right that some areas have tons of it and other areas nothing. Spread the love, eh?  It must have to do with importing, or something, I don't know. Does anyone know the how and why ?
Nice review, great whisky, good photo, lovely monkey.
Wow, thanks for the comprehensive list. You like them sweet I take it, if you loved the Madeira so much. Ug I really hated that stuff lol. And I ended up liking the 2017/2018 even if it did take some warming up to, I like those gritty flavors and wood notes. Looks like we would have enough in common to share a dram though, so cheers old-timer!
How much does a box cost? How many bottles are in it?
Love your comments. I‚Äôm a huge Laphroaig fan too! Could you compare the 2019 Cairdeas with the CS 11? Also, if you had to choose between the two to take a case on an island which would it be? I am heading to a wedding in NJ in several weeks so plan to stock up on either from PA during the drive up. Hard to find either in the DC area for a reasonable price sadly.
Where do you live? I think there's plenty of it around in some places, maybe you can get some shipped? Here in cali it seems like you can usually still find the previous years release even when the new one comes out.
Might just not be as much demand in some places like Denver or Oregon, so stores dont order it, even if there are some people who want it. 

Do you go on WN much, did you see my message over there?
I think you covered it all, thanks!
Well, I had never thought about it as ""sweet,"" especially as I particularly like the Laphroaig Cask Strength 10's which aren't particularly sweet, in my opinion. But I do like Laga 16 and Ardbeg 10, which do have some sweetness to them. Hey, life gets shorter at my age, and I like to get relaxed at the end of the day with a pleasant experience. 

I once described the 2017 Cairdeas (the one in the gray/brown banded tubes) as having a nose like someone was sawing through a green-wood oak log, and the smell of the saw dust was rising into your nose. Not unpleasant, but I prefer the finishes of PX, Madeira, Port, or something in addition to Bourbon casks. I have scotch drinking friends who hate those types of finishes. Different strokes for different folks, I suppose. 

My biggest problem with sharing a dram is that I have a strict policy of not driving if I have had any alcohol within a 5 hour period. My liver and kidneys aren't working as well as they did 50 years ago, and I don't trust myself behind the wheel after a dram or two. Therefore I either have to do my drinking at home, or at my daughter's/son-in-law's house, where I can sleep over. They don't drink scotch, however. I have found that others my age feel the same way, so they generally don't come over here to sample a dram. Sometimes a fellow scotch drinker will sample a taste, but it's never a full dram, in my experience. This comes under the heading of: The time to do something is when you can!

I also really liked the Grooves and Drum from Ardbeg, but not the Kelpie. Do those characterize me as tending to prefer the sweeter expressioins?
Six bottles per case. Sometimes you get a break on the case price, sometimes not, really depends on the retailer.
In New Hampshire, there is no discount for a box (six bottles). But in Massachusetts I have purchased a box of scotch for between a 5 and 10 percent discount, depending on the charity of the store owner. So if a single bottle is $75, then a box is $450, or less depending on location. The box of 2016 Madiera cask Cairdeas that I bought cost me $330, which was $55 per bottle. The single bottle price at that time was $60. So, I got $30 off for buying a box, or you could look at it as getting a half bottle for free if you bought 5 1/2 bottles at the regular price. Hey, that's around 8 1/2 pours.
Seems to me that Calvert-Woodley, Potomac, or Central Liquor all had good prices for Laphroaig expressions, but perhaps they have all raised their prices from last year. The ten year old Cask strength Laphroaig is $72 in New Hampshire Liquor and Wine (this month only, going up to $75 in Feb), and the Cairdeas TW 2019 is $75. There is no tax in NH, so that's the price. Calvert-Woodley has the batch 011 for $80 per bottle. Not sure if this info helps, but just providing it for your comparison. From Exit 16 on the NJTP, it's only about a 4 hour drive up to the nearest NH Liquor and Wine store in Nashua, NH. If it's cheaper in PA, obviously go there instead. If you'd care to report back as to the PA price, it would be interesting to know.

If I were taking a box (of 6 bottles) to a desert island I would chose three bottles of each the 011 and the TW Cairdeas. Both are great in my opinion. The Cairdeas is 59.5% abv, and the CS 011 is 58.6% abv. So either way, you're getting a cask strength whisky. It's a toss up as to which is better. I'm leaning towards the Cairdeas TW, so perhaps 4 bottles of that and 2 bottles of the CS 011. Unless you're going to that island for a year, in which case I'd take a box of each. LOL. 

The big question is are they going to be drinking Laphroaig scotch at the wedding? If so, why so? It's not a commonly appreciated whisky, especially at weddings. 

I used to live in DC many years ago. I had a big store right on the north corner of Dupont circle, which, last time I was there was a Starbucks. Laphroaig used to cost $8 a bottle at Central Liquor, but that was in the early 80's.
Oregon. If it isn‚Äôt in the state system, we‚Äôre shit out of luck.
I suppose that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt go on WN  much but did just respond. Did you get it?
That's good you know your limits at least, better to play it safe. And I'm in a similar boat, I do very little whisky drinking with other people. I might bring a bottle to a party or pour some for a friend, but nobody I know is passionate about scotch or bourbon like I am. Kind of sucks, wish I could share drams with some of the people here such as yourself. 

The 2016 was the Madeira cask, and to me it was the most winey and syrupy sweet of the cairdeas releases, so I think that's in line with your preference for strong wine finishes. Doesn't mean that's all you like though. I definitely prefer the 2017 over the the 2016 but I like those charred and woody notes. It's all just personal preference in the end like you said.
That's super interesting, thanks for the reply!

I've never heard of anything like that here (in the UK) but it might be possible from smaller independent retailers. I guess the issue here is that they usually significantly mark up the price so even buying in bulk you still wouldn't be saving compared with purchasing individual bottles online.

I can definitely see the logic behind it though.
Thanks for your opinion! I‚Äôll pick up 2 of each. Looks like it would still be cheapest to pick up in PA since tax rate is 6%. Here is PA prices and inventory: https://www.finewineandgoodspirits.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/SearchResultsView?categoryId=&storeId=10051&catalogId=10051&langId=-1&sType=SimpleSearch&resultCatEntryType=2&showResultsPage=true&searchSource=Q&variety=&pageView=&beginIndex=0&pageSize=15&sortBy=5&searchTerm=Laphroaig&SearchKeyWord=Laphroaig#facet:&productBeginIndex:0&orderBy:&pageView:&minPrice:&maxPrice:&pageSize:&

Cool, had no idea those DC stores had the CS in stock. Too bad tax rate is 10.25% there. Good to know for future.

NE is such a beautiful place. My bucket list for a decade now was to to see the fall colors there which I finally did in fall of 2019. I was also able to score some 10 CS Batch 6, 7 and 10. Would love to get batch 11 and the TW Cairdeas and host a small tasting.

Oh very nice, did you used to own a liquor store? Also, no scotch for the wedding since it seems it will be a religious event. It will be for me :)
Oh yeah, it's a mixed blessing for you guys up there. You can find stuff other people have trouble with and everything is MSRP, but if it's not in the system it's nowhere in the whole state.
Yeah I got it, just wanted to throw that little suggestion out there. Don't worry I won't keep bugging you about it (ok I might a little)
In the days before there were cell phones and computers, the only way to talk/share with people was by land line phones, snail mail, or in person. They say that we've become more isolated as a society because of all the technology. When I was young, they used to say, ""never trust anyone over 30."" Today, anyone over 30 is basically from the age of before cell phones/computers. Perhaps it's always been this sort of division between the generations. 

As for limits, I used to be able to drive up to 1000 miles a day on my motorcycle. Now, having given up riding two wheels, I find it is difficult to drive 50 miles in my car. 

I once had a Bourbon at a colleague's apartment in NYC. He told me he had purchased a case of it at auction, for some obscene price. Something on the order of $80/bottle, and that was 40 years ago when a fifth of regular bourbon was in the $4-5 range in the liquor stores. I thought I remember him having said it had been barrel aged for 75 or 90 years, others have told me that this never happened. In any case, it was well aged. Although I still will drink bourbon from time to time, anything I can actually get pales in comparison to the dram that spoiled me forever. I find with scotch, on other hand, there are still many great bottles to be found at a reasonable price. I also used to be an aficianado of bordeaux wine. But it just got to be too damn expensive, considering that a great bottle of bordeaux is going to cost you several hundreds of dollars, and there's only 5 glasses per bottle. Never mind that you have to keep it properly stored at 55-60 degrees for years before you can actually drink it. No thanks. Too much like work. I'll stick to scotch. 

But if you're in southern New Hampshire sometime, message me in advance, we'll arrange for a sharing of pours.
Of course the big retailers and supermarkets don't give discounts beyond what they key into their checkout computers and published sales, which apply to single bottles. Same here. You have to go to a store which only has a few locations, or perhaps a single location, and ask for the box discount. One time I wanted to buy a box of something at a store that was about an hour away from me, and to which I didn't go that often (once a year). They only had three bottles in stock, so I just asked the manager if he could give me the ""box"" price for the three bottles anyway, seeing as how they didn't have any more in stock. And he did. Moral of the story: You don't ask, you don't get.

Knowing that they typically make a big markup (and I don't know what you mean by ""big,"" but I'd say anything over 100% would be more than a normal retail markup), should give you some extra bargaining room. For example, if you're prepared to buy a box, you could approach the manager and ask for a 15% discount, hoping to settle on 7.5% off the per bottle price. If they come back at 10% off, I'd consider that to be a score. It's expensive to run a retail shop, and the mark up does not represent the net profit by a long shot. Anything over 5% would be a bonus, but for less than 3%, I think I'd rather buy single bottles. Which you can use as leverage to bargain for something closer to 5%.

Some people drink two bottles or more a month, so that's 4 boxes a year. I typically drink  bottle a month, so that's two boxes a year. Therefore I'm getting pretty picky about what I decide to buy a box of these days. Even with the proposed 100% tariff on scotch that the yellow haired clown in the white house thinks he's going to push through, my scotch bunker is still good for a year and a half. After that, I'll probably switch over to Bourbon until they lift whatever tariff they might impose.
I am astonished. The tax rate in DC is up to 10.25% now? Here in New Hampshire we have no sales tax, and no income tax. I guess I'm just spoiled. As for paying 6% in PA with the prices about $3-$5 higher to begin with, I'm glad I'm here, and not there. You would probably have to buy three boxes in NH to make the 8 hour round trip drive from NJ worth your while. The CS 011 is still in stock here, but I'm not altogether sure about whether there's any Cairdeas TW  left in the state. 
BTW, every year we get to see the fall colors, and we don't have to drive anywhere. It normally peaks around October 12th, but this year is was late, and sort of drawn out. The colors were about a 7 on a scale of 1-10, but didn't all happen at once. When it's a banner year, and the colors are spectacular, and they all come out in the same week, that's something worth seeing. But it's sort of like wine. You never know if it will be good until after the time has passed to buy it.
P.S. I'd skip the Fino and the QC Cairdeas. Just not worth the price of admission. Ardbeg 10 or Laphroaig 10 are both better drinkers.
That‚Äôs the situation in a nutshell. There also used to be some great FOAFing opportunities, but those have mostly disappeared as the OLCC became more aggressive about putting shelf turds on closeout to rotate stock.
Ha, that‚Äôs cool
Funny, my birthday is the 12th! I went to NH and VT for most of the week and it was breathtaking. Blows Skyline drive out of the water! 

NH def had some great prices. What made you move up there from DC? Are you happier there now? I could see my self possibly retiring up there. I grew up in Canada so feel at home with the cold.
Well dont give up yet, I've seen stores that keep restocking this well into the following year.
The early 20th century comedian, W.C. Fields, once said: The coldest winter I ever spent was July in San Francisco. I found that the winter weather in DC and NYC was not as pleasant as the weather in NH. It may be colder here, by about 10 degrees on average, but the temperature isn't the whole story. It's that damp wet/cold wind that goes into your bones in DC that was so uncomfortable, while in NH it's mostly a dry cold. I swear, 15 degrees F in NH is more comfortable than 25 degrees in DC. But the worst part in DC is the 7 month stretch where you have to keep your air conditioner on 24/7 (April to October), and the night time temps in July don't drop below 90. In NH we rarely have to turn on the a/c more that two or three weeks a year. I found the heat to be so miserable that I was depressed all the time. Never mind the god awful traffic, crime, parking problems, high cost of living, and pollution. Nuff said?

Am I happier here? I feel like I picked the best place in the US to retire. And I went to see 38 different states just to be sure I was making the right decision."
"Review #124, WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel South Lyndale Liquors 58%",,https://i.redd.it/0zuymirjv0941.jpg,"**WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel, South Lyndale Liquors, 58%**

**Nose:** Dark and reserved nose. Mocha and rich sticky toffee, undercurrent of strong minty Rye, tobacco, charred barrel, cocao, mellow spice.

**Taste:** Huge sweet minty Rye takes over cool and steady, big vanilla, dill, mocha, chocolatey barrel notes, rich dark caramel, toasted barrel char, sweet oak, peppery spice.

**Finish:** Rye builds bigger, brighter, and spicier with sweet vanilla and chocolate, leaves minty with nice peppery spice. Exactly the kind of big Rye finish I look for in these.

*****

This one is heavy on darker sweet oak notes that can easily take over and overwhelm a Whiskey, but here it strikes a very nice balance with a huge cool Rye presence. And it achieves it without any off-putting tannic or bitter wood notes. I'm amazed at how excellent and skillfully aged bottles like this taste, for being seemingly random single barrels that pop up all over the place. I've had enough to say it's not blind luck, the good barrels vastly outnumber the very few duds I've had. I'm not familiar with any of South Lyndale's other picks, but I'd be interested in trying more stuff from them.

France44 had (or maybe still has) two WP10 barrel picks - one spicy and one cherry flavored. It was super interesting to taste them side by side because the flavor profile was completely different. Both were good; the cherry pick is one of the best ryes I‚Äôve had.
Okay, total noob question here. What‚Äôs the difference between the regular and the store pick? I‚Äôve had trouble explaining, although I‚Äôve heard the store pick is ‚Äútechnically‚Äù a 13 year. Help!
Man saw a store pick of this at total wine and ended up passing. Still kicking myself over it!
[deleted]
[deleted]
A spicy pig.
Yep. I got a single barrel pick from my local honey hole. Outstanding juice.
This is $86 around me. Is it worth that?
As a huge fan of WP this sounds great. I want
Yeah I got one of each of those France44 picks, I've only opened one so far but I really liked it. Side by sides are really fun and educational, it can really tune you in to different notes that might not jump out at you otherwise. K&L released three 13 year barrels last year with the same distillation date, that was lots of fun to do side by side too.

I reviewed one of those France44's, not sure which one. Tasting notes can be pretty subjective, but funnily enough I go on about cherries quite a bit here so I wonder if it's the same one. https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/ar4i5i/review_64_whistlepig_10yr_single_barrel_france44/
The store picks are single barrels that someone at the store selected from a lineup of several barrels, the idea is that someone vouched for this barrel and liked it enough to sell at their store. The standard WhistlePig 10yr bottling is blended and vatted from many barrels to achieve a consistent flavor profile. The single barrel store selects are always bottled at full barrel proof, while the standard 10yr is watered down to 50%. Some of these single barrels are older than 10 years, it's not uncommon to find ones that are 13 years but that doesn't mean they all are. You're pretty much just going off the word of the store who selected it since WhistlePig doesn't reveal anything. A lot of stores just select a barrel and never find out more info on it from WhistlePig, so they have no idea. Some stores want the info so they can proudly tell their customers the age, it just varies from store to store. All you know for sure is that they are *at least* 10 years old.
A store pick means the store personally picked a barrel of that type of bourbon. It‚Äôs usually only available at that location. Many liquor stores and bourbon clubs do this. So it‚Äôs basically a single barrel that they decided they liked the best.
These aren't rare, and from what I've seen TotalWine seems to always have a pick in stock so I think you're ok. Only problem is the price is creeping up, I see these for $100+ a lot now, and it tends to be the smaller stores that still have them for $80-$90
Honestly the age isn't too important with these, 13 years is cool and all but 10 is still a very respectable age for a barrel proof rye. They just tend to be really good no matter what, if you're into the strong Rye profile.

EDIt: your/you're
Also fyi, you've been replying to the post in each one of your comments, you should just be hitting ""reply"" to the comment that you're actually replying to.
Correct. Flavor and character is gonna vary from barrel to barrel.
I usually see them for $80-$90 so the price is normal. It's one of the best Whiskies readily available imo, but I hope you like a really strong 100% rye. Some people don't care for the strong rye flavors of stuff like this, but that's just personal preference.
It is one of the better WP's I've had in a while, but the bar is so high for these that it wasn't some unicorn bottle or anything. I will say I checked south lyndales website before posting this to see if they had anymore lol.
Interesting, thanks for linking that!  No it‚Äôs not the same pick. I have a bottle and it literally has ‚Äúcherries‚Äù in the pick name which came out this fall. For the one I am taking about I don‚Äôt recall mint; more of a cherry, wood and spices.
Hey - are you from the Twin Cities? I've always enjoyed your reviews. Fellow Twin Cities (west suburbs) here.

Curious about you too u/duanetodd?

Cheers either way fellas! ü•É
I have a store pick of the 10 year single barrel that they said was actually 13 years. It was slightly darker than the standard 10 year that they had so I believe them
I‚Äôm in northern nj and only seen a WP store pick once in the last 6 months
Oh I gotcha lol, an easy mix-up. It sounds like whoever does the picks there might just really go for cherry flavors in these.
Thank you for the kind words, I enjoy writing them so it's good someone enjoys reading them too haha. 

I'm not from the area sorry, I've lived in California my whole life. Otherwise I'd say we should grab a beer! I visited Minneapolis last year and you guys have so many great stores there it turned into an all-out Whiskey hunt for local barrel picks. I posted my goodies here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Whiskyporn/comments/ahzc5i/just_visited_minneapolis_im_impressed_with_the/
I am in the Twin Cities yup
Sorry, yeah it will be regional obviously. Hopefully TW might still have it next time you go, in my experience way over here in California they always have them in stock.
Probably so, and I am okay with that."
"Review #118, Wardhead 22 r/scotch single cask",,https://i.redd.it/y18bu7dx0w841.jpg,"A barrel personally selected by some fine folks here at r/Scotch. This is ""teaspooned"" Glenfiddich, meaning they took a barrel of Glenfiddich and added a tiny amount of some other Scotch(possibly Balvenie from what I've read) so that it could no longer be called a Glenfiddich single malt. TBH it's not a process that I fully understand, and the result is technically a ""blended malt.""

*****

**Wardhead (teaspooned Glenfiddich) 1997 22yr blended malt, single cask for r/Scotch, refill hogshead, 54.7%**

**Nose:** Delicate sweet malty nose. Honey, rich waxy malt, sticky-sweet caramel, smooth floral notes, banana, light vanilla, delicate pastry, spice. Over time richer caramel and musty oak notes emerge.

**Taste:** Richer than the delicate nose but very even and balanced, still not an assault. Rich honey and sticky-sweet caramel, waxy malt, lemon, green apple, sweet vanilla, nice floral notes, bitter oak, all balanced with a beautiful and smooth malty backbone

**Finish:** Long sweet finish. Builds bright with lemon, sweet vanilla, oak spice, rich caramel and malt. It lingers sweet and malty for a long time.

*****

A beautiful example of a well-aged Scotch. Rich malt, delicate sweeter notes, and smooth wood influence all balanced together perfectly in a way you get with age. I actually wasn't crazy about it when I first opened it, it was kind of muted and too delicate, but richer flavors have opened up nicely over time. Now it's a great Scotch to sit and take your time with, it opens up slowly with rich and complex notes emerging. I don't usually get to personally thank people for a good barrel selection, so lemme take this chance to say thanks to our r/Scotch team: Thanks my dudes!

Nice review. I personally got a lot of apple cider from this, but I may just be sensitive to that. It's a very nice scotch and pretty unique in flavor in my opinion. Can't really find a Glenfiddich that isn't covered in Sherry or watered down.
Great review! It‚Äôs so great to see people enjoying these!!
Nice review! Did you try the Ardmore, too?
I often get green apple from malt scotches, but yeah didn't turn up here for me I guess. Agreed, it's a nice expression from fiddich. Its not a very robust malt which makes sense why you wouldn't see it like this a lot, this barrel aged very well.
Thanks! I had a question about the selection process if you dont mind, and I'll pose it to you as well as u/t8ke and anyone else on the team. 

I've had so many barrel Selects like this one that I wasn't crazy about when I first popped the cork, and really needed some time to open up. I have found it to be especially true with some BP sherried Scotches and Four Roses. How do you account for this when selecting based on a sample? Is it all in my head? Do you actively try to imagine how well the flavor will open up over time? Has your bottle changed much compared to that first sample you tried? I've always wondered about this aspect of a barrel selection
No, I just happened to have a 12yr Ardmore from Exclusive Malts open already, didn't want to open another Ardmore yet. I bought one though, I'll get to it someday
It‚Äôs really difficult - the best metric we have is to taste a week or days apart each sample from the set to see how air/water change things, but there is no good way to estimate how things will open up. 

Statistically speaking, we have a slight advantage in respect that most things *generally* are perceived to be better over long periods of time with relatively few being perceived as worse, but we aren‚Äôt afforded months and entire bottles to confirm this. 

That was a lot of words to say that we don‚Äôt super consider how things may open up, we go instead with what is best sampling and are generally well cared for by statistics and perception.

My bottle is pretty similar, but has opened up to be a hair fruitier, which i‚Äôm in love with
That's kind of what I figured. Theres only so much you can plan for, just gotta go with your gut and like what you like when you try it.
Yeah, I can only repeat u/t8ke here. Most whisky will open up over time but particular distilleries or older whiskies seem to improve a lot. I try to leave the whisky to open up while I‚Äôm tasting it, likely for longer than I normally would and try it a few times over a few days.
Yeah letting it sit for longer than usual would be a decent strategy. Thanks for the response. It just blows my mind how much this bottle changed for me after being open for a month. I would not have picked it based on my first sip, but now I love it and totally get it. Maybe you guys just have a keener sense than me and are better at seeing the quality of a barrel, I need some warm up time apparently lol. Thanks for the reply"
"Review #16, Amrut Peated Cask Strength batch 30, 62.8%",,https://i.redd.it/ihkntw8p8u841.jpg,"This was the oldest sample in my collection, I got it from u/MonsieurZaccone 3 years ago.

*****

**Amrut Peated Cask Strength Batch #30, 62.8%**

**Nose:** This nose is a down and dirty peat bomb through and through. Intense yet clean smoke, gritty barrel char, rich shiny caramel, band-aids, vanilla. Reminds me of a really good Laphroaig

**Taste:** Wow, so much incredible flavor! Explosion of dense medicinal peat with vanilla, caramel, amazing and vibrant fruitiness, sweet cake icing, deep toasted barrel notes. It's incredibly vibrant and alive, packed full of flavor, not just a ""hot burn"" at 62.8%.

**Finish:** Nice mix of sweetness and gritty char, with tons of peat. Huge lumbering peaty finish with clean vanilla and sweet charred barrel notes, peppery spice. It's huge and incredibly clean & focused, not an off note to be found. It lingers, charred and peaty for ages. 

*****

Holy shit this is amazing. It uses every last bit of the high 62% ABV to deliver tons of intense and vibrant flavor, it feels like nothing is going to waste here. These guys should be extremely proud of what they accomplished. It's not just an Islay-style Scotch, it easily competes with anything coming off that island. And not in an experimental Kilchoman/Port Charlotte kind of way, it's a proper mean peat monster in the vein of Laphroaig, Lagavulin 12, and CS Caol Ila. Sorry if I'm late to the party and stating the obvious(this is batch #30 after all), but it's new to me and just wow.

Where do you get such small bottles of whisky?
Glad you liked this so much, and that the sample held up all that time! This was a very complex whisky for me and I remember not liking it initially but towards the end of the bottle really enjoying what it evolved into. I'll have to dig up my notes since it seems I never posted my review. Cheers!
Cool, brilliant review by the way
Great review. So was this a Blackadder bottling? https://www.binnys.com/blackadder-amrut-peated-cask-finished-indian-single-malt-959908.html
[deleted]
Yes!  I absolutely love this-- one of my fastest bottle kills and I do not think I shared it with anyone.  So much great stuff going on in some of the peated Amruts.
I'm in a whiskey group that trades samples like these with each other
How do you feel about peated scotch in general? I love peat, I can't imagine a fan of fierce islay peat not liking this. Glad you and/or the bottle came around though!
I'm pretty sure it's this distillery bottling, the abv matches up anyway. That one looks interesting though. I'm confused, is it peated or just finished in a peated cask?
You aint lying haha. A beautiful cask strength malt Whisky peat bomb
I've had some good experience with Amrut, but nothing that prepared me for a peated Scotch this good. I had no idea
Yup, I think you‚Äôre right. The Blackadder does look interesting and not sure about the level of peatedness. Will look into it"

**Nose:** Musty sour wood, chocolatey toasted oak, sweet vanilla, orange zest, settles into some mildly ""zingy"" hot cherry and mint

**Taste:** Sweet caramel, cherry syrup, sweet corn, light vanilla, tannic oak, chocolate, light toasted barrel char, mild mintiness. Sweet and woody

**Finish:** Chocolate cherry and smooth vanilla, leaves with some lingering sweetness, mild char and tingly spice. Short-ish but complex and super tasty.

*****

I've said this before, but Wild Turkey tends to have this effortless quality where it tastes delicious without trying too hard. It's always just well-aged quintessential Bourbon goodness. And K&L picks some really good ones. This isn't one of my favorite picks, it has some odd sour or stale notes that pop up(just barely), but it's not nearly enough to ruin it and overall it flows into some real nice flavor and remains delicious.

Great review!

I like the monkey poster
I picked up a store pick bottle of this yesterday from Cypress Craft Beer in Orange County.  I only drank a little bit but it was delicious
Great review, can't go wrong with a Russell's Reserve pick
I bought a bottle for $59.99 at a random liquor store. So was not a store pick. But everything seems to be crazy expensive in my area. EH Taylor Small Batch $80, Blanton‚Äôs $90...I don‚Äôt even bother looking for the really allocated stuff anymore. When I find it I‚Äôm just disappointed
I‚Äôd say store picks average between 55-65. The non store picks can sometimes be found for less.
Ooh nice. 100% agree. Can always count on this to taste delicious.
Username checks out, and thanks!
I've only ever had 1 bad Russel's Reserve pick, and it was from some midwestern Grocery store chain or something. I think someone commented that the store has done other bad picks as well."

*****

**Pappy Van Winkle Family Reserve 15yr, 2016 release, 107/53.5%**

**Nose:** Brown Sugar and toasted oak, sweet vanilla, mellow spice, cherry, mint, butterscotch, cinnamon, a delicious nose that balances between mellow oak and sweet Bourbon notes beautifully.

**Taste:** Sweet cherry, spice, smooth caramel. A nice minty mouthfeel, sweet toasted oak, hot cinnamon tingle. It's delicious and complex but in a very refined and cohesive way, it doesn't jump out of the glass and smack you in the face with flavor.

**Finish:** Slowly transitions into mellow charred oak notes with lots of mint and cinnamon before building to bright sweet cherry and oaky spice.

*****

A beautiful Bourbon, but not quite what I was expecting. Honestly with all the hoopla and craziness surrounding this bottle I'm not even sure what I was expecting lol. For the proof and age it doesn't have real huge or dramatic flavors, but on the other hand it's not overly ""smooth"" and boring like mass-appeal stuff tends to be. It's also far from being an oak bomb at 15 years. It balances very mature and smooth oak notes with complex spice and delicious sweet wheat flavors, and it does it all in a very refined and elegant way. It's certainly not the end-all of Bourbon, I feel like I've had Four Roses and Russel's Reserves that I easily enjoyed as much or more. It's a delicious and well-crafted Bourbon for sure, I wish I could go buy a bottle at a normal price without all the bullshit. But it's not worth crazy secondary prices and I don't feel any profound sense of loss knowing I pry won't ever own a bottle.

Celebrated New Year's last year drinking Pappy 15. Had a very generous friend (who has since passed away) give a sample. Cheers to life and a good year.
Is it similar to anything else you‚Äôve tried?
Really glad to see a more unbiased opinion on the dram. Never hunted a buffalo trace product.. never plan too.. might try it if it's at a bar I go to, and probably buy a BTAC collection item at MSRP if I saw it. But with so many great other drinks on the shelf I love, that literally just take up space all the time, I got no reason to search or pay secondary. Great review!
These turned south a bit after 2012. I reviewed a 2013 on here and it was really medicinal/acetone freshly popped and though that dissipated over time it never really got clear of it. I think by ‚Äò16 they were improving. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve tasted one since. Thanks for the review and glad you got to try it.
Yup, I had some a few days ago for the first time and that was my reaction as well.
Cheers to life indeed, I'm sorry about your friend.
It's hard to say, it doesn't really have the creamy sweetness I was expecting like Weller and other Wheated Bourbons I've had, but that might just be the age on it. I think the age is what gives this a lot of very cohesive and balanced flavor that's hard to find in other Bourbons.
Thanks for reading! I'm the same way, I just ignore the whole Pappy/BTAC thing and stick to all the good stuff I actually can get. I lucked into this sample, that's the only reason I'm even trying it since I won't pay bar prices either lol.
I'm not one to get caught up in hype, but I am a big fan of Wheated Bourbon so I was really looking forward to this sample. And honestly, it didn't knock my socks off even being biased towards liking it. I'm having some ""next morning clarity"" and wondering if I might have been a tad generous on the score, a 7 might have been more fitting-still really good, but I was searching.

The best WHEATER I've ever had to date is still an OWA store pick from K&L. I think even ORVW 10yr beat this out for me, but that was years ago so it's hard to say. Thanks for reading!
Even when a Whiskey is fantastic it's hard to live up to the level of hype and insanity built up around them.
It's always a true loss when a genuine and generous person is gone. I delivered some Heaven Hill 6 year to his son, as it was one of the drinks his dad always enjoyed. Maybe we all can do a little good in 2020.
Yeah, not even sure I would pay for bar prices.. I can get 2-3 good drams for the price of what? One pappy? Hard pass.

Edit: Wanted to add, always love reading your reviews
Indeed
Right? when you're choosing a measly 1 or 1.5oz pour over multiple bottles, that's an easy pass lol. I don't like bars anyway, so it's not like I'm resisting temptation a lot. And then if you have to tip a percentage, that's what a $20 tip on one pour? Like that bottle is harder to pour than any other bottle? GTFO with that.

Anyway rant over, and thanks dude. It's always fun writing them too."
"Review #121, Rittenhouse Rye",,https://i.redd.it/gdkxu15ugv741.jpg,"At the price point, I can‚Äôt think of a better entry level rye
**Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond, 50%**

**Nose:** Sweet vanilla, pastry, clean toasted wood, light herbal Rye, smooth mint, cherry sweetness, heavy wood must. A nice smoothly toasted nose, Rye is more in the background.

**Taste:** It's hot and action-packed, a bit of a mess but there's some nice flavor and it's certainly not boring. Herbal Rye spice and caramel, sweet vanilla, cinnamon, corn spirit, astringent, hot cherry, oak spice. It benefits from air in a way cheaper bottles usually don't.

**Finish:** strong oak, hot cherry, lots of hot spice.

*****

The nose is the best part here, and the only part that I found completely enjoyable. Not enough Rye flavor for my taste, and it's overly astringent and a bit of a mess. It's decent for a budget bottle luckily so I can't really fault it as if they were charging a premium. If I had to drink cheap I would probably prefer Bulleit Rye, but would circle back around to this when that started feeling too thin or boring.

I don‚Äôt hate it, bounce back n forth between this and OF Rye...
Brown Forman made it better
This is one of my go to picks for an old fashioned, not outstanding neat but great with bitters and simple syrup
IMO, Rye isn't a straight drink. It's perfect in cocktail (ie: old fashioned) as it spices up that drink. Every Rye I've tried neat, is too much. To each their own of course.

Edit: btw, I love how people downvote opinions on reddit. For real, get a fucking life.
This or OF signature rye
Like I said I personally prefer bulleit, I like the strong rye character over a more bourbony flavor like this. The higher abv is nice on this though.
How would you compare to overholt
Accurate review. The DSP354 versions of this were better. HH rye seems to benefit from some age. Pikesville is a definite step up. The PHC from this year was really good (but not $160 good).
OF Rye BIB was decent, but as a Rye I hate it. It just tastes like a Bourbon. When I drink rye I want a really strong and spicy rye character.
Yeah it seems like kind of a consensus that this stuff works well as a mixer. I'd pry enjoy it more as a mixer than straight
I've been enjoying this with Demerara (sp?) syrup and bitters. It's very nice.
Yeah to each their own, because I strongly disagree lol. I crave strong 100% rye mashbill like MGP(95%) and WhistlePig, the thing I cant stand is a barely legal Bourbony rye. This does seem like it work well as a mixer though.
Yeah OF is a little more delicious at slightly cheaper in my book.  Rittenhouse is better for specific cocktails, however (OF better for others).  A good home bar will have both!
I also wonder if the better casks are being held back to go into Pikesville now.
I always get a painful little pang whenever the DSP354 comes up. Back in my earlier Whiskey days I found a bottle in a little store by a relatives house, but I passed it up because I hadn't cared for the regular stuff when I tried it. I noticed it was a different label but didn't give it much thought until I learned more later.
I agree, I really like the 95%MGP rye as well. But as a mixer. I've tried it a few times neat, and...nope.
Could just be a grumpy guy take. But I did a side by side long ago that should be archived."
"Review #120, The Senator Barrel Proof Rye (MGP) 6yr, fall 2018 60.7%",,https://i.redd.it/q7ncl4mkxm741.jpg,"Sample courtesy of u/Chardogg

*****

**The Senator Barrel Proof Rye Whiskey (MGP) 6yr, fall 2018, 121.4/60.7%**

**Nose:** Oaky and rich. Big toasted oak, chocolate, tobacco, cool mellow Rye spice, mild dill, minty undercurrent underneath the big tannic oak, burnt caramel, slight char.

**Taste:** Big flavor but it's dark, oaky, and a bit even-keeled. Tannic oak, tobacco, cool and mellow minty Rye undercurrent, chocolate, dark cherry cough syrup sweetness, vanilla.

**Finish:** The bright Rye that I really crave from MGP finally comes through. Bright and zingy Rye spice explodes with strong oak and cherry cough syrup, but it lingers with nice cherry sweetness and mellow rye tingle. 

*****

I'm a huge fan of MGP Rye and as such I might be overly picky about it. Bottom line it's a delicious Rye and I will be buying a bottle now that I've tried it. It falls a little short of my personal tastes and (high) expectations for the Indiana distillery, but I just came off a review of two amazing SAOS single barrels so my judgement might be a little clouded. I got excited about a 6yr barrel proof MGP Rye which is right in my 5-8 year sweet spot for the stuff, but a SAOS or Willet single barrel this is not. I'm a Rye fiend and I'll take that sweet barrel proof 95% juice however I can get it, so it's still a winner in my book but I wish someone could recapture that old MGP Rye magic I initially fell in love with.

New to this sub so this may be a dumb question: what's with the small vials/jars I see people posting instead of full bottles?
Enjoyed the review. I've got a bottle of Redemption 10 BP Rye that is fantastic. Have you tried that one?
I wonder how much different the different proofs of these are. We definitely had different experiences with them. That said I see what you mean by the darker flavors vs the bright rye

Great review! I‚Äôve been sitting on a bottle of this for a while and this has me looking forward to opening it up once I‚Äôm close to finishing off another MGP rye, likely the Rossville BP. 

Been loving the various MGP rye reviews the last few days :)
No problem. Some of us are in a Whiskey group that trades these samples with each other.
Some of these nibbas is broke as hell and can't afford a bottle.
Thanks for reading. Yeah I really liked that one, more than this bottle. I bought a backup of that one, I don't think I will for the Senator. It's still a bit oakier than I prefer for MGP, I just really love the more bright Ryes from them. I reviewed it here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/8lzgh8/review_48_redemption_rye_10yr_barrel_proof/
Are you referring to the different Senator release? Which one have you tried? This is the only one I've had, but there was a review posted yesterday for a 2019 bottling. I'll pry buy the other release if I see one, now that it's on my radar. 

>I see what you mean by the darker flavors vs the bright rye

I'm kind of a Rye fiend and I really love MGP, but I almost feel like I'm chasing the dragon at this point with my hunt for those ""brighter"" MGP's. Maybe it's just hard to recreate the magic of those Willett and SAOS single barrels in these batched products, or maybe I'm just too picky lol. WhistlePig single barrels have actually been scratching that 100% Rye itch luckily, but I still really enjoy these barrel proof MGP releases.
Thanks for reading, I remember you're a big fan of MGP Rye too. I was hoping I didn't make it sound like I didn't like this stuff, because it's a solid Rye.

Hows the Rossville?
Whaaaaat?! That's cool as fuck.
That‚Äôs so cool. How do you get into a group like this?
Yes, I am the person who posted that review
There used to be a subreddit dedicated to it called r/Scotchswap, but Reddit banned it. A lot of people(myself included) still have samples sitting around from back then, so sometimes that is what you're seeing too

**Taste:** Super spicy, god I love how quintessentially ""Rye"" this stuff is. Explosion of minty Rye spice and dill with rich toffee and bold toasted oak, it has huge flavor but is very sharp and cutting at the same time. Mint, wood, spice, Rye and more Rye.

**(2) Smooth Ambler Old Scout Rye single barrel (MGP), 8yr Spirits Shoppe pick, 61%**

**Nose:** Sharp bright Rye spice and sticky-sweet maple, green apple, herbal spice, wood must, toasted oak. Rich and bold Rye but a little more funky and fruity compared to #1

**Taste:** Sweet caramel and strong minty Rye, green apple, bright fruity sweetness. There's some rich toffee and clean toasted wood but overall it remains very bright and sharp. Very complex flavors.

**Finish:** Excellent finish of rye spice, sweet caramel and oak, and mouth-numbing menthol. A complex finish that lingers for ages

*****

Great MGP Rye like this always makes me feel so alive, it is so action-packed and lively on the tongue and it just explodes with flavor. The Rye spice punches you in the face and compliments the richer oak flavors beautifully. I feel like the 5-8 year range is perfect, before it gets too bogged down and oaky but still retains it's youthful vibrancy. (2) is the more sweet and bright of the two, and (1) is richer and oakier. Both are incredibly complex and delicious in their own way. Usually I would tend toward the brighter and more lively action of (2), but (1) just has this huge ""presence"" that can't be denied. These are both fantastic without a doubt though.

Glad you enjoyed! That Bounty Hunter was one of the early 7 year releases and is one of my favorite old SAOS bottles I've had.
Great reviews. I really enjoyed the sense of excitement you conveyed in the tasting notes! They Bounty Hunter pick sounds amazing
What are your thoughts on HW Double Rye? I get a lot of the same flavors coming through on that one like you described here, which makes sense. Curious how you think they compare?
I have the Bounty Hunter pick. Don't know if I like it quite as much as you do, but definitely some quality stuff!
Yeah it's pretty fucking amazing, I hope these levels of excellence from MGP can be available again someday.
Thanks for reading! I can't help it, I just get excited with good MGP Rye haha
Double Rye is really good stuff, it was one of my first Ryes I enjoyed. It uses 2 different Ryes(hence the name), one of which is the same MGP juice as this stuff only much younger. There's a lot of similar notes like this that can come through in different MGP Ryes.

That being said, These are well-aged single barrels personally selected by enthusiasts at great stores and bottled at full proof, they are in a completely different league compared to a standard bottling like Double Rye.
As one should!"

**""Fragile"" sample #4: Jean-Luc Pasquet Lot 73, Cognac Petite Champagne, 50.3% (done blind)**

**Nose:** I'm gonna go with Brandy on this one based on the nose so far. It's a delicate and pleasant nose of soft fruity sweetness, mild chocolate, dark cherry, menthol, wood

**Taste:** Grape sweetness and soft warm fruits, cherry, delicious spice, sweet vanilla, smooth oak, it's so pleasantly sweet like candy. This could even be a rum

**Finish:**Excellent finish, the spice builds huge with tons of cherry, vanilla, and sweet sugary goodness

*****

My mind said Brandy right off the bat but I might have been looking for it since I'm pretty sure it's not Whiskey and I know u/xreekinghavocx is an Armagnac fan. But the more I drank it the more I got rum vibes from it. But I still get a strong familiar grape kind of flavor too. I'm not super experienced with Brandy or Rum, so I could see it going either way.

**Post-Reveal Thoughts:** Phew, glad it wasn't some embarrassing reveal of Bourbon or something lol. My vague, inexperienced opinion about these Cognacs based on the 2 samples I had is that they seem more delicate and mild overall compared to Armagnacs. Very smooth and pleasant, but I think I prefer the bruisers and big bold flavors of Armagnac. This is delicious stuff though.

How much did it run you
Cognac is distilled more like malt whisky whereas armagnac is distilled more like bourbon. Along with their different cask choices, that tends to explain the similarities between the two pairs.
I only had a sample of it, I have no idea what a bottle costs sorry.
That's interesting, can you please explain more? I'm a lot more familiar with Scotch and American Whiskey, but I'm not well-versed on the different distilling methods. I thought the main difference was Bourbon using new oak and Scotch using refill barrels.
It‚Äôs $150 from FineDrams! (talk about steal of the century)
Cognac and malt whisky use slightly different forms of double pot distillation. Wash goes into a still, which gives low wines at \~25% ABV. The second distillation of the low wines is then separated into heads, hearts, and tails, giving spirit at \~65-70% ABV. Both are most often filled into refill oak casks, with malt whisky being a mix of American and French oak with or without previous contents, whereas cognac is exclusively filled into French oak (with some exceptions, but those can't be called cognac anymore).

&#x200B;

Armagnac and bourbon are both primarily distilled in continuous column stills. Unlike the column stills used for grain whisky, rum, vodka, etc, these tend to be on the shorter side (armagnac stills sometimes only half half a dozen or so plates) and direct all of the vapor reaching the top of the still into the condenser (this is in contrast to larger scale continuous stills where the spirit pipe tends to be several plates below the top of the column). Some bourbon stills also use a continuous pot still called a doubler or thumper, but that basically acts like another plate in the column, just on a bigger scale. They tend to come off the still at 55-60% for armagnac and 60-80% for bourbon. Both tend to be filled into new oak, French for armagnac, American for bourbon. My personal theory is that the designs of those stills necessitate new oak because they tend to be rougher spirits that contain more 'heads' than what come off of double pot stills or Savalle/Coffey continuous column stills.
I just realized this was a pick you guys did, how exciting! I only knew about the hail yak bottles(which are both fantastic). And I was already thinking of doing another FineDrams order, dag nabbit...
That's all very interesting, thank you for the thoughtful reply. I forgot to reply back to this comment the other day, sorry. I knew about the differences in wood, and I had a feeling that Armagnac was aged in new oak based on the flavor. How come Bourbon can get ""over-oaked"" so easy after 10-20+ years in new oak, yet Armagnac can be aged in new oak much older than that and still be good? Is it just a simple matter of the cooler aging temperatures in France vs the American south?
The other JLP we picked, the lot 92, is a little more of a bruiser :-)
Oh you may also not know that lot 73 = distilled 1973; lot 92 = 1992
Filling strength is probably a piece. Armagnac is traditionally distilled to a very low proof, so it may only be going into the cask at 55% or less. In contrast bourbon tends to be over 60%, which is going to have more extractive power. I‚Äôve seen some theories that lower filling proofs were part of why bourbon used to be better, since it wasn‚Äôt getting as oak-y and didn‚Äôt require as much dilution to get to bottling strength. 

Climate is a huge part. Kentucky not only gets hotter, but also has larger swings in temperature, which will move the spirit in and out of the wood more often as it expands and contracts. 

Some of it may also be scale. The small cellars in Gascony will have smaller temperature swings than the small rickhouses in Kentucky, which will have smaller swings than the big rickhouses.
I think the cask size can be quite large for French brandies, which would help with keeping the extraction manageable. I also get the impression that re-racking into older containers is practiced more than new-oak-all-the-way, it depends on the producer.
Armagnac usually only spends a few years in new French oak before being transferred to used 420L casks, and then into glass demijohns for the really old vintages (>45-50 years).  A few producers are known for aging entirely in new oak (i.e., Pibous) and it really shows in the profile.

Besides what others have added here (climate, cask size, filling proof) there's also the fact that armagnac (and cognac) barrels are toasted, not charred like bourbon barrels.  This has a huge impact on the pace and type of oak extraction, and many US craft distillers learned this the hard way by filling their usual charred casks with brandy and having it come out tasting like cordwood after a couple years.
Yeah I figured it out once I checked them out on FineDrams. I didn't realize they were more picks you guys had done. I was only familiar with the hail yak bottlings. 

Also, isn't it pretty late for you right now over there? Or are you up early?
Yeah you're right a lot of Bourbon's wood influence isn't just about warmer temps, but the wildly swinging temperatures. France is more about that steady cellar temp for aging wine I bet.

Interesting concept about Armagnac using a lower entry proof. I know Wild Turkey used to have a low entry proof into the barrel, a lot of people say that's partly why dusty Turkey is so good.
I have heard of Armagnac sometimes being re-barreled several times, thanks for clarifying that. Is there a standard amount of time for it it to spend in the new oak generally? Also that's really interesting about toasted vs charred, I hadn't even considered that. I know Bourbon producers will use different levels of char to achieve different flavor profiles, so it all makes sense. I actually have a 2oz sample of a Rye right now from Michter's that is toasted barrel, curious about that now. 

Funny you should mention Pibous, I'm new to all this and I only have 3 bottles of Armagnac, but my favorite is a 1995 24yr Domaine Lous Pibous, 56.1%. I don't notice it being dramatically oakier than the other 2 Armagnacs I have, so maybe that's just the style I enjoy? these are the bottles that made me ask why they don't seem over-oaked at such a ripe age compared to Bourbon? Was this bottle likely aged in new oak for it's whole life?
Baby needed a very early morning soothing
This paper only looks at malt whisky up to three years, but does should some real differences in how how even slightly different filling strength can change the amounts of various compounds extracted into the spirit. 


http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/jhb/whisky/papers/charring.htm
No standard amount of time, it really just depends on the producer and the style they're aiming for.

Oaky armagnacs do seem to appeal to those accustomed to bourbon or whisky.  Pibous is aged in new oak it's whole life, as are a few others on the market (the ""Mars"" from Domaine de Pouchegu).  Houses like Jean Bon, Baraillon and Ravignan are also known for heavy oak, but I don't think it's entirely new oak."

*****

**""Fragile"" sample #2: 1967 Charpentier 50yr, Cadenhead, Cognac Petite Champagne, 56% (done blind)**

**Nose:** Sweet and creamy, at first I thought I was in WHEATER heaven but it's so sweet and fruity that I'm thinking it might be an Armagnac. Sweet grape, butterscotch, vanilla, icing, fruit candy, smooth toasted wood.

**Taste:** Brash heat, wood and gritty caramel, butterscotch, huge tart fruitiness, smooth grape sweetness, some ashy char

**Finish:** Huge finish of creamy butterscotch and smooth toasted oak with mellow spice and menthol

*****

I don't have enough experience with Armagnac to know if there's wildly varying styles, but this is totally in line with the awesome flavors I've come across so far. Huge sweet fruitiness with creamy richness and perfect barrel notes. The heavy wood influence and spice in Armagnac really remind me a lot of Bourbon, I keep wondering if this is a super sweet Wheater or something as I drink it. But it has a sweetness and fruitiness that is just off the charts compared to Bourbon, so I'm stickin with the yak as a guess.

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** Holy shit, 50 years! It was somehow not super oaky at all to me, if anything it was quite a bit sweeter with less barrel influence than some 20-30yr stuff I've had. Still plenty of action going on here too, it wasn't overly mellow or smooth at all. Fun to do blind, I think if I had known it was 50 years old I might have been on the lookout for amazing quality and maybe even scored it higher. Delicious stuff.

**""Fragile"" sample #3: Brora 1981 25yr, Duncan Taylor, 56.5% (done blind)**

**Nose:** Malty Scotch, it's smells rich yet tame and well-balanced. Caramel malt, bright green apple, fruity citrus, menthol, wood, vanilla icing

**Taste:** Sweet and bright malty goodness. Bright fun malt, citrus zing, it's pretty hot too. Sweet barley sugar, bright vanilla, it just pops compared to the mellow nose

**Finish:** Killer finish. The heat and delicious malt smooths out and rides a long time with rich caramel, sweet fruits and citrus

*****

This is delicious, a bright and sweet malt-bomb. It's very well balanced, it's light on barrel notes but showcases the malt wonderfully without any off-putting new make or ethanol notes. I'm a sucker for a good malt bomb, so I'm gonna score this high. A good malty Scotch is one of those things that is so simple that it's deceptively hard, the spirit and wood has to speak for itself without any heavy-handed wine or peat influence to help it along. It's hard to make a guess since this could be a hundred different things, but it's cask strength and I like to think it is a refill barrel with some age on it to achieve such balance.

**Post-Reveal Thoughts:** Holy shit! What else can I say haha! It would be impossible to dive into a sample like this without bias if you knew what it was, what an epic Scotch to drink blind. The fact that I disliked the previous blind sample meant I was ready for anything here, so it's really awesome to see that that the quality of this Scotch absolutely shines through. This is actually my 2nd Brora and so far the reputation seems well earned. I can't thank u/xreekinghavocx enough for this.

Always nice to see a blind review that confirms that the hype on something like this is deserved. Would love to try Brora, but the prices are something else.
This one was unpeated yes?

Makes me wonder what casks Diageo is sitting on at Clynelish because the style is very similar
Where do people get these samples?
What an insane blind!! You made it sound really nice, too. Great stuff!
The one I tried was good but not life-altering, though I will admit that was part of a larger tasting so I don‚Äôt think my palate was in the best possible condition.
Yes unpeated. I believe Brora stopped making peated Whisky in the early or mid 70's, it was only temporary to help during a draught on Islay. I think I've seen people getting smoke from Brora in reviews, but the 2 I've had now has been zero smoke for me.
Some of us are in a whisky group that trades these samples amongst each other.
>What an insane blind!!

right? I love it when something can live up to the hype, and doing this blind really solidifies it for me since I couldn't bring any preconceptions into it. Such a great way to try it.
I‚Äôm willing to risk it :). Well, depending on how much I‚Äôd have to pay...
Yessss
That‚Äôs the crux. Even in 2013 they were well out of reach for me."

**""Fragile"" sample #1: Glen Grant 24yr, Scotch Malt Whisky Society, refill Bourbon, 50.8% (done blind)**

**Nose:** Kind of light and generic Scotch nose, and very muted. Right off the bat it reminds me of a cheap Glen or Balvenie or something, nice but nothing special. Malt, light caramel, stale wood, lightly floral, young spirit

**Taste:** Much bigger and hotter on the palate than the muted nose had me thinking. Sharp bright zing of malt and citrus, ethanol burn, bright sweet caramel, vanilla, fresh fruity spirit, some richer butterscotch tries to break through with some air time but overall it's just too hot and light on flavor.

**Finish:** Lackluster finish, lightly floral and malty, peppery heat, ethanol burn.

*****

It's oddly devoid of flavor for how bright and hot it is. I'm guessing it's higher ABV than your standard 40-46% but not super high either, it's hard to gauge with the heat and lack of depth. It's not outright ""bad"" or heavy on that new-make flavor, but the combination of heat and delicate flavor isn't doing a lot for me.

When I first opened it and saw it was a 24yr Scotch from SMWS, I thought ""well geez did I just shit on some really nice Scotch?"" But yeah it wasn't horrible, just didn't do a whole lot for me. It was nice starting with the dud, set me up to really be open-minded with the rest.
You‚Äôve still got one to go, right? Really curious what you think of the last one!

This stuff does exactly what it sets out to do and does it well. A pleasant sipper that is smooth and approachable without beating you over the head or being too pricey.

its one thats been on my list to try, i got it to give a secret santa gift. The recipient was nice enough to crack it open to let us sample. Glad i snagged it we enjoyed and I would buy again.
After researching and advice from reddit bot this was my first bourbon. So far I feel like it was a good introductory choice, thinking Eagle Rare next.
Readily available in NY.
No maraschino cherry notes?!? To me, this is always a complete cherry bomb, and one of the reasons I keep this stocked at all times! It's a great entry level bourbon and cheap here in MN (23 bucks a bottle).
I like this stuff.. its easy to drink.... good bourbon to introduce you to the  joy of bourbon
Feel like I need to give this one another shot.  Had it years ago and was not that impressed but see in other places too people very positive about it.  Ended up using the bottle I had mostly for mixers.
I just want to know where I can find the yellow monkey painting in the background.
Just tried this for the first time last night, it's my first time with any alcohol that isn't beer or wine. Was much smoother than I expected.


Any recommendations for a follow up once I'm done with this bottle? Doesn't necessarily have to be a bourbon
My favorite BT product. It's good and available, not overpriced. Friends I offer pours of Buffalo Trace always call it smooth.
Sipping on some now. I‚Äôm enjoying the flavors and nose but do find it a bit bland. I‚Äôm starting to avoid bourbons under 100 proof as I‚Äôm finding it doesn‚Äôt have that punch of flavors that I like. I like to have this around but it‚Äôs not worth it to chase it when there‚Äôs bottles I can get that are a little cheaper that I enjoy more. WT101 or EW BiB
I'm in California, and it seems widely available here. It's weird because it will disappear fast from certain stores sometimes, but generally you can still find it pretty easily for under $30.
I‚Äôm not gonna drink this BT unless I have to. But if I have to I‚Äôll be pretty happy with it!
Try them all. A lot of people want to be the authority when it comes to their debaucherous ways. If you like it, enjoy it and don't let someone else's review deter you.
I always associate cherry with a kind of sickly-sweet cough syrup flavor, I get it a lot with Four Roses in the Private Selects. I get a more sweeter candy type of cherry in Rye a lot too. But to me this one is total oak and corn, maybe I'll pour some more and look for those cherry notes.
Agreed, it's a great starter Bourbon. It was one of my earlier Whiskeys that I drank neat.
It's a great starter Bourbon as I mentioned a few times here, you did good. If you wanna try more Bourbon I'd recommend Evan Williams Single Barrel, Eagle Rare, or Four Roses Small Batch. And it may sound funny, but when is the last time you had Wild Turkey 101? The 101 is actually a really solid Bourbon to drink neat, it's still a go-to for a lot of us Whiskey nerds.

If you wanna try some Rye Whiskey, Bulleit Rye is a great one(their Bourbon is good too).

For a good starter Scotch I recommend Glenlivet 12, Glenfiddich 12, Macallan 12, or Balvenie 12

Most of this stuff is in the same price range(around $30) and can pry be found at bars.
I'm in Florida, you are lucky to find it on a liquor store shelf and it often is limited bottles per customer when you do. I try to keep a bottle as it would be my daily but is hard to keep in stock

Funnily enough it is readily available at bars and not very pricey.
I‚Äôm in so. Cal. If you have a Sams Club Membership you can pick it up right now for $20. Got me a bottle today. Good deal.
After 7yrs of drinking bourbon I still have no pallate to describe all the flavors.


I do however know what I do and don't like and can discern why. That's all that matters to me.
I'm with you.  I know nothing about the nose, the mouthfeel, the finish,  or notes of rancid cabbage.

I just know what I like."

*****

**High West ""A Midwinter Nights Dram,"" Act 6 Scene 6 (2018), 49.3%**

**Nose:** Strong Rye character of peppery rye spice and dill, burnt caramel, vanilla, integrates wonderfully with smooth chocolate, toasted oak, dark fruits, tart berry. 

**Taste:** It has a darkly sweet and mysterious quality to me. Smooth caramel, dark toasted wood, gritty wine char, tasty Rye spice, sweet cherry, dark fruit and tart berries with baking spices, faint menthol. With significant time in the glass more smooth peppery Rye notes and brighter sweet fruits emerge. Definitely benefits a lot from air.

**Finish:** The fruity sweetness brightens up very nicely with pleasant Rye spice and lingering menthol.

*****

I go back and forth on this stuff, it's definitely one I have to be in the mood for. I usually feel like the Port influence is too strong and overpowers the Whiskey, the flavor becomes overly dark and kind of closed. But some days it just seems to hit the spot or more Rye flavor seems to emerge, and it's an interesting Whiskey either way. This one has been open for about a year and is halfway finished, and I feel like air has improved it a lot. I know there's some differing opinions about different releases and this one being the first to contain High West's own distillate, but honestly of the four releases I've had(haven't tried 2019 yet) they seem pretty consistent.

I just got my first bottle this week! Mine is Act 7 Scene 6... do you know the significance of the Acts/Scenes? I heard it was the year, and I read that 2017 was Act 5 (making act 7 a 2019 bottle) and the Scene is the bottling batch. Any insight here or is everyone else as lost as I am?
I initially thought this was good but underwhelming. Now with some time I get a lot more port than before and I love it.  Definitely have to be in the mood for a sweet drink though.
You are correct, the Act is the year. Act 7 is the current 2019 release, and Act 6 is the 2018 release, and so on. As far as I know the ""Scene"" doesn't mean much. I believe each year or ""Act"" is a single batch, but they release the bottles in several waves or ""Scenes.""

How do these two ryes compare and is rendezvous rye worth the 50-60 price tag?

Thanks for the response! Head to head WhistlePig 10 and. Rendezvous rye, which should I go with?

(Already had pikesville, it‚Äôs amazing!)
look at you lol
Yeah I think this one is my favorite too. My other favorite is the blue and white one(I lost track of which year is which), but I don't like that it's missing the normal HW logo.
Nice! It's good stuff and they are some beautiful looking bottles, I'm sure he'll love it.
Yeah they do some really good and interesting stuff for sure.
Mine took so long compared to some others around here, I was worried it wasn't gonna come. So hopefully yours is still on the way
Not sure if you're aware, but MWND is Rendezvous Rye but with additional aging in Port Barrels. RR is good stuff, it's better than the cheaper Double Rye imo being a little older and sourced from a better mashbill Rye. At the price I would suggest WhistlePig 10 or Pikesville, but any of those 3 will be good.
I'd say WhistlePig for sure, it has a 10yr age statement, 100% Rye mashbill, and is bottled at 50% ABV. Only possible drawback is the price. I see it for $60, but a lot of places charge up to $80 which is high. It just depends on your area and the stores that carry it. 

A few other options are Russels Reserve Single Barrel Rye, Knob Creek Single Barrel Rye, and Wild Turkey 101 Rye. All good stuff and similarly priced I believe, but the WP would be my first choice.
I'm in Canada, so I expect it'll take longer.  I just can't remember when I stopped bitching that last year's was taking so long to arrive.  I think it was before the end of the year.

**Wild Turkey Cornerstone Rye, 54.5%**

**Nose:** Rich and creamy with big clean Rye notes, as a Rye lover I really like this nose. Creamy butterscotch, mellow and peppery Rye spice, big smooth menthol, dill, toffee, clean toasted wood, char, nice dignified must

**Taste:** Smooth, rich, and instantly recognizable as a Rye. Clean toasted wood and big sweet caramel with a smooth, effortless Rye character of menthol and spice, super tasty. Some dry fruity sweetness, vanilla, butterscotch, wood must, peppery tingle

I've never been a big fan of Wild Turkey Rye(or bourbony Rye in general) and I was expecting to be underwhelmed by this, but it's excellent. Lot's of delicious and well balanced Rye flavor shines through here. It has a smooth yet effortlessly flavorful quality that Wild Turkey always pulls off so well, and it's delicious at this age. Unfortunately it's a little subdued and overly smooth for my personal tastes, it's very well-executed but something is stopping it just short of greatness and I wish the finish was better. That's a little nitpicky, but I take Rye very seriously and at the price they're charging I'm allowed to be picky anyway. At $100-$120 I would probably grab this, but $150-$175 is a tough sell. Maybe not insane in today's market, but it would definitely take some soul-searching for me.

I'm a HUGE fan of their Russell's Reserve SiB Rye.  I've also heard that when you consider the price premium (about 3times the price), there isn't enough of a difference between the two lines to warrant the cost.  I can pick this up for $184 and was curious as to your thoughts between the two lines.
Nice review. The price point is tough for me, and apparently a lot of other people too because I tend to see these sitting on shelves for a while despite how good they usually are. It will be really interesting to see how this compare to the upcoming Rare Brees Rye release.
I‚Äôm actually drinking this right now.  It‚Äôs about 10% better than WFE 4 yr to me at about 4x the price.  It‚Äôs growing on me a bit and I do like it with salty/savory food, but I can‚Äôt see buying another bottle unless I see it on close out for $99 or something.
Nice review and I‚Äôm glad that you enjoyed it! I would agree with your ranking as well as your thoughts regarding value. I had to think hard about this one but bit the bullet with the understanding I was paying a premium for this ‚Äúlimited edition‚Äù bottle.
I haven't drank a whole lot of RR Rye before sorry, but for me this is definitely on a much higher level than the ones I've tried. I generally don't care for barely legal 51% Ryes like Wild Turkey and Kentucky does, they can just taste too much like a Bourbon to me. So the stronger Rye character here is a lot of what appeals to me. Sorry if that's not much help.
Yeah, even though this is a damn good whiskey, it's hard to say it's worth the $185 I paid for it.  I don't regret it, because it's a limited release I'll never get to have again once the bottle is gone, but it's not $100 or more better than a lot of other bottles I have.
I hadn't heard of a Rare Breed Rye release, interesting. The only BP Rye they have now is the single barrel, so I guess they would be able to batch a Rare Breed for a consistent profile. I always look forward to a new BP Rye on the market, hope it's good.
Thanks dude. Like I said to someone else, I would maybe grab this if half my budget wasn't going to Scotch since I am a huge Rye fan and this is an interesting one. I just think of some really great Scotches I could get for $150-$200 and have trouble justifying the current price. If I ever see it closer to the $125 mark I might give in. I know I saw some of the earlier Master's Keep bottles get discounted after sitting on the shelf for a long time.

Honestly I didn't love it at first, it's clearly very nice stuff but I tend to prefer bigger and bolder flavors. I really like a big meaty malt-bomb. But I've given it some time and the last pour really grew on me, so I have high hopes and I'm waiting to review it.

I haven't opened the ardmore because I happen to have a 12yr exclusive malts opened already. Looking forward to it someday though"
Now this is a Dalmore I can get behind,,https://i.redd.it/28kcuuv2ri241.jpg,"a Dalmore that doesn't reek of raisins and syrup?
That's way too pale looking for a Dalmore, can't be any good!
Something looks off.... is it labeled correctly?
That sounds like a great store and that would explain why that Dalmore just ain‚Äôt around. There‚Äôs a couple of the 2019 SCN I missed/passed. The Imperial sounded really good and it went fast.looking forward to the Ledaig. Cheers
Wow!! I‚Äôd definitely be interested in hearing your thoughts/notes on this one! OB Dalmores are such a travesty that I really want to know what an IB integrity bottling is like
Right? The 12yr seemed like a lesson on how not to sherry a Scotch, and then how to overcharge for it. This stuff is good, and surprisingly smoky.
Yeah sometimes the phone camera seems to throw in some funky angles all on it's own
I've heard some bad stuff about imperial, that theres a good reason it was shut down lol. I've only ever tried one and it wasn't all that good. I realize one bottle doesn't necessarily mean anything though.
I'll probably review it here pretty soon, but I like it so far. Nothing like the OB bottlings I've had, like I commented before it's surprisingly peaty
I'd give that a go for sure.  Nothing but disappointments from Dalmore line for me.
Ha, that looks and sounds really good. I just checked, Binny‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt have it, damn.
But I did just pick up a bottle of that 13 year old SCN Ledaig. Looking forward to that.
Yea, I don‚Äôt feel too bad at all about missing out on it. With how fast it disappeared, I‚Äôm thinking the flippers bought it up thinking, a closed distillery, this is going to be gold. That said, I have a 20 year old 1995, (there‚Äôs a ton of them from 1995) Signatory, 50.2% that‚Äôs pretty good but I‚Äôve read enough reviews where they are really hit and miss. I think you are on to something as there‚Äôs a reason they shut down. That dalmore does sound good though.
Actually I really enjoyed their Portwood Reserve, its 46.5% and has some pretty rich and interesting flavor. It's still way overpriced though I think for a NAS.
It's actually really peaty, I'm surprised. It's bottled in 2013, so I wouldn't think binnys would have it. The store where I got it has lots of old stock, theres stuff in there from the early 2000's. I go when I'm visiting family for goodies like this

That Ledaig is delicious, you're gonna enjoy it. Uou must be close to having the whole 2019 SCN lineup at this point haha"
"Review #115, Craigellachie 12 sherry butt 59.9% ""Sovereign"" K&L pick",,https://i.redd.it/quknu7nzv4241.jpg,"**2006 Craigellachie 12yr, Sovereign K&L pick, sherry butt, 59.9%**

**Nose:** Rich caramel malt, sulfur, fruity-sweet and friendly sherry, orange, caramel, smooth sweet chocolate, cherry, spice tingle. Sweet and inviting sherry nose with lots of caramel and rich malt

**Taste:** Big flavor, it's hot and brash compared to the friendly nose. Sharp sherry funk and bright sweet fruits attack the palate with a hot zing, some water mellows it very nicely. Big spice and sweet happy fruits, strawberry, gritty burnt caramel, warm orange zest, dark cherry, big sherry funk, toasted wood, rich malt, sulphur.

**Finish:** Tons of warm spices and sweet strawberry with rich, oozing caramel and sulfury wine. It's a long, lumbering and sweet finish. Very nice 

*****

This bottle grew on me the longer I had it open, as cask strength sherry often does for me. It was a little hot and brash at 59% but not as bad as you would think, and a little water really made it something nice. The rich malt and sweet sherry flow together beautifully, and that meaty Craigellachie malt really gives it a lot of oomph. Lot's of fun sweetness but lots of other interesting flavors too, not just a straight-up sherry bomb. Wasn't quite ""run out and buy another bottle"" or ""sad to see it go"" good, but a bottle I thoroughly enjoyed. And at K&L's prices worth every penny.

good to hear! I have one of these unopened and another from that release, I believe the caol ila, that some friends have given good reviews too!
Sounds like a good one. I need to try some sherry cask aged Craigellachie. K&L seems to have a pretty good selection. Nice descriptive review.
Thanks dude. This is my first sherried Craigellachie, but they have a very robust maltiness that I suspect would work very well with sherry in general.
üëç. I‚Äôve had a few Craigellachie‚Äôs, both bourbon cask too that have been really good  but never a sherry cask aged one. There have been a few reviews of sherry cask aged Craigellachie that have been stellar. I think you are right in that it works well with sherry. I would add Benrinnes to this discussion as well.

**Four Roses Small Batch Limited Edition 2016, 55.6%**

**Nose:** Creamy and rich, a beautiful nose. Butterscotch and toffee, sharp toasted oak, must, floral and perfumy, red hot cherry, spice tingle

**Taste:** Sweet bright cherry and spice, candy corn, tons of butterscotch and creamy caramel, mint. There's some gritty charred oak but it takes a backseat to all the sweet and creamy flavor. It's all amazingly balanced though, just beautiful.

**Finish:** Bright sweet cherry and super rich caramel with some really nice spice, long excellent finish

*****

Super sweet and lively, but it's balanced with huge rich & creamy flavors and that beautifully toasted Four Roses oak. This is amazing stuff, and and at this point I expected no less. These LE's have been a lot of fun. It's remarkable how unique each one has been, they all have a very distinct personality that seems to showcase different elements of their Bourbon. I""m digging the sweet creaminess of this one.

I will continue to enjoy the brashness and huge flavor of the Private Selects, but trying these Limited Edition bottlings has made me sad that I can't enjoy this side of the distillery more. Sometimes hype doesn't live up to reality, but in this case it really does. Seeing for myself just how fucking good these are makes me sad that I will probably never own one :(

Man, you‚Äôre on fire, this one didn‚Äôt do it for me, too hot, except maybe the last third of the bottle, why oxydation, it became smoother and more drinkable. Great review as always, cheers!
I agree. This was too hot for me too. I preferred the '17 and 130th
Same here, and don‚Äôt make talk about the 2019, it‚Äôs a killer one, just did a sbs with 2015, my all time favorite, close but the 2015 is still the best for me. Next time I‚Äôll try blind it‚Äôs more fair. 2017, excellent stuff, same as 2018.
I still need to try the '19! I haven't done side by sides with anything older than '16 though
They did one hell of job with the 2019, first pour of the freshly opened bottle, I was hooked, it‚Äôs rye fruit oaky bomb, delicious, wish you luck to find one, worth the hunt for sure. Cheers!

**Taste:** Everything I love about Four Roses but so ridiculously huge and balanced. Fruity and floral vibrancy with huge clean Bourbon corn, caramel, PERFECTLY toasted oak, chocolatey wood, varnish, perfume, cherry syrup. As someone who has drank a lot of Private Selects, this has a lot of very familiar flavor but dialed up to 11 and done to perfection.

*****

Don't know what else to say, as a big fan of Four Roses this is about as good as it gets. The 2014 Small Batch LE I had before this seemed to showcase more of the dark syrupy sweetness, this is bright and vibrant which is more up my alley. But it still has plenty of creamy richness and just the right amount of oak. Everything I love about Four Roses dialed up to 11. Easily My favorite of the 3 LE's I've tried so far, with the 2013 Single Barrel 13yr OBSK a very close 2nd.

Plus a mutated yeast that was never used again: 
 
https://www.straightbourbon.com/community/topic/24585-the-four-roses-v-yeast-that-wasnt-really-a-v/ 
 
I mean, damn!
Great review! My favorite of the FR LEs that I've tried.
Cheers dude! [I just replied to a similar comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/dztvo4/review_113_four_roses_small_batch_limited_edition/f8bcxy6/). Also, I'm happy I get to enjoy even more of this elixir. I happened to have a 2nd sample, thanks to a certain awesome Belgian who gave it to me as a gift ;)
Wow that's pretty cool, thanks. But I only see him talking about the 2012 and 2013 Small Batch LE and some other gift shop bottles, not this one?
I find it very strange that they would have not stored the yeast given that they went ahead and distilled the product. My assumption is that the ‚Äúblooming‚Äù referred to in your link is based on the phenotype of a batch sample that has been plated out (on agar in a Petri dish); without having any knowledge of the process, I would think that this would be regular QC protocol. They would have needed to investigate the aberrant yeast fairly closely to determine salability of the distillate, so one would think that a culture would be preserved for reference. It‚Äôs probably tucked away in the back of a -80 freezer somewhere in the distillery. 

Let me say that I haven‚Äôt fermented grain before, but I am a microbiologist who specializes ascomycete cytology (Ascomycota is the Division of fungi that includes yeast, such as *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, or ‚Äûbrewer‚Äôs yeast‚Äú) I work with filamentous fungi, but am intimately familiar with budding genera, not so much *Saccharomyces*, but use *Pichia pastoris* as a protein expression system.   Fungi, in general, tend to easily mutate and special care is taken to preserve specific strains. I have many questions that I suppose I‚Äôm more extending to others who may stumble upon your comment, but the first is how the mutation was first realized. Also, how did they determine it was a mutation of yeast V and not a contaminant? How much of the batch‚Äòs yeast consisted of the mutated V strain? And, to the issue of it being beneficial, how could they allow the product go to market without keeping tabs on something as important as the yeast. 

I can tell you if I was on that your, the guide would‚Äôve hated me by the end of it... ha, ha... but seriously...
I always forget about that forum...
Thanks, me too although it's only the 3 so far. I went in kinda blind not knowing that there was so much love for this particular year, kinda cool that I came to a similar conclusion. It really is an amazing Bourbon.
I‚Äôve sent some indeed, enjoy it, it‚Äôs an epic pour. Cheers!
Right, not that one. But it was Rutledge‚Äôs last LE before he resigned/retired. And the last really knock out one (until the Al Young and maybe this year).
Yep, I'm stupid, I saw your notes, they were awesome, and when I see awesome 4R LE SmB notes, I think 2013 even when it's wrong.
Well, the tour I was on went into a lot of detail about how they handle yeast, which would answer a lot of your questions. They keep aliquots of all of their yeasts at -80, yes, and use a new aliquot for every batch of fermentation. They make a starter culture to get them growing again and then expand in a larger culture to make enough for a fermentation batch. My guess is that the mutation happened early on, though the story didn't go into enough detail about how it behaved in a dish, whether every colony was odd or if only some were, so I don't know how much of it was mutated. I doubt it was a contaminant because that would really throw things off as far as pH, fermentation time, the smell of the beer and its alcohol content, and those almost certainly would have caused them to dump the batch. From the post, it sounds like at least one of those parameters was off, but it wasn't so bad that they assumed an infection. 
 
Since they always assume their yeast is mutated or just messed up from the fermentation conditions at the end of every batch, and not suitable for re-use, I doubt they saved any for a reference. It wouldn't have been useful anyway because it likely wouldn't have maintained its properties for more than one or two more batches. Instead, I imagine all they did after this was to grow up a few more aliquots and see if they behaved similarly in a dish. Once they saw that they were normal and that it wasn't an issue with their aliquots, they probably continued with standard procedures. 
 
""how could they allow the product go to market without keeping tabs on something as important as the yeast."" - they do keep tight tabs on the yeast, that's why they use new aliquots every time and do tests on pH, alcohol, fermentation time, etc. They check every batch to see if it needs to be dumped. 
 
I have a Ph.D. in genetics, btw, and have done yeast two-hybrids, so I have a teensy bit of first-hand knowledge of yeast behavior. My father-in-law also brews beer, which is probably even more relevant. Their story seems to make sense to me, it was just a weird batch that happens sometimes. I think they might have played up the ""I wish I hadn't thrown it out"" angle. They would have had to have saved some of the yeast early on, like in the starter culture, and re-frozen it, but there's no need to do that because they have thousands of aliquots already saved.
Very interesting perspective, I hope you get an answer. Totally different field I know, but I'm a maintenance tech/mechanic and I will often have questions too about specialized processes and equipment that many others take for granted. Unfortunately it's hard to get answers to this stuff a lot of times
Gotcha. I remember everyone going gaga over that Al Young bottle. As much as I love Four Roses I dont even really pay attention to these LE's just because they are so impossible to get. I'd rather not stress it, and concentrate on Barrel Selects. I was lucky just to get these couple of samples but now I'm kind of realizing what I've been missing out on :(
No problem haha. I haven't had the '12 or '13, but these LE's and so much of their other Bourbon is fantastic stuff and worth getting excited about
Yeah, I would think smell and etOH excretion would be something that could be noticed in the vat without culturing out a sampler. They all smell the Same, but different, you know... Obviously this wouldn‚Äôt apply to chemical analysis and there are several fungi to be weary of too, but I used to work in a plant pathology lab and sometimes we‚Äôd need to isolate a fungus from plant tissue to see what it was. Almost instinctively, once a colony began to grow, I‚Äôd crack open the plate and give a few gentle sniffs‚Äîpretty diagnostically useful... naturally I have some background and wouldn‚Äôt huff something like suspected *Aspergillus fumigatus* or *A niger*. But otherwise, it‚Äôs fun to make undergrads cringe ;-)

I wish we‚Äôd get an ama with a distillery microbiologist. I‚Äôd eat that up!

Edit‚ÄîI just wanted to say (before I locked up my fungus nerd for the night)  that they if the yeast in question was responsible for such a good product and validated as such by Four Roses, they could have preserved it and it‚Äôs qualities, just as the have for their other strain. As we are discussing, fungal genetics can be ummm... hyper... certainly, and as a quick snapshot, it would be simple to extract the yeast‚Äôs genome for their library to be  available to clone if their *in vivo* stock failed. These guys are critical for the brands profile, just as Beam wouldn‚Äôt be Beam without that wonderful wet-basement-full-of-moldy-peanuts flavor imparted by their own proprietary yeast strain. The first thing to do would be be tedious but not hard or uncommon‚Äî they probably do similar for the up-keep of the other yeast at regular intervals. What would need to happen is they isolate a specimen of the yeast of interest, then take a single cell from it... perhaps a bud‚Äîseveral ones to ensure vitality and uniformity. It‚Äôs a single-cell Isolation. We do it with filamentous Ascos, only excise a single hyphal tip. an easy thing but not with shaky hands. 

I‚Äôm done but I do wonder if the disposal of the yeast was so they didn‚Äôt have to do all sorts of rebranding, testing, oversight, etc, if they ended up adding a fifth to the line up. Idk... just vocal diarrhea fro me and I‚Äôm taking my Imodium. Thanks for not Laughton at me :-) 

Also: ‚Äûexcise‚Äú not ‚Äûexcuse‚Äú and ‚Äûto the‚Äú, not ‚Äûthrough.‚Äú
Oh yeah, it's my favorite distillery :-)
Seagrams, the company they were part of before their current owner, had 300 or even more yeast strains frozen. I don't know what they're doing with them, but they have tons to choose from already.
I really want to learn more about this niche of my field. I couldn‚Äôt imagine the pride and satisfaction associated with being responsible for maintaining the yeast of a good bourbon. It‚Äôs hard work making any consumable standardized and I‚Äôd image the fermenting organism has to be one of the most frustrating and attention heavy factors outside of grain quality. I guess a lot of people may ignore the fungal component of their favorite foods... truly, if anyone else is reading this, I wonder how many people are realizing just now that yeast belong within Fungi. My experience is among midwestern friends (late 20‚Äòs-30s) and when my talk goes into anything fungal you can see dismay‚Äîphones and watches checked. I‚Äôm always shocked by how many people don‚Äôt like blue cheeses, how many people smell a black truffle and sneer at it. How har it is to get my friends to get mushrooms on their pizza, stuff like that. Is it because, in America, the most commonly sold ones are *Agaricus bisporus*, the button mushroom and the larger kind they sell as portobello‚Äîyes, these are lame. Of course, I suppose public dismay may be due to the saprophytic role that fungi play, if they knows out that. Honestly, also, I tend to skip and the pedestrian stuff and discuss things like insect-colonizing *Cordyceps* species, or interesting homologies among other Eukaryotic genomes... so sometimes biologist could be at blame. My SO is an actor; our friends are actors; I have a nice quiet place to work and drink bourbon so don‚Äôt feel too sorry for me :)

Edit, but more like a P.S.: I‚Äôm looking to get out of a rather stagnant employment situation and I find it hard to identify distiller/ brewery microbiologist careers. If you or anybody out there in bourbonville could point me in even the vaguest direction, I‚Äôd be obliged!

More edits‚Äîexciting topics, no character limits, typing on my iPhone‚Äîall recipes for my statements to look like a third grader wrote them. Fixed, for posterity, if anything
My wife is also a Ph.D., and we love to buy cheese with bacteria on it (the one that makes penicillin) and watch the cheese get gooey over time as the microbes work through it. We eat it with gusto. Cheers!
Now wait a second... Hopefully your not messing with me *Penicillium roqueforti* is a fungus and the blue parts are its spores similarly a *P candidum* and *P   camembert* complex is used to house and sort of ‚Äûpre-digest‚Äú brie-like cheese products. Often fermented products use bacteria and the lactic acids they make for tangy flavor and some of those (i.e. salami) use a fungal coating for drying and protecting. With Blue cheeses, however, most of the flavor comes from the enzymatic degradation of the substrate (the cheese) by the fungus. 

Perhaps people get confused when we discuss fungi without obvious fruiting bodies like mushrooms, I can see some mix-ups in discussions sometimes. Most of the guys who make mushrooms, like we see in the woods or in Gnome paintings are of the Fungal division Basidiomycotia, while that is not universally true for all of them, and there are actually types of yeasts that fall under the Basidios. What we have been talking about are fungi in the division Ascomycota, these spend most of the time just as strings of hyphae and live absolutely everywhere. Their fruiting bodies are usually small with spores held outside the birthing structure. One exception are morel mushrooms (take a peek on the surface nex time with a strong lense). Ascos are the most important economically as they are used extensively in food (like our yeasts we‚Äôve been taking about) and molecular production for industry but they also represent a major group of human pathogens. Fungi are among the most prevalent and costly plant pathogens, too.  Some argue the most significant biotic stress to plants, but that‚Äôs silly thing to get in to here, of course. 

Sorry for all the babble and also sorry if the above was a simple typo. I‚Äôm bored anyway, so this was kind of fun, I guess...

Edit: some typos
You're right, I was distracted (and possibly dumb) and wrote ""bacteria"" when I just meant a generic  ""microbes"". I'm writing a grant proposal about fungal infections, so damn, pretty embarrassed here.
Ha! I let myself get all tied up in this. It was welcome, but I actually have eight tons of reading to do here.

**Four Roses Small Batch Limited Edition 2014, 55.9%**

**Nose:** Big metallic cherry, warm brooding cinnamon, mint, burnt caramel, sweet vanilla, perfect toasted oak, herbal spice. Complex and yummy

**Taste:** Mellow, but very rich and densely packed with flavor. Dark burnt toffee, big mint, chocolate, tons of sticky-sweet cherry cough syrup, rich charred oak. It's dark and burnt for a Four Roses but not in an oaky way, it still maintains that characteristic cherry syrup sweetness that always brings their Bourbons to a bright and pleasant place.

**Finish:** Smooth dark cherry and tons of cool minty spice, it's a long cool finish. Doesn't leave with a bang, but rather a cool smooth exit with its sunglasses on and a mischievous smile. Very nice.

*****

This stuff is super sweet, it's like a showcase for the sticky-sweet cherry cough syrup that I always get from their Bourbon. Like the 2013 SiB LE I tried before this, it has a very polished and finished feel. It suddenly strikes me how no matter what the age or flavor of these Four Roses bottlings, they are never heavy on the oak. They are so lively and fruity and herbal, but it's always a perfectly toasted kind of oakiness that doesn't overwhelm or intrude on the other flavors. Delicious stuff.

**Four Roses Single Barrel LE 2013, OBSK 13yr, 59.9%**

**Nose:** Huge and mellow. Thick burnt salted caramel, strong tannic and charred oak, peppermint candy, an antique must like an old book shop, a beautiful and pleasant floral quality like rich lavender scents. Doesn't attack the senses saying ""smell how delicious I am!"" It's rich and smoothly elegant.

**Taste:** Explosion of flavor, it's suddenly much brighter, sweeter, and mintier than I was expecting from the nose. Brightly sweet cherry red hots and tons of mint, sweet toffee, orange zesty zing, rich perfectly toasted wood. There's some gritty charred oak to give it some darker earthiness. It stays so incredibly balanced yet it pops with a clarity and suddenness that is delicious and lots of fun

**Finish:** The flavor just keeps coming and builds to an epic bright and sweet finish of hot cherry, cinnamon, and clean mint. Classic Four Roses flavor to me but on steroids, and the sweet cherry zing lingers for a ridiculous amount of time.

*****

This is fantastic stuff. It is an extraordinary example of a full proof Single Barrel, which is exactly what they were setting out to do I suppose. My experience with (usually younger)Private Selects is that they can be very lively and even harsh(in a good way), a cacophony of flavors that work well together. The age here has made something that feels amazingly polished and balanced but without sacrificing that vibrancy and huge exciting flavor.

It's nice knowing I still have some samples floating around out there. Great review and glad you enjoyed your first FR LE!
Yeah they sure do make some great bourbon. I never get tired of the endless variety and quality of their single barrel selects and stuff like this.
Thanks, and the next one which was from our friend Dixie is posted. Cheers!
We used to trade bottles and samples like this on a subeddit called r/scotchswap, but Reddit banned the sub and all trading activity last year. Many of us still have samples from back then or just trade with friends outside of Reddit now.
Yeah I miss the good 'ol days when I'd get randomly paged in other people's reviews, that's why I still page people. And I'm a slow drinker so I still have lots of stuff around from back then.

Honestly your account doesn't seem real active so I was worried I wouldn't hear from you. Glad you popped back in!
I still lurk pretty frequently. Just quietly drinking my way through all the crap I bought back in the day haha. Hopefully you get around to the other goodies I sent your way. If I remember correctly I sent you some tasty dusty Turkeys."
"Reviews #113/114, young peated Bunnahabhains",,https://i.redd.it/8941xhzuwcz31.jpg,"A side by side review of two very young peated Bunnahabhains. I've actually reviewed these each separately before, but it's been a while and I thought it would be fun to do them together.

*****

**3yr Staoisha(peated Bunnahabhain) 2013, John Milroy K&L pick, refill barrel, 56%**

**Nose:** Intense Islay peat smacks you in the face, tons of brine, metallic and mineral, sweet spirit, lemon, new make, tar

**Taste:** Huge sharp peat, its tastes super clean and pure like ""essence of peat."" New make flavor that tastes like buttered popcorn, sweet mineral spirit, vegetal, metallic twang, Scotch heat, ashy tar. This is about as raw of a spirit as you can get and still be enjoyable, very interesting to taste actually.

**Finish:** It leaves with some sweet ashy char, light caramel, and tons of peat. A simple and stripped down finish but nice. 

*****

**4yr Bunnahabhain, Battlehill, oak casks, 58%**

**Nose:**  Huge smoky peat, brine, light buttery oak, sour wood, very light caramel, new make, lemon, mineral peat

**Taste:** Sweet caramel and huge smoky peat, funky oak, cake frosting, some light buttery richness. Simple and straightforward, sweet malty peat with some nice mild oak.

**Finish:** Builds to bright sweet vanilla frosting and huge peat, this has an excellent finish

*****

Both are delicious peat monsters, but they have some intersting differences. The 3yr is practically raw spirit, and I'm impressed with how well this works. The 4yr tastes like a much more active barrel, and I'm impressed at how delicious and balanced it is for a cheap young IB. Looking at the bottle however, it is a batch of 1152 bottles and doesn't actually say ""single barrel"" anywhere so I guess they did a good job batching it. The 4yr is without question the better Scotch between the 2, but the 3yr is just such an interesting and unique experience(and still delicious) that it has it's own merits. These were lots of fun to drink side by side, and either way it seems like Bunnahabhain can make some legit peated Islay Scotch.

**Score:** 

3yr Staoisha: **6**

4yr Battlehill: **7**

Really fun read!  Great concept and well written.  I'm actually currently sipping on a 9 year old heavily peated cask strength 2005 Bunnahabhain bottled by G&M.  It's also another young peated Bunna that works well and I find it to be right on par with Laphroaig 10CS in terms of quality.  I totally agree with this sentiment:

> it seems like Bunnahabhain can make some legit peated Islay Scotch.
My previous reviews of these:

The 3yr: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/ad1x3v/review_77_staoisha_3yrheavily_peated_bunnahabhain/

The 4yr, which I actually had as a mystery sample: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/72w92i/review_27_mystery_sample/
Great reviews! These both sound like fun drams. A big fan of peated Bunnahabhain.
Great head to head review, thanks for sharing! I‚Äôve got a 5yo peated Bunna from Cadenhead‚Äôs and I thoroughly agree with your sentiment -they can definitely do peat well!!
I have a Battlehill Bunnahabhain 6 and its an awesome peat monster. So much ash, smoke, and wood. I love this stuff. Its such a deal at $51. Its close to 60% ABV but it actually has very little burn
Love it! I have that 4 year Battlehill as well, and a buddy of mine just bought a bottle after trying it! Surprisingly great, especially considering that Battlehill doesn't have the best track record.  Really makes you want more peated Bunnahabhain, though!
Thanks dude. 9 years sounds interesting, I don't think I've seen one older than 5 or 6 years before. I think that's because they only started doing peated batches recently, I can't remember when though. I'd love to see how it does with some age on it like yours.

Islay distilleries can all have their own profiles, but these are too young for me to say. I guessed the 4yr was a Lagavulin 12 blind, it reminds me of that lean and mean no-frills Islay goodness. Any thoughts on a possible profile with your 9yr?
These are why I recommended that binnys bottle, it's such good stuff. Looking forward to hearing about your recharred barrel
Thanks for reading, I've heard about a slew of these bottles now and the consensus seems to be that they're good stuff
Totalwine? That is where my 4yr is from
My 9yr bottling was kind of an oddity in that it was matured in a ""first-fill sherry hogshead"" but it was rather light in color and there were very little in the way of traditional sherried scotch notes.  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/9w4h7d/review_40_gm_cask_strength_bunnahabhain_2005/) is my review of it, although I think it's a bit of a chore to read, as this was back when I was writing way too many words and not getting to the point.

Basically, to me it tastes like peated Hershey's chocolate in whisky form.  Intense peat and a butyric character to it that reminds me of classic Hershey's chocolate.  Some people could hate it, but for me it worked well.
Good call on the Binny‚Äôs 4 year old rechar. I‚Äôm glad I picked it up. It is good stuff. Really enjoyed the side by side. What a difference the extra year made and as you said, better barrel as well. If you don‚Äôt mind I‚Äôll copy you and do a side by side as well. I have a 14 year old heavily peated Bunnahabhain that will be fun to compare with this 4 year old recharred barrel. This 4 year old I have  has a lot of similar notes as yours. Really good stuff.
Yup. Totalwine. They are gone now, I wish I bought more than 1 bottle.
Great review, sounds really good. All the chocolate actually had me thinking of some Caol Ila I've had, I had to keep reminding myself it's a peated Bunna review. But Caol Ila releases so much stuff you're bound to find some similar peat notes eventually. Like you said, doesn't sound like a lot of sherry notes in there. 

>this was back when I was writing way too many words and not getting to the point.

I have the same problem with my reviews haha. I have so much to say, and before I know it I have written way too much. It's not like it's that hard to read a few paragraphs, but you just have to appreciate that a lot of people see all the words and don't even bother. I found the intro about the history real interesting, I had some idea but couldn't remember. Thanks!
14 years?!?! Someone else in this thread has a 9yr, and that is the first time I've even heard of one older than 5 or 6 years. From what I understand they only started doing peated scotch relatively recently, I cant remember when though.
oops, 13 year old. Here's my review [https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/7bz02i/review\_48\_bunnahabhain\_1997\_signatory\_heavily/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/7bz02i/review_48_bunnahabhain_1997_signatory_heavily/)
Yep, that sounds like a proper peated Islay. I'm confused though, I thought Bunnahabhain didn't start to do peated Whisky until 2003?
Yup, I may have been a little generous on that Malt mark. So, where‚Äôd you hear that about not doing peated until after 2003?
Here we go https://thewhiskeyjug.com/whiskey/11-expressions-of-peated-bunnahabhain-from-1997-and-2005-a-malt-nuts-tasting/
That page says they were one-off runs of peated whisky. This article makes it sound like they started doing peat regularly in 2003

https://www.cigaraficionado.com/article/how-bunnahabhain-scotch-got-its-peat-back-17986

But the wording in part of the article (""for the past 7 years,"" with the article written in 2015) makes it sound like it could be as late as 2008 as well. Not sure what to think
Maybe there have been a few ‚Äú unofficial‚Äù bottlings and the boys on the 3rd shift goofing around with a little peat? Not sure either."
"Review #112, Ben Nevis 21, Old Malt Cask K&L",,https://i.redd.it/1pybyltu06z31.jpg,"**1997 Ben Nevis 21yr, Old Malt Cask K&L pick, sherry butt, 57.7%**

**Nose:** The nose is a bit challenging with bitter oak and strong tart fruits that hit right off the bat. Warm caramel malt, orange, winey and syrupy fruit, light sweetness, menthol, wet wood earthiness. Some water mellows it all out and makes it more pleasant

**Taste:** Very dry and densely packed sherry flavor. Even with water I wish it was a little more open. Dark fruits and burnt caramel, rich malt, earthiness, toasted wood, tobacco, tart burnt fruits, kind of hot. 

**Finish:** Finally opens up and pops with some really nice flavor on the finish. Rich caramel and malt, nice fruity sweetness, peppery zing. Long malty finish that lingers with some very nice flavors. 

*****

It's not bad, but I can be very picky with my sherry and I think I prefer something that is a little more bright and sweet. The rich maltiness that shines through is my favorite part here, and the sherry just feels kind of closed and too densely packed, not well integrated. ""Challenging"" is the word that comes to mind, because there are nice flavors to be found even if it wasn't immediately satisfying. The delicious finish is what really saves it for me.

I think this Scotch is ridiculously good, closer to a 8.5. Then again, everyone's different and that's cool.
Nice review, I'm sorry to hear this one didn't work for you.  Older, sherried Ben Nevis is so good on paper.
Yeah, everyone's tastes are gonna be different. The bottle has been open for about a year and is only 1/4 full, so at this point I feel like I've given it a fair chance. And it just never totally clicked for me unfortunately.
Yeah I bought this after trying the SCN 20yr refill oloroso, that was fantastic. I was hoping for a similar experience, oh well. Other people seem to like this one more than I did though, so it might just be personal preference.
Oh, well, disregard my thoughts on ‚Äú give it a bit more time to open up‚Äù LOL, yeah, somethings it just doesn‚Äôt click. YMMV so to speak. Really nice review BTW. Sounds like an amazing finish.
I bought it after trying that SCN, but yeah it didnt work out as well. They've been redeemed though with that 10yr CS"
Delivery day,,https://i.redd.it/uk1h2a2yfny31.jpg,"Damn, that's a fantastic selection.
That octomore 8.2 is a dram of pure beauty. Will need to pick another up for myself soon.
Nice stuff there! I was eyeing 8.2 myself, especially at the sale price.
Who are you ordering from?
[deleted]
That's a lovely selection. The scotches all harmonize with the colors in your Drinking Monkey vintage poster too.
Looks excessively expensive.
Thanks, I thought so too! The octo and PC were no brainers for me, and even though they have lots of cool IB's I thought it would be interesting to try some cask strength OB's that I haven't seen here in the states
Didnt even realize who I was responding to at first. Thanks for the suggestion on the Loch Lomond, and someone else pointed me towards the Ben Nevis. They both look fantastic and probably wouldn't have been on my radar otherwise.
I haven't had it, but I love all the .2's and .3's I've had. Octomore really shines with a wine finish imo
I get excited at the chance for a .2 anyway, and at $130 theres no way I wasn't gonna buy it. Especially since the new .3's seem to be going for $200-$250 now. It's some of my absolute favorite scotch out there, but that's bonkers

Mostly I'll be painting my house, trying to get it done before the rain and snow hits. But these will be nice to sit down with at the end of the day!
>The scotches all harmonize with the colors in your Drinking Monkey vintage poster too.

Yeah that's mainly what I was going for. 

Actually it's cool that you commented just now, because I was just chatting with someone about how awesome your write-ups are around here. Your comments are always very informative and interesting, just thought I'd let you know :)

I know you have a lot of good stuff to say about Ben Nevis, have you had this bottling? It's fantastic, it's super dense with flavor and it's a beast of a Scotch. Pretty unique too. I'm new to the distillery, but I'm enjoying it.
I mean you're not wrong, but what can I say it's what I love spending my money on! I live in a rural area hours away from any decent stores, so I tend to do my shopping in big bursts when I visit a city or do a mail order like this.
Cheaper than The Whiskey Exchange?
Thanks, that's really very kind of you. The community here is so great, it makes me want to put maximum effort into each comment and if possible give back something of value.

Yes, I agree on that Ben Nevis. Ruben talked me (not literally, I mean by reading his blog) into getting one - he has that effect I'm afraid, much to the dismay of my budget.

It was a bit pricey, and I think a lot of folks marked it (the Batch No. 1 LE) down a bit because the regular OB 10 yo was so cheap by comparison, but putting that aside I like it a lot. I've heard that Ben Nevis is rather run down & obviously neglected by parent co. Nikka, especially judging from the very eye opening interview with Colin Ross which was posted on the whiskybase page. That is a pity, but perhaps better than being all glam'd up and turned into another Macallan. So perhaps B.N. being the ugly duckling of the scotch world isn't such a bad thing after all.

Early on in my online scotch explorations I almost pulled the trigger on a 43 year old Ben Nevis from 1970 which was unfortunately very substantially above the price range I was comfortable spending in. That's one that got away, but it would have been interesting to try it out, belonging as it does to the rather unusual category of *Single Blend* - a blended whisky made from grain & single malt whisky both produced at the same distillery. If I recall correctly those were made at Ben Nevis & Loch Lomond and not very many other places, and little has been produced in recent decades with the rise of single malts eclipsing blends in popularity for higher end scotches.

Who knows, with the impact of the recent USA tariffs, maybe that category will make a comeback.

Cheers
Anyway, I didn't mean to make it sound like you're the guy who buys the boat, with a garage in the side, for another boat. :P
Yes, we are generally cheaper than The Whisky Exchange, both in terms of product and shipping prices.
I've never ordered from them. Finedrams is where the r/Scotch bottlings(2nd and 3rd bottles from the right in the picture) and Armagnac pick(far right) are available, so that's the main reason I was ordering.

"Review #111, Bunnahabhain 10yr Signatory 1st fill sherry, Binny's",,https://i.redd.it/eyhcgui6xrx31.jpg,"Sample courtesy of u/nsquare14

*****

**2005 Bunnahabhain 10yr, Signatory Binny's selection, 1st fill sherry, 57.8%**

**Nose:** Rich oak and sticky-sweet fruits, thick malt, honey, dark chocolate, tobacco, vanilla, toffee, sweet cherry and strawberry, menthol tingle, dark burnt fruitiness.

**Taste:** Huge yet very clean flavor. Darkly sweet and rich with sweet fruits, thick caramel malt, honey, grape wine fruitiness, tobacco, deep toasted oak, peppery herbal spice, dark vanilla. It's incredible how sweet and fruity this is yet how much rich malt it retains. Lots of nice oak flavor in here too. Nothing overwhelms so it just stays very complex and balanced overall.

**Finish:** This stuff was already fantastic but the finish is epic. Huge fruity sweetness builds brightly and just keeps coming along with rich malt, toffee, chocolate, and mouth-tingling spice. The sweetness and mouth-numbing spice linger for a long time.

*****

Don't know what else I can say, fantastic stuff. Dark, sweet, oaky and malty, fun stuff from top to bottom. I just passed up a sherried Bunna 12yr from Signatory, I really wish I had tried this first and then I might have grabbed it.

I‚Äôm upset first off that I did not buy more of these, and further upset that I traded one (back when it was kosher) to someone who immediately reswapped it for something not at all worthy. 

I miss this bottling. It was amazing. I don‚Äôt know we‚Äôll ever see something like this again but I continue to hunt.
Sounds amazing, first fill bunnahabhains can be incredible - thanks for sharing another mouthwatering review!!
fantastic review, one of my favorite drams of all time. wish I had more of this stuff.
Great review. This was a great one. I bought one as soon as I saw it. After trying it I  went back and picked up a second one. So good and very reasonably priced. I have just a little left in that 2nd bottle. That 12 is still available.
Sounds amazing. I just tried the 12 year for the first time a couple weeks back and wish I had tried it much sooner.
Sounds de-lish.
I think this is my first cask strength (unpeated) Bunna, and I will definitely be on the lookout for more too. Do you remember what your buddy traded his bottle for?
I was talking about the signatory 1st fill sherry from FineDrams, yeah it's still there. I did my order already for the r/Scotch bottles, and I forgot to throw it on. Now I kinda want to do another lol...
Definitely keep your eyes peeled. The next best thing I‚Äôve had from them was OB Bunna 14yr PX. 

I‚Äôm repressing the memories.
That‚Äôs the one I thought you mentioned. I do see that they still have it. I‚Äôm starting to realize this hobby is a very deep rabbit hole.  I‚Äôll be looking at FineDrams and think ‚Äú I‚Äôd like that 12 year old Bunny and that 22 year old Arran and that 23 year old Clynelish and that CS Ben Nevis and, hmmm, and that 1991 Balblair too. Too many really good bottles out there and not enough cash. And samples are nice but I want a bottle I can slowly work thru and of course, overindulge a bit. First world problems I guess. This is not counting The Whisky Barrel. They have the flora and fauna Dailuaine and the 10 year old Ben Nevis, both very reasonably priced. Damn, Binny‚Äôs better not get anything good in, either. I‚Äôll let you know if I pull the trigger on anything. Cheers"
"Review #110, Ledaig 7yr r/Scotch selection",,https://i.redd.it/l4ei29qrsdx31.jpg,"I thought it was a good time to crack this open given the recent release of the 2 new r/Scotch bottles. This was the very first community barrel pick from about 5 years ago, which was before my time but I was able to try it courtesy of the always generous u/nsquare14

*****

**Ledaig 7yr ""peated sherry cask,"" 59.2%**

**Nose:** Intense yet very clean and medicinal peat, ashy char, rich chocolate, burnt rubber, mean briny peat, burnt sticky caramel, orange citrus zest, tons of sweet vanilla, some exotic spice. Peat, peat and more peat, but lots of sweet and oaky complexity as well. This nose is fucking amazing.

**Taste:** Rich luxurious caramel, intense medicinal peat, tons of vanilla, mouth numbing peat and menthol, toasted chocolatey oak, lemon, fruity zing, ashy char. There's some tart fruity and winey sherry sweetness but it can't overtake all the intense peat, ends up being a nice balance with the scales tipped further towards ""peat monster."" Delicious from top to bottom.  

**Finish:** Builds to some bright tart fruit, mean peat, mouth-numbing menthol and ashy char. Beautiful textbook example of a proper ashy and peaty finish.

*****

This is definitely not your average ""slightly smoky"" or ""sweet peat"" Scotch for the faint of heart, it is a complete peat monster. The sherry influence isn't huge to me, but it adds some nice complexity and sweetness I think. I thought maybe they would have picked something more accessible for a community bottle, but I'm not complaining at all. This is fantastic and totally appeals to my insatiable peat lust.

Good timing with the more recent picks arriving for a lot of people! I'm sad this one was before me as well, your review makes it sounds amazing. I'd love to see another funky peat bomb get picked in the future. 

Did you get the two new picks?
Yeah I got both new picks, really excited about it. Don't think I'll be opening the Ardmore yet since I already have an Exclusive Malts 11yr open right now. But I'm super curious about the Wardhead. You?
Yessir. I consider myself an Ardmore fan but after trying a teaspooned 21 year old Glenfiddich from K&L, I might actually be more excited about that one. Either way, I think both will be opened immediately.
Did you get anything else? I'd be curious to know what bottles you grabbed. I got an Octo 8.2 ($130!), Port Charlotte CC:01, Loch Lomond 17 CS, Ben Nevis 10 CS batch 001, and the Armagnac Reddit pick.
Those were basically all the ones I was debating getting too. I've seen some good reviews for that Loch Lomond, very curious about it. I ended up not getting anything else, because I'd also just ordered North Star Vega 22 and Sirius 31 from The Whisky Exchange the day before, plus I got slammed by the tariffs on Scotch Whisky Auctions. I'm regretting not getting an Octomore though.
Those blends are interesting, I'm not familiar with the brand. They look good but I'm not sure about that low ABV. In my experience 43% can go either way, it can be too light but can also shine through decently.
I feel the same. They're both at least actually cask strength, so I am hoping that will keep them from feeling too weak."

*****

**Dalmore Port Wood Reserve, 46.5%**

**Nose:** It's challenging and interesting right off the bat with thick caramel and chocolate, tannic oak, tart fruit, a rich and robust wine funk and tartness that I usually associate more with sherry, baking spices, cinnamon, nice thick malt.

**Taste:** Rich oozing malt with a warmly smooth wine layer, then a pop of tart berry fruitiness, tannic oak and tobacco, before melting into smoother chocolate and warm fruit. It's complex but very smooth and cohesive. Nice stuff. Maybe I'm just not familiar with Port, but this still has a funk(the good kind) and tartness that reminds me more of sherry. Might just be a wine thing here, it's good either way.

**Finish:** Darkly sweet and tannic on the finish with charred oak, tobacco, dark fruits, burnt caramel, but still plenty of rich caramel maltiness

*****

Not quite what I was expecting from Dalmore. I've only ever had their standard 12yr and was completely unimpressed, it tasted like a lesson in how *not* to Sherry a Scotch. I was expecting a light and uneventful ""easy-sipper"" that would let them slap Port on the label and charge more money. But this stuff is luxurious and dark, and has some complex and interesting flavors. Not what I'm used to from a Ported Scotch either, lots of tart fruits and wine funk that I usually associate with sherry. Very nice mouthfeel at 46.5% as well (kind of an odd ABV, but I'll take it).

I received a bottle of this for Christmas last year and really enjoyed it! I think if this was in the $50-$65(like Quinta ruban) range for me it‚Äôd be a staple. 

It‚Äôs just a bit too expensive for me to drink/buy regularly though.
right on, I was very surprised when I sampled this one too.  Not at like Dalmore to release a full flavored product.
This sounds really good, great review. I‚Äôve never had a Dalmore as the reviews have always been a bit, meh. Is this one you would buy?
> 46.5%

An OB Dalmore bottled more than 40%? Wow.
If I remember correctly I asked to add it kinda late. I wasn't interested in a Dalmore until I noticed it was 46%, and that along with the fact that I love Ported Scotch got me curious. 

I tend to enjoy non-peated Port more than peated, and this was no exception.
At the $80-$100 that I think it goes for, no. I wouldn't say it is quite must-try level, it's just interesting to try such a good quality Dalmore.
Right? It was a good sign in my eyes, and it ended up paying off.
All right then, I‚Äôll take a pass but will look for it to try sometime. How‚Äôs that SCN, Ledaig 13 coming along? Still loving it? I‚Äôm itching to buy something.
Yeah it's a pretty epic bottle, I keep liking it more and more. Such a mean peat monster, and the sherry influence is just superb. Really well done stuff, I can tell its gonna be a good winter bottle. 

Might be a good scotch day for me today. Winds and fire danger are bad, they shut off power to my whole town. No work today, but no electricity til possibly midnight
Yikes, keep that scotch safe! That‚Äôs just really crazy stuff with the fires and no power. On the other hand, does your scotch taste smokier? Had to ask but that‚Äôs no joking matter. That sounds scary as hell. Are there fires near you?
I‚Äôll pick up a bottle of the Ledaig.
Haha no prob. The biggest fire is way up by the bay area, but theres a couple big fires down south by LA that are about 1-1.5 hours away. We get some days that are smoky depending on the wind, but the dangerous stuff today is dry desert winds from the east so it's clear at least.

There was actually a fire that flared up just outside of town today, a guys generator started it. It quickly burnt his house down and started a wildfire because of the winds. It was bad enough that evacuation orders were given for 285 people. But there was instantly a ton of firefighters and air support on it, and they squashed it. Theres 3 or 4 big fires in California, but you dont hear about all the ones like this that they quickly get under control. I think I read that there have been about 350 fires put out in the last couple days.

Also I dont think you'll be disappointed in that ledaig
That‚Äôs just frightening and no power would just add to the uneasiness. Could a smallish fire like the one near you explode into a huge fire in a very short amount of time? Is this the ‚Äúseason‚Äù or time of the year you‚Äôre prone to fires like this? 

Looking forward to the Ledaig. Keep safe.
We regularly go all summer with no rain, so everything is just super dry. It's pretty much fire season all summer long until it gets wet and cold again. But its extra bad right now because of the seasonal santa ana winds. They are super strong and dry winds. 5-10% humidity, 50mph winds here but some places are as high as 70-80mph. So any little fire can just explode and get out of control really fast. For example, a new fire broke out in simi valley by L.A. this morning. Its burned 1300 acres and theres basically no containment. Theres so much dense dry vegetation, and the strong dry wind just push it so fast and so erratically, they cant effectively fight it. They basically just make everyone in it's possible path evacuate and do their best to keep it away from neighborhoods/structures. They'll be able to fight it better after this wind event calms down, but it still might be days or weeks before its completely out. And that's just one fire, theres 2 more big ones in the L.A. area and the worst is the kincade fire up north.

So I imagine that's why they called a tanker plane, helicopter, and tons of firemen onto a housefire/brushfire this morning in my neck of the woods. I'm in a rural fire prone area and they dont need more incidents lol. 

Sorry for the wall of text on these, just thought you might appreciate some local perspective.
No worries on the wall of text - great read. Here in the soggy Midwest it‚Äôs hard to grasp the dryness and the hot wind. I‚Äôve seen some of the fore‚Äôs on the news, just crazy. I heard this morning there was a new one just north of LA.
Heres a good idea of the flora in SoCal, it's called scrub brush or chaparral.

It's very dense and very dry, because really socal is practically a desert climate-wise. And there's vast areas of steep, rugged mountains covered in this stuff. Mixed with powerful dry winds it just takes off. People and communities tend to build further and further out into this wilderness, and so homes become threatened.
Well, that explains that."
"Review #110, Bulleit Bourbon",,https://i.redd.it/fhthm4jiq6v31.jpg,"A very ubiquitous ~~MGP-sourced Bourbon~~(bottle actually says ""Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey,"" and a commenter informed me it's actually Four Roses distilled), I've had it plenty of times but never actually sat down to review it. I wanted to get some for the Community review, and luckily I found this cool little 375ml bottle for $16 just in the nick of time. Thank you for the reminder u/signde

*****

**Bulleit Bourbon, 45%**

**Nose:** Very fruity and sweet, with a friendly yet stout Bourbon warmth to it. Hot cherry and green apple, tons of cinnamon and baking spices, smooth and sweet toasted wood, slightly musty, tobacco, vanilla, light friendly char, metallic copper caramel. 

**Taste:** Smooth and warm with nice flavor. Pleasant cherry fruitiness, Bourbon warmth, clean coppery caramel, maple, nice zingy clove spice, light tobacco and smooth toasted wood, some mild heat to give it the slightest kick. It has a whole lot of quintessential ""Bourbon"" flavor and even touches on some darker richly toasted notes, but overall it delivers in a very smooth and inoffensive way. It's fun to sip on and that's all that really matters.

**Finish:** Vanilla, darker caramel, smooth musty wood. Nothing spectacular but continues with the expected smooth and toasted sweetness

This is delicious stuff, the only real ""flaws"" it has are related to it being kind of light at the low ABV. But they don't all need to be Barrel proof bruisers, and this stuff accomplishes what it sets out to do beautifully IMO. As good of a light and easy sipper as you could hope for, and probably a great starter Bourbon.

I‚Äôve been considering the Bulleit 10yr until I saw it wasn‚Äôt much difference then regular Bulleit.

Have you had the 10yr?
As a beginner bourbon drinker I found this review quite helpful. Thanks for sharing!
I like it.
Enjoyed the review. You state MGP sourced but the label is KSBW. The rye is MGP but I believe the bourbon is Four Roses.
Its my basic bourbon for mixed drinks.
I will never drink Bulleit again. The kicked their daughter out of the business for being gay. And the father sexually and physically abused her growing up.

I enjoy this review, my only note - you state the only downside is the low ABV, yet the score was a 5? While I don't necessarily disagree with the score, it may be worthwhile to let others know what it did wrong to get a 5. Just my two cents.
I have that same exact picture, got it from a friend. Do you know anything about it? I've been curious about the history of the ad/image.
Very strange how subjective ratings work. I could have written your review almost word-for-word...I agree with all of it. But when it came time to award the numeric score I probably would have gone with **7**.
Bulleit is one of my favs. And I love the ten year too for special occasions.
Bourbon for drinking. Nothing fancy. Always good to have a bottle on hand.

Makes great Manhattans
I didn't like this one - maybe good as aftershave? (OK kidding)  I mean, it wasn't awful, but I couldn't find anything particularly good or interesting about it, just ""dry"", lacking depth and sweetness that I like in Bourbon.  (My favorite Whiskeys are heavily peated + sherry aged Scotches, Japanese whiskeys, or American Bourbons with more interesting complexity).

I didn't get any fruity/carmel etc. notes when I tried it - I guess I'll try it again next time a friend has it.

Bourbon's I'd rather have: Ezra Brooks 90, Evan Williams BiB 11.  

Bourbons/Whiskeys I liked a \*lot\* more: Old Forrester 100, Old Ezra 101, some Eagle Rare I had a few years ago (recent bottle seems just ""OK""), Balvenie DoubleWood, Ardbeg Uigeadail, Hibiki, Suntory Burai Ha.
If this is whiskey review #110 I hope you started at the top and are working the way down, don‚Äôt get me wrong I enjoy Bulleit but it‚Äôs a common bourbon to review.
I really like the 10-year, but I should mention I also like the basic Bulleit more than this reviewer. I'd give basic Bulleit a 6 or 6.5, and the 10-year a 7 or 7.5, probably. I really enjoy the citrus and spice kick a lot, and the 10-year seemed to me like the same only more of it. The only reservation I have about Bulleit 10-year is that I think there are marginally better options at that price point.
I like the 10yr, but I dont recall it being that much better. It's similar in price luckily, so definitely worth checking out if you like the standard. I haven't had the barrel proof, I'm curious about that too.
Good deal, and thanks for reading. Their rye was one of my first whiskey loves, highly recommend that stuff as well.
Cheers and Happy Cake Day!
Oh geez, you're right. I changed it, but I wish I had looked more closely at your comment earlier. Has it always been Kentucky distilled? Because I didn't use to enjoy this stuff nearly as much, but I just chalked it up to changing tastes or quality. And Four Roses just happens to be one of my absolute favorite Bourbons, I love the Private Selects.
Seconding RareBird101, I enjoyed the review as well and thought the same thing. The bourbon is Four Roses sourced and will transition to start using Diageo's Shelbyville, KY Bulleit Distillery distillate when it comes of age in a few years. Shelbyville started producing in 2017 but didn't ramp up fully until 2018/early 2019 if I'm not mistaken. The rye is the classic MGP 95% rye mash bill like most people know.
Jim Beam Black ;)
Joining with the others to say that I drank the regular and the rye almost exclusively until I was made aware of this. Certainly not judging anyone who wants to keep drinking it but there are many other comparable options out there that don‚Äôt come with this attitude.
I enjoyed Bulleit. It was a nice treat instead of Beam. But I stopped because of this.
Well I just bought a bottle this weekend and now I feel like an asshole.
Apparently Bulleit just came out with their side of the story. I always like to hear both sides. Not telling you what to believe but look it up.
Yeah it's funny how tastes can change. You might try this again someday and remember why you loved it so much, and keep coming back. I actually seem to like it more now than when I first had it.
No problem. Scoring is always hard for me, it's usually kind of an afterthought for me and then I have trouble deciding on something. But yeah I maybe could have gone with a 6 on this one. Honestly I'm kind of a proof whore, and the low ABV usually hurts something like this a lot for me.

In my mind on this scale anywhere between 5-10 is a good score. So its on the bottom end of a good whiskey, but still a good whiskey.
Yeah, scoring is hard. I've had lots of really good stuff, so maybe I'm just a little jaded at this point as well haha.
I wasn't really crazy about this stuff for a long time either, like you said it always seemed really dry and kind of boring. But I had it recently and really enjoyed it, and then I seemed to enjoy it a lot last night for the review. Cant really explain it, maybe the quality has gone up or maybe my tastes have changed.
I tend to review more ""spectacular"" whiskies, I'm just more inspired when I enjoy them a lot more. I mainly reviewed this for the community review, but I'm glad I did because I enjoy it a lot more than I remember.
If that's what you like go for it.
We'll put. I appreciate your wisdom.
Bingo. Hit the nail on the head friend.
Don't feel like an ass hole. You didn't know. You know now though. So finish the bottle and enjoy it. You can't be held responsible for things you weren't aware. It's a good bourbon I'll admit for sure, I just won't be giving any money back to the company.
Completely agree with you. 

You have a good source I can read???
That's fair! Have you tried the Bulleit Barrel Strength? I've yet to pull the trigger (pun intended) on it.
Yes, I totally agree.  That's one reason why I tried to be clear that I'm not trying to say it's a bad bourbon, just that for me, when I tried it, it was missing the things that I'd want. 

It's sad how people downvote because they don't like your opinion, even after you go back and make effort to write a quality comment rather than just a low effort ""this sucks"" or the like. 

üòø
I meant no offense, like I said just seemed like an odd one to review. I would assume most folks on this reddit wouldve had it already especially at its price point and popularity at bars.  Forgetting things on bourbon is a hobby of mine! Thanks for the review, sorry if I came off rude.
I'm in the same boat. I have heard they have since made up. But still, there are plenty of better options.
It‚Äôs a long read!

[Bulleit Legacy On The Line ](https://www.gobourbon.com/bulleit-legacy-on-the-line/)
No offense taken, I'm not one of the ones downvoting you. Yeah you would think reviews would start with more standard stuff like this one, and then work your way up to better stuff. But it just didn't work like that for me, it was really fantastic stuff that inspired me to review in the first place. And now I sometimes come back around to more basic bottlings that I've been drinking for years.
Exactly!!!!

**Nose:** Crisp and clean Rye nose with sharp pine, huge mint, peppery spice, caramel, green apple, sweet vanilla, big sweet wood char. Leaves the nose with a minty tingle, definitely not gonna confuse this one with a Bourbon.

**Taste:** Rich toffee that is absolutely drenched in sweet, bright minty rye and peppery spice. A pop of sweet cherry and green apple, hot cinnamon, sweet wood char. It's a simple and direct kind of bare-bones Rye goodness, but it does it extremely well with big clean flavor. And I cannot overstate how saturated this is with minty Rye goodness.

**Finish:** Tons and tons of minty Rye with big burnt caramel and sweet wood char, just delicious.

*****

This is classic WhistlePig deliciousness. I've had picks that are spicier, or creamier, or richer, more of a distinct personality. But this just hits all the Rye marks I look for and it hits them so well. As a Rye lover it's like an arrow that strikes the bullseye, even if it does it with a little less flourish than others have. It's the kind of Rye I would let someone try, just to say that *this* is what a Rye is supposed to taste like.

Nice review! As a rye lover, I really need to find a few of these picks to grab.
Saw this at the store and was on the fence.. They have a ton of whistlepig picks. I think I read on their sign in-store they're Alberta ryes.   
How do you feel about this bottle compared to say, a WFE 4 year rye? I've never tried either and the WFE seems well liked so I was thinking of trying that first, though this sounds up my alley.
Local shop around here has a 10 and 12 store pick on the way. Can‚Äôt wait for them to drop. Never tried any WP before but I love rye and store picks seem to be the way to go.
I have all of them but the 15 year just tried the 6 year and I love it
I could instantly tell by the picture that this was Canadian distillate inside, but like you said, nothing wrong with that! You nailed what it meant to love a rye like this: it's all rye, all the time. You're not going to confuse it with anything else. But since it's so well aged, it's not going to chase you off with young, astringent or bitter notes. A Canadian rye (Barrell; my flair tag) was the one that finally opened the door for me into the world of ryes and this one sounds like it would've done the same for me too! Well written review!
Nice review! My dad has a bottle from the same batch, I‚Äôll enjoy doing a comparison to see if my sentiments are similar.
Thanks, yeah I recommend it. You're in oregon right? Do they not ship to you?
They had a few 13 year MGP's but all the picks they have now are Alberta. Nothing wrong with that though, still some of the best rye out there imo. 

As far as how it compares to WFE 4yr, I think that's just personal preference. I'm kind of a Rye fiend, and the 100% mashbill and age on these WP picks satisfies me like few others do. But the Willett is also really good stuff, and many might not like the WP that much more to warrant the higher price. Definitely start with the Willett before jumping into a WP that is almost double the price.
The WFE 4 just has that overpowering spearmint menthol note I can‚Äôt shake. It‚Äôs waaay too bold and I taste it in their WFE Bourbon and Noah‚Äôs mill (that they distill) guessing it‚Äôs a high rye. That being said, the new 6yr K&L SiB rye does not have that insane note.. I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs only because of the 2 additional years. If you‚Äôre looking at the WFE 4yr rye for around $50, I would personally just get a Pikesville at around 6yrs and 100proof I believe. Much better in my opinion.
Thanks for reading dude. Yeah it's a shame, theres really not much on the market for a decent rye assault. It's pretty much these and MGP. I just try to to grab whatever WP picks and weird MGP releases I can find. Ive been in hog heaven(pun intended) with K&L's recent wave of MGP and Alberta picks.

Also, how could you tell this was Alberta from the pic? Because it wasn't one of the ""swine merchant"" bottles?
Yea, I am in Oregon and it looks like they do ship to me... Decisions now need to be made.
Have you had the 12 yr Lot 40 Cask Strength? If so, how would you compare these WhistlePig picks?
I have their 13 yr MGP and it is divine.
To me: if it's close to straw color: Alberta.  If it's a deep brown color: MGP. There's only been one instance where that didn't match up, but thankfully the Total Wine Rep let me taste test them and we were both surprised to get Alberta notes on a darker single Barrel pick
I have a bottle of the 11yr Lot 40 open right now, I would maybe do a little sbs for you if I wasn't plugged up from allergies :(

From what I recall the Lot 40 is richer and more polished, this WP in more bright and minty sweet, more lively in general. 

I reviewed 2 different Lot 40's before:

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/89vx6y/review_10_lot_40_cask_strength/

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/c601dn/review_15_lot_40_cask_strength_11yr_2nd_edition/
Which one, what's the proof? They had 3.
With Scotch color can be telling, but I don't pay attention to color much with American(or in this case Canadian) Whiskey. 

Whistle Pig gets finished in used Bourbon barrels right? Is it universal with all their Whiskey, both Alberta and MGP? Because that might effect color. I wonder how long of a finish it gets too. It's pry one of those things that we'll never get a straight answer about from them anyway.
Damn! I guess they don‚Äôt ship liquor to Oregon.
I have the 117, 119 and 114 MGP‚Äôs. I haven‚Äôt popped the 117 yet but man the 119 and 114 are exceptional. I think the 114 is the best of those 2 for sure.
I messaged you over on WN about it
How funny, I went through all 3 and the 114 is probably my least favorite. Different strokes I guess! I went back and forth on whether I liked the 117 or 119 more, I think the 119 might have won out but narrowly. They're both fantastic.

Actually I still have a 114 open, maybe I'll give it another go today.
The problem I had was a side by side because the added proof tends to shine, especially if I come back to a lower proof. I felt the 114 was much more rounded but I‚Äôm literally comparing two of some of the better ryes I‚Äôve ever had. I have a strong preference for MGP to begin with so It‚Äôs a tough call and might depend on the day to be fair.
Yeah I'm a big fan of MGP Rye also, and all 3 are really good. So in the end the comparisons are for fun and kind of splitting hairs. 

I'm drinking the 114 right now, and there's just a lot of really hot cinnamon. The 119 was a little more well rounded(but still fierce) and the 117 was a minty Rye bomb. I will say that air/time and adding some water helps the 114 a lot, I definitely like it more than when I first reviewed it. And I'm getting more tasty dill on it now which is nice.

I really love how different these 3 are from each other, considering they are from the same distillation and aging conditions.

EDIT: ok I'm still sipping on the 114, this stuff is really fucking good. I dont want all my words to obfuscate that fact
Hahaha man I agree, I actually get a little less dill than the 119, from what I remember. I‚Äôll have to come back to them again to reconsider. They‚Äôre all so damn good, even stand up to the SAOS 10 BP rye I have. In some ways they‚Äôre better, in others not as much.
When you say 114, are you by chance rounding up on the 113.9? I picked that bottle up a couple weeks ago while in town for VMWorld.
Hey there, no it‚Äôs actually 114.5. The 113.9 was Alberta juice I believe and a later arrival by a few weeks I believe?
Do you know the age of the 113.9?
They state that it‚Äôs older than 13 years, could be closer to 13.5 but not 100% sure. I think when I read it they claimed bottled sometime in the fall so it wasn‚Äôt too specific."

"Review #108, Weller Antique 107 (done blind)",,https://i.redd.it/38guun2qbvi31.jpg,"This was drank blind as a mystery sample, it's mystery #9 of 9.

*****

**Weller Antique 107, 53.5% (done blind)**

**Nose:** Big woody oak, leather, lightly tannic, subtle dark cherry fruit, chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon burn. It's nice and oaky but a bit too light and dull

**Taste:** Dull kind of ""general Bourbony"" flavor of hot cherry syrup, caramel, vanilla, builds to a brash hot cinnamon spice. Starts off ok but a little dull, builds to an overly hot and unbalanced spice.

**Finish:** Sweet caramel and hot cherry syrup with some peppery spice.

* It's not outright bad, but it ranges from being dull to unbalanced and hot. Air time did help this out a lot, last half of the glass was a little better with some nice mild oaky sweetness. Tastes like it's somewhere between a hot 45% and a dull 50%. My guess is maybe Blantons?

Score: **4**, but **5** after some decent air time

*****

**Post reveal thoughts:** Nooooo! I'm a big fan of Wheaters, and I am always professing my love for this stuff! It's been a while since I had any though, I've actually yet to try it since they switched the bottle design. Has the stuff gone downhill in the last few years? Have my tastes just evolved? Both? Also, I'm usually pretty good at guessing Wheaters blind, but the only familiar thing I see here is a vague kind of general sweetness and that cinnamon flavor that I remember well. It's missing that creamy butterscotch that I used to love, maybe that's what I picked up as vanilla. I need to try more I think.

Off topic but I really like that poster in the background
I appreciate you doing this one blind. Sounds like you learned something about your evolving pallet! I'd be curious to hear what you daily wheater sippers are.
Was expecting this to be a rye.
I get all your notes except I don't find it to be hot at all. Really like it for MSRP. Would be a regular buy from me if I could always find it at MSRP.  
Did you eat or drink something before this?
I‚Äôm not sure when the last time you had it was, but I think OWA has gotten better over the last three or four years.
Honestly, I'm not sure if my palate has changed or in making more OWA the quality has dropped. We've done single picks of this and it's just average to be honest.
Hot cinnamon.  That's pretty much it for this stuff for me.  So one note and totally lacking in the caramel-vanilla notes I most love in bourbon.
Looks like a classic Guinness poster by design but I'm probably wrong. The bottle the monkey is drinking is obviously not a Guinness.
Thanks for reading, and yeah blind tastings are fun. 

I don't really have ""daily wheater sippers,"" I just kind of take what I can get. I used to like Maker's 46 and Larceny but it's been a while, I like all the Weller I've tried(especially a couple store picks), ORVW, Rebel Yell SiB.
I wouldn't have thought of this stuff as overly hot or unpleasant either. In the past I've really liked it. But that's the fun of blind samples, you drink it without any preconceptions. My friend I got it from says he likes to give it out as a mystery because people routinely score it lower than they otherwise would. 

I actually drank this about a week ago and forgot to post it, so I don't remember the exact conditions. But I usually don't drink and review if my palate is compromised from weird food or allergies or anything.
Last time I had it was before they changed the bottle style, but that would probably still be in that time frame
Hell we've done wheater blinds, and 107 was almost always dead last with friends, or 1 place ahead of last. To me its always had that off putting red hot cinnamon candy taste but in that artifical way, which is nasty vs the cinnamon spice pulled off by other bottles way better, hell even Pure KY pulls it off much better. I guess some people like that weird artifical like spice of OWA. Same for picks, I had 1, and buddy had store pick, blahhh. Don't know why people rave about the picks, wasn't much different than reg bottle sure as fuck not worth the price or hassle.
Ahh. I knew I‚Äôd seen it before
Love blind tastings. Makes me reevaluate and stay humble to the mantra ""drink what you like"" and skip the hype.
I seem to remember it having a much thicker viscosity and more mouthfeel 7-8 yrs ago. Now it seems thin ever at 107. Once the baby pappy got rolling the demand went up and quality down imo. I tried a Weller 12 a couple months ago and it was totally disjointed. The problem or maybe challenge with BT picks is they rarely offer you anything that's off profile. They all taste almost identical to their shelf offerings.
Not a fan of W12 either but if I'd have to choose between the two, I'd take W12 over OWA any day. But it wasn't untill Makers Cask that changed my opinion on wheated bottles (just not a fan in general), and subsequently Rebell SiB which is excellent as well. Rebell SiB is so overlooked.

Weird that in this day and age there is still a dearth of wheaters, or I should say good wheaters (and available) in this market. Sure you have stuff like 1792 Sweet Wheat, but that's even more scarce than 12/OWA.
I like more of the Barton's products than the BT. Agree 100% on Rebel Yell 10yr. It was a go to when you could get it. I started off really liking wheaters but now find myself gravitating to more Ryes and high rye mashbills."

*****

**Ledaig 13 Single Cask Nation, 2005/2019, 2nd fill sherry butt, cask #900165, 57.1%**

**Nose:** Rich, dark, and peaty, nose on this stuff is delicious. Huge Laphroaig-like medicinal peat and rich vanilla, chocolate, fruity sweetness, brine, rich wood, ashy and peaty char. 

**Taste:**  Explodes with dark fruity sweetness and charred peat, rich caramel and malt, sweet vanilla, light briny smoke, cherry, gritty toasted wood, some brighter lemon and vanilla

**Finish:** Builds to a long and peaty finish of dark cherry fruits, wood char, vanilla and medicinal peat that leaves the mouth numb and peaty for ages

*****

This is beautiful stuff, it has huge flavor that is amazingly polished and balanced. It's a peat bomb, and drinking it blind I might have even guessed it as a Laphroaig due to all the medicinal peat and vanilla. The sherry influence is not obvious or super strong to me, it's more of a dark and sweet fruitiness that smoothly compliments the fiercely peaty Scotch. That is the way I like my sherry though, so I tend to prefer these 2nd fill barrels and this one is exactly what I had hoped for.

This sounded so good from your review, I went out this morning and picked one up. Looking forward to checking it out soon!

EDIT: okay, so I like this bottle. I really like it and it is fabulous - what a lovely balance of sherry, peat, and earth. It strikes me as a rebalanced Ardbeg Oogy where the slate/mineral notes are removed, salt is dialed down, but the earthy peat and sherry is dialed up a little more (but not to the level of ‚Äújuicy‚Äù sherry). I didn‚Äôt get quite the medicinal blast of a Laphroaig, but I‚Äôm glad about that as I love Ledaig‚Äôs profile. What a great dram! It doesn‚Äôt have the first sip ‚ÄúWOW! Buy another one right now!‚Äù factor that I felt with Port Charlotte MRC 01 or Bowmore Devil‚Äôs Cask Batch 2, but it is really, really close. I may buy the other bottle that I know is out there but I‚Äôm not sure yet. Really lovely stuff for sure and I am super happy with this purchase. Now I am even more excited to crack open my Ledaig 19s (PX and Marsala)

EDIT 2: 9/14/19 I just did a comparison of this bottle vs Bowmore 10 Devil‚Äôs Cask and Port Charlotte MRC 01: 2010 and it totally held its own, especially with water...holy cow!! Bought a second bottle immediately. The Ledaig 19s are in a league of their own, but this SCN Ledaig 13 is stunning.
Great review, thanks.  I've been equivocating about picking this one up. Now it's off to Binny's in Skokie tomorrow where it looks as though it's in stock.
Great review, thank you! There is a store by me that has a SCN Ledaig 15 but it is first fill bourbon barrel so I‚Äôm not sure if I would like it as much since I love the sherry notes.
Aw man, this sounds delicious. Great review.
I'm drooling - that sounds fantastic. Don't think I'll be finding one around here though.
I love the stuff these guys bottle.  This one was very tasty!
Thanks again for your review. I picked a bottle up yesterday, and it's sublime. An instant favorite. Your notes are spot on and it has a very nice, thick mouth feel.
Did you end up with a bottle of the 15 as well?
Just cracked my bottle, I'm already tempted to buy a 2nd. This is great stuff!
Sounds great. Thanks for the review. I picked up a bottle of this and can't wait to crack it.
Think the Ledaig 15 worth for $135? Thanks!
Glad I could help you with your...um, equivocating
Are you sure it's first fill? I have the newest retail SCN ledaig 15 and it is refill and amazing. I had it side by side with the 13 and preferred the 15 hands down (each to their own though obviously). I am shite at tasting notes or I would have posted some.
Did you ever end up picking this up? How much was it?
No, I got this and the Clynelish 9yr Bourbon barrel. Haven't opened that one yet.
Cheers, glad you're enjoying it!
I knew I wanted a SCN bottle with these new releases, and I really tried to do my research and pick the right one. IB's are always a gamble, but after opening this I feel like I got the right one. I think you'll like it if you love peat.
I've only had one SCN bottling and I was not impressed. But I usually enjoy Ledaig and was being tempted by this. Sorry for the big word.
Touch√©, it is a refill bourbon Ledaig 15; I was confused with the SCN Clynelish 9 FF bourbon cask I was eyeing too. Now I am curious about the SCN Ledaig 15 from your experience, though I just got the Ledaig 19 PX and Marsala finishes so that is a lot of Ledaig...great problem to have though.
I haven‚Äôt picked it up though I still see it for $145. I did pick up a second bottle of the Ledaig 13 sherry cask for $135 because it was incredible - I have been on a peat/sweet kick lately so that‚Äôs been my jam over the straight peat profile.
I'm a bit Ledaig + Sherry homer...sounds like this will not disappoint.
> Sorry for the big word.

Try to up-smart me on my own post will you! That's a new word for me is all, I'm just giving you shit
I‚Äôm debating to get 13 or 15. The 15 is $135 so may pick it up tonight hehe
I‚Äôd love to get your thoughts on whatever bottle you get.the 13 was crazy good and I am curious to hear how the 15 would compare - I don‚Äôt think you will be disappointed either way."
"Review #107, Old Pulteney 12",,https://i.redd.it/fpa5a3cf6gi31.jpg,"**Old Pulteney 12, 43%**

**Nose:** A smooth wave of rich caramel malt and sea brine, vanilla, rich fruits, lemon citrus, green apple, pastry, salted caramel

**taste:** Lightly rich caramel malt and briny sea salt, light vanilla, toffee, sweet pastry, smoothly bright lemon zest, salted caramel. Nice flavor and a friendly kind of richness with the low ABV

**Finish:** Sweet pastry and vanilla with lingering salted caramel

*****

This is just a delightfully pleasant little malty Scotch, it was one of my early single malt loves and I never stopped enjoying it. And that salty hint of sea air is just so satisfying and well integrated, like a friendlier version of the fierce and boggy brine I often find in Islay and Campbeltown Scotches. It reminds me that they don't all have to be a hugely rich Cask Strength assault on the senses, sometimes its nice to just sip on something light and smooth. And this stuff does it so well.

Great review. This sound like a good one to pick up and a bargain to boot.
This is the only single malt i've tried thus far, and I enjoy it. Curious how this compares to more expensive bottles, and how fits into the scotch category in general? Is this considered peaty, or smoky? I don't know how to recognize those notes yet.
Still need to give this one a try. Thanks for the review.
Love this stuff for the price point. $39 where I'm at.

A very easy drinking and delicious dram. Like salted caramel in a glass.
Easily one of the best values in the States right now. There aren‚Äôt too many single malts you can find for $40 or less, let alone ones with age statements.
‚Äú*It reminds me that they don't all have to be a hugely rich Cask Strength assault on the senses, sometimes its nice to just sip on something light and smooth.*‚Äù 

Amen. I can really appreciate that sentiment. As much as I love a *hugely rich Cask Strength assault on the senses* scotch. A nice mellow dram can really hit the spot, too. I also happen to agree with your notes on the Old Pulteney. I just finished a sample the other night and took my notes. I thought it did nice, light, sweet and briney really well. Reminded me of JW Green Label, especially that smooth drinkability.
For some reason I have had a hankering for this. Haven't had a bottle in years. Might buy it now after reading this review.
Have you never had it? It's actually kind of divisive, there's lots of people around here that really dont like it which I never understood
It's not smoky at all, and theres little or no sherry influence which is another major player in scotch styles. This is a straight forward malty scotch, and a great place to start. The main thing you'll get with some better scotches is an increase in ABV. 40% is the bare minimum to call it scotch, the 43% this is bottled at is better but still a little light. 46% is where you start to get into real quality stuff.
You should pick up the 43% version soon.  The new rebranded OP12 is the same 40% version in the US also.
Agreed, the price has managed to stay low for some time now too. I'm worried it will go up with the recent redesign, but I don't know anything for sure
I've never had it. I guess why I've never picked one up is because of all the archieved reviews. It seems like more people dislike it or it's rather ""meh"" vs. reviews like yours.  Like u/CocktailChemist mentioned above, I wish they still offered the 2 pack of the 12 and the 17. I remember it being pretty reasonable, like around $30 ¬±.  Oh well, the 12 is about $40 at Binny's - it's on the list.
Thanks. Do you know of either smoky or sherry-influenced bottles around the same price point as the OP12?
Ouch. Thanks for the tip.
What I miss was when they sold a set of half bottles of the 12 and 17 Year. The only way it could have been better is if they had made it a 3x200 mL set with the 21.
I may really be the odd one out by preferring the 12 Year over the old 17 Year because I liked the reduced sherry influence.
For smoke try some Johnnie Walker black label(for the love of god stay away from the red label). If you wanna go up to some better stuff try Laphroaig or Ardbeg. To try some sherry look for macallan or balvenie. If you wanna try some more malty scotch try some glenlivet, glenfiddich, or glenmorangie

Some of these run a little more than the old pulteney depending on your area, but most of these can be found at bars if you just wanna try it.
I remember that set. Should have picked one up....
This is good to hear. I‚Äôve been looking at a 10 year old, CS, Signatory bottling of Old Pulteney. I think I need to get this one. Bourbon cask.
> I may really be the odd one out by preferring the 12 Year over the old 17 Year

Not the only one, me too.

Not that I *dislike* the 17 in any way shape or form. But the 12 yo has a bright, fresh, lively quality that to my taste is a bit subdued in the 17 by way of comparison, which gives the 12 a *joie de vivre* that is really outstanding in scotch IMHO, and compensates for the lower level of complexity in it. 

Green Spot is the same way in Irish whiskey - a malt which is just very friendly and easy going. There is a place for those in my drinking preferences which I would not willingly give up, alongside the more somber & complex drams.

OP, nice review - very much agree. Out of curiosity, what is the bottle code on yours? It should have an L## / R## pair, I'm guessing that the ## after the letters encode the year.
I just wished the 12 was 46% ABV.
Old Pulteney is also a malt that I prefer out of bourbon casks rather than sherry. Again, it‚Äôs not to say that their sherry casks are bad, but that I prefer the spirit comparatively unvarnished. Balblair is also in that category, but given the redesign of the lineup, I doubt we‚Äôre going to see anything like the 1997 Second Edition that I loved so much again.
*the 12 yo has a bright, fresh, lively quality that to my taste is a bit subdued in the 17 by way of comparison, which gives the 12 a joie de vivre that is really outstanding in scotch IMHO* FM, stop right here! Ok, my arms twisted. I‚Äôll go buy some! ( thanks)
Sorry, just saw your comment. Got busy and didn't realize all this discussion was going on in my post. Laser code is L16/116 R16/5165 IB 09:47
>a malt that I prefer out of bourbon casks

I've read somewhere, I think on a distillery tour write-up, that they take pains to source air dried rather than kiln dried casks staves with their ex-bourbon casks. I don't know how seriously to take hearsay like that, but whatever they are doing certainly seems to work.

It is a great pity that both of the recent Inver House product relaunches at Pulteney & Balblair seem to have gotten off to a rocky start. The adage *if it ain't broke, don't fix it* would seem to have been overlooked in both cases.
Ha! Mission accomplished.

It probably wouldn't hurt if you are getting the USA 43% ABV version, I've seen fewer negative reviews of that - the 40% version seems to be missing some extra oomph.
Thanks! I'm guessing that is a 2016 - same as the most recent I've tried from my own stash, although a friend has a 2017 and hopefully sometime this fall we'll get together to do a side-by-side and see how they compare.
Are you on commission?

Yup, 43% and that‚Äôs good to hear. It all comes back to we all have different taste. I‚Äôm looking forward to trying some. Cheers
The fact that we get Highland Park, Laphroaig, and a few others at 43% instead of 40% is one of the few upsides to being a scotch fan in the States instead of the EU.
Oh nice. Can I come too? Is it in California perchance?
You'd be more than welcome, but as we are in NM you might have a bit of a drive ahead of you. The scenery would be worth it though, especially in Sept/Oct.
Ah rats, maybe if I'm ever over there. Thanks anyway!"

**Glenrothes 13 Single Cask #5578, 2003/2017, sherry barrel, 56.8%**

**Color:** I don't usually mention color but this is so thickly dark.

**Nose:** Rich honey, luxuriously sweet fruit, thick and chocolatey port wine, sludgy dark fruit, some thick malty Scotch comes through. All these notes hit you together like a wave

**Taste:** A thick and sludgy-sweet sherry bomb. Dark stewed fruits, luxuriously sweet cherry and strawberry syrup, smooth tobacco, caramel, rich scotchy malt. Everything about this is luxurious and thick and sweet, warm and fruity. Reminds me of the fruit candy sweetness I usually get from PX casks, but I can't find anything on what kind of sherry cask this actually is.

**Finish:** A long and complex finish. Sweet fruits build brighter and gets drawn out along with nice peppery spice action and syrupy dark cherry. Leaves Scotchy and sherry-sweet

*****

No mistaking the sherry influence here, that's for sure. Tastes like full maturation and PX sweetness to me, but I 'm just guessing here and don't necessarily know what I'm talking about. I'm not always big on sherried Scotch and I tend to be very picky with it, but I have to admit this is some pretty fantastic stuff. This is my kind of sherry bomb: Thick and smooth, a straight-up dessert Scotch without any sulphur or winey funk. Also I believe this is my first Glenrothes, so a double whammy!

I laughed about your comment that this was bottles exclusively for the State of Kansas, but you don‚Äôt know how that works. Haha. I also haven‚Äôt heard of a Distillery making a special bottling for a particular state. For a whisky society or a festival or for an event anniversary, sure. But for a random state!? It‚Äôs funny.

The whisky sounds good, too. :)
How does Kansas get these Glenrothes exclusive releases?  I have a Glenrothes 14yr Kansas exclusive that I picked up there last year.
You‚Äôve been hanging onto that sample for a while ;) I believe it was an oloroso cask, bottle didn‚Äôt mention but from what I searched that was my best guess.
This was an outstanding whisky, I really really enjoyed my sample. Great review!
I've had a Glendronach bottled for New Hampshire as well. I think it might have something to do with states that have state-run liquor stores, like the the agency picks a barrel since individual stores cant. But I'm not 100% sure.
Are you sure it's not the same one as this? Looking at the years on this one(2003-2014) the math seems to equal 14, but they must have pulled it shy of the 14 year mark.
I have even older samples than this hanging around haha. I believe this is from late 2017 when I gave you my Old Forester 1920 misfit. How did you end up liking that?

This was really good, whatever kind of cask it's from. I was in the mood for some sherry after seeing the Glendronach post on r/whiskyporn, and this hit the spot.

**Nose:** Light and floral, pear and green apple, barley sugar, easy malt, some smooth sweet caramel

**Taste:** Light and pleasantly malty. sweet vanilla, sugar, floral, thin pear fruitiness, that buttered popcorn flavor I usually associate with new make but it's a little richer here, bit of an ethanol burn. Water doesn't add a whole lot to this but smooths it out and richens it up a bit.

Not horrible but not a whole lot going on either, has that generic kind of ""malty refill barrel Scotch"" thing going on. Which is a shame because I know from experience that Linkwood can be some really delicious stuff. Wouldn't hurt so bad if IB prices weren't so high these days.

> Not horrible but not a whole lot going on either, has that generic kind of ""malty refill barrel Scotch"" thing going on. 

Interesting way of succinctly summarizing it, and a sentiment I've been thinking about more broadly recently.  The [Whisky Gods](http://www.divingforpearlsblog.com/2015/05/a-friendly-reminder-to-kill-your-whisky.html) tell us malt whisky aged in refill casks is the best kind of malt whisky.  But the problem is that you also need a characterful distillate and lots of time in the cask, and unfortunately many contemporary distillates have become modernized and homogenized, and in any case it's now exorbitantly expensive to get well-aged cask strength malt whisky.  So it's extremely difficult for us to get our hands on truly amazing malt whisky that doesn't have heavy-handed wood influence.

I see a lot of bottlings like this one on the shelves:  Approximately 10 years old, cask strength, refill cask, unpeated, from a distillery with a generally lighter, fruitier profile.  It's a great way to get a feel for the distillery character, but usually you have a feeling they won't be much more than ""malty refill barrel Scotch,"" as you put it.  And for $100, it's not particularly compelling.

Nice review!
A shame this one didn't do better. I've had a pair of mid-teens Linkwoods from BBR that were delicious. Sounds like either a tired cask or one that should have been left to slumber for another decade.
Yep, all kinds of stuff like this on the shelf and with the prices just not very compelling like you said. I should say right up front that I don't actually know what type of barrel this is, I'm assuming refill from the flavor and the color but the label doesn't actually say. But if blind tastings have taught me anything it's that I'm not immune to eating my words.

>many contemporary distillates have become modernized and homogenized

That's an interesting point. Reminds me of something else I heard once, in reference to K&L's IB exclusives. That a lot of their IB bottlings from no-name speyside/highland distilleries are ok, but they have a ""saminess."" 

Just the speculation of an uninformed enthusiast here, but maybe tired refill barrels are what keeps the IB industry alive and profitable. And for a quality 1st fill or well aged barrel, or anything from a respected distillery, you're basically gonna pay OB prices.
The label doesn't actually say the barrel type, but yeah that's what I suspect. Honestly though, I think it's the quality of Linkwood's spirit that saves this from being overly terrible or boring. Because it is still good in it's own low-impact kind of way.
> I think it's the quality of Linkwood's spirit that saves this from being overly terrible or boring

That makes sense with respect to my positive experiences with Linkwood - for a light, delicate, semi-anonymous blending trade malt it drinks well.

With these lackluster casks, my gut hunch is that they've been pulled too soon because of booming demand. Which is a shame because it seems to me that less aggressive casks are good for very extended aging without overoaking the whisky, especially one of the more delicate ones - who knows what this might have been like in another 20 or 30 years?
I bet this would have been a great candidate for long aging. Has that feel of something that is ""coming along nicely,"" and it doesn't quite feel like a solidly finished drinking experience as it is.

They might also have to think along the lines of price and sellability. With costs apparently going up, the price they would have to charge for an older Linkwood it simply might not sell as well. The idea used to be that you could buy older bottlings relatively cheap with IB's, but with prices approaching OB rates who is gonna want to buy an expensive bottling of a no-name distillery? It would incentivize them to only give long aging times to big name distilleries. 

Just random thoughts and speculations on my part, don't know how accurate any of it might be.
> With these lackluster casks, my gut hunch is that they've been pulled too soon because of booming demand.

Great point, and this is basically the sentiment that motivated the comment I made earlier in this review.  The current demand makes it hard to let casks age for more than 20 years, while at the same time making it impossible for most folks to afford anything that *is* aged for more than 20 years!"

**Nose:** Warm fruity sherry, rich honey, orange, caramel, robust malt, wine funk, spice, sweet tart fruits

**Taste:** Smooth and warm fruity sherry, sweet sticky caramel, orange, honey, rich malt, tart berry fruitiness starts to come through at the end. It's all very moothly balanced, there's nice warm sherry fruitiness and Scotchy malt but none of it is huge or overpowering. A nice kind of mellow complexity that I'm guessing comes with the age.

**Finish:** Tart fruitiness and smooth caramel with very mild peppery spice. Doesn't wow but a nice finish nonetheless.

*****

This stuff is elegant and smooth from start to finish, which can be a compliment or an insult depending on preference (or mood).  I usually prefer a sherry finish over a full maturation ""sherry bomb,"" and this is a good example of why. Nice fruity sherry influence but it retains its malty Scotch-ness without being too winey. Sometimes this bottle has been a tad too smooth for me, but I'm really enjoying this last bit. I wish I had maybe kept more around for visitors who aren't used to Cask Strength Whiskies becuse it's probably perfect for noobies.

*****

**WhistlePig Rye 10yr, 100/50% (done blind)**

**Nose:** Right off the bat I'm getting a Rye nose with lots of dill. Burnt brown sugar, butterscotch, musty toasted wood, cherry syrup, black liquorice, herbal Rye, dill, menthol nose-tingle

**Taste:** Creamy, sweet, and toasted with a nice Rye kick. Big minty and herbal Rye, dill, creamy butterscotch, sweet pastry, syrupy cherry zing, nicely toasted wood. That big cool Rye flavor is very pervasive but stays so well balanced with the sweet and creamy flavors.

**Finish:** Peppery and minty rye builds huge with bright creamy sweetness. Big long finish that leaves minty and sweet.

* Pretty sure it's a Rye, and a pretty good one. It's very creamy and sweet but with plenty of big Rye flavor. Very well balanced and enjoyable. The dill makes me think MGP, and the creaminess makes me think of Kentucky Owl Rye. Could be a smoother WhistlePig. It's a little on the overly smooth side which makes me think it's lower ABV, maybe on the lower end of cask strength or a well executed 90 proof.

Score: **7**

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** I reviewed this before, really liked it then too. The words ""creamy,"" ""sweet,"" and ""Rye"" came up a lot in that one as well. It can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/69eetl/community_review_44_whistlepig_rye/)(it was a community review, but mine is in there somewhere). These aren't known for dill a whole lot as far as I know, so not sure if that was in my head or just how the Rye manifested itself here. It's a good thing they bottle this at 50%, because it might just be too light any lower given how smooth it is. But it's a really tasty Whisky the way it is and they still offer the store pick single barrels if you're looking for a little more oomph.

"Review #103, Balblair 13 K&L Single Barrel",,https://i.redd.it/7wa9u6z16qg31.jpg,"**2005 Balblair 13 Single Barrel K&L pick, 1st fill Bourbon barrel 55.6%**

**Nose:** Rich and smoothly oaky. Dark caramel, rich vanilla, wood, darkly sweet chocolate berry, thick pastry malt, powdered sugar, tannic oak and ethanol burn

**Taste:** Signature rich and fruity Balblair malt comes more to the forefront, but still has a smoothly dark character. Darkly rich caramel malt, a low ember of darkly sweet fruitiness, orange, chocolate, sweet pastry maltiness, smooth oak, vanilla. Not the bright and fruity maltiness I'm used to with Balblair, there's a lot of oak character but it integrates well with the malt and creates this mellow and darkly smooth malty Scotch. 

**Finish:** Sweet oak and vanilla, menthol, leaves fruity with light chocolatey wood.

*****

I'm a big fan of Balblair, and I'm used more of a ""pop"" from them of rich, fun and fruity maltiness that just says ""hello!"" on the palate. I really feel like Balblair has an exceptional base spirit that works wonderfully on it's own or sherried, and here we get to see its dark side with lots of oak influence. It's a little more challenging and subdued, but there's lots of delicious flavor even if it doesn't quite jump out of the glass at you.

Sounds amazing, really liked their old presentation style. Rebrand and price hikes have taken the piss somewhat (and lost that character).

Thanks for sharing, would love to try this!
I have to admit, in the past, I always found Balblair forgettable. Not bad by any means, but just average.  However, because of your review and passion, I am going to give it another try this weekend.  Thanks for sharing.
I guess we got one right...
Sounds delicious, great review! I'm a big Balblair fan as well, love that malty flavor profile.
When did they rebrand? They've had the same bottle and box style for a while now haven't they?
I mean every distillery has its ups and downs, I have just found their ups to be really great. But I have a 16yr sherry finish from them right now that is like you said, good but a little meh. I personally feel that their malty Bourbon barrel stuff is where they really shine. Do you know what bottling you're gonna try?
Yeah, this one is really good. I also have the Craigellachie 12 sherry that I love. You guys release so many at a time, I try to strategically buy a couple that I think I'll like. Sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't. It's all part of the fun with single barrels I guess.

I really wish there was a way to sample some stuff out in the store though, that would be awesome and take the guesswork out. Every time I get a pick that I'm not crazy about, I wonder which one I could have bought that I might have enjoyed more. But I realize it's probably not that easy, and the logistics of offering something like that in a store might be difficult.

One thing I gotta say as a Bourbon fan, holy shit the Russel's Reserve picks have been just amazing. I've had 3 or 4 now and every single one is just so good.
Thanks! Yeah their malt is so yummy
This is the now phased out style, there'll still be that stock around in shops for a while. Change was sometime around March 2019
I have a 2001 that was bottled in 2012.  The bottle looks like your picture (except it has O1).  Anyway, I am going to pour a wee dram tonight and kick off the weekend.

I hope you enjoy your weekend!
I'm actually picking up a second bottle of the Balblair because I really liked the whisky and it's in the old embossed bottle.  

On a related note, I was seriously tempted by their new Glenlivet pick because their Signatory picks have been good but I got turned off by the price and age ($99 for a 12 year old).  They had a 19 year old Glenlivet a few years that only cost $89!  Granted I think market conditions have caused the recent price jumps so it's not really K&L's fault.
Oh man, I didn't realize. That's about the time this came out. Is this the new style seen here? https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/48762/balblair-15-year-old

Please tell me this isn't the new style
Unfortunately it is. Crazy price hikes for 15-25yo expressions, shelving of iconic, integrity presentation (and vintages), all for this generic crap. Marketing department fucked up big time.
Yeah they had the most beautiful bottles, very distinct with the embossed Celtic design and all. And I've always loved the wide mouth, pouring from that big lip is so easy and such a pleasure. I'll be honest though, sometimes that vintage system was a little frustrating. I'm not against the idea, and it was cool in its uniqueness, but I've seen different bottlings with all the same stats before that made tracking down a specific bottle I liked difficult."

**Finish:** A really nice long finish, big tart fruitiness pops with smooth charred wood and menthol

* Delicious stuff, but it doesn‚Äôt immediately remind me of anything. It doesn‚Äôt scream Rye to me even though there is tons of mint and menthol in the nose and mouthfeel. Feels like a solid mid 50‚Äôs ABV. A little too light on the palate but it‚Äôs tasty.

Dickel gets no love. These are actually quite good but not the MGP taters seek and not the price people want to pay for Dickel.
Nice! I have a low proof (89) bottle that I snagged at my liquor store for pretty cheap that I love. It‚Äôs been a great easy sipper for me. I also don‚Äôt get a ton of the vitamin from Dickel that everyone else claims to taste.
Wow. You did not sample my bottle. Blind or not mine you could smell from a mile away and it wasn‚Äôt a pleasant smell. I tried so hard to like it. First time I poured a bottle down the drain. My palate is not ready for reviews but it knew this stuff was not good.  Happy to see someone liked it, I was mad at my liquor store for a bit after the 65 bucks I lost......lol
That‚Äôs for the review! What is this poster with monkey in the background?
I simply can't believe itüòÑ
Well that certainly *came out of left field*.

Oh, wait.
You sure it is the select line?  I haven't seen any that have that low of proof, but damn if i don't LOVE me some low proof MGP SAOS
Was it 50.5% like the one I reviewed?
Did you, like me, get a bottle of the Dickel Multivitamin??
Just a silly poster, it's the only angle in my house I like to constantly post. I think it's supposed to be some old add for a liqueur or something.
I was coming to ask that question....
I know, but this was a totally blind sample so what can I say. I might have been looking for that Flintstone Vitamin if I had known what it was. Anyway, sorry you didn't like yours this much haha
No that was [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/cp4uli/review_105_four_roses_private_selection_obsq_done/)
K&L got a bunch of the newer SAOS single barrels in, and there were definitely some in the 45-50% range.
Yep, it‚Äôs 43.99% and is the SBS. I was shocked, but it‚Äôs great juice to me
I believe it was 56. They had a few and I went with the highest they had. It was strange that they had 5 bottles and they were different proofs. Mine smelled like NyQuil
Yep. Let some air in the bottle for a few weeks and tried a few more times. Then dumped it. I have an unopened bottle of dickle bottled in bond, I think I may keep it sealed as I do not want a hint of that nose again.
wow very interesting, didn't realize dickel was putting out super low proofers like that"

**Four Roses Private Selection OBSQ, 126.4/63.2%**

**Nose:** Gritty charred wood and burnt toffee, strong menthol that is almost medicinal like an Islay Scotch, root beer char, herbal spice. Dark and charred with a strong menthol presence, yummy Rye nose.

**Taste:** Pretty sure we are dealing with a Rye here. Instant assault of menthol and hot peppery spice with bright syrupy-sweet cherry, dark charred wood, gritty burnt caramel, hot cinnamon

**Finish:** Long peppery finish, very nice. The hot peppery spice builds big then settles into hot cherry cough syrup and clean toasted oak. The cherry syrup and spice tingle lasts forever.

* This is a fierce Rye I think, just the way I like them. It's hot, 55-60% ABV. The heavy menthol reminds me of Knob Creek Rye, but I was looking for Bourbon influence here and couldn't find it. So I'm gonna say a WhistlePig single barrel because of all the awesome Rye and barrel notes, although it is quite a bit more charred than those tend to be.

Score: **9**

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** This isn't the first time a Four Roses ""B"" recipe has fooled me into thinking it's a Rye, and I really enjoyed that other one too. With all the action-packed spice and dark char I even briefly considered ""what if this is a FRPS?"" but it just didn't seem very Bourbony to me. I'm a little biased towards Rye, so I'll be honest and admit that I probably would have scored this a little lower(8) if I knew it was a Bourbon. But it's an excellent Four Roses for sure, and I wish I knew more about it but my mystery partner didn't send any more info. These are some of my favorite Whiskeys out there, and I seem to really like the ""Q"" recipes a lot, so I'm not surprised I liked it so much even if it did fool me.

This is an old school classic and I'm seeing more people pick it in a blind.  Snooty people try to ride on that Blantons dick would do good to put this in their collection.
Blanton's is fine for an entry level Bourbon I think, although I never much cared for it. But yeah paying crazy prices and fighting tooth and nail to get some while stuff like this is on the shelves is crazy.
I agree on the Blanton's. Taste-wise it's suited to new bourbon drinkers. It just doesn't have enough going on to stay interesting.
It's marketing strategy at it's finest and not worth the second hand market prices."

*****

**Blade and Bow Bourbon, 45.5%**

**Nose:** Yummy caramel and big orange, creamy butterscotch, sweet and minty, smooth mild spice and toasted barrel char. A pleasant and easy-going nose.

**Taste:** Little more of a kick than the easy-going nose, but still quite sweet and smooth. Orange and warmly sweet caramel, friendly toasted wood, sweet vanilla, a pleasant kind of sharp and tingling spice, faint barrel char. With some air there's lots of smooth mint.

**Finish:** Builds to a very nice finish of cherry cola, warm orange, and lots of spice. This is like a perfect spice, it's strong and flavorful yet not harsh or challenging, it's tingly in a very pleasant way.

* It's extremely well balanced and flavorful, I think it's a decent proof in the lower 50's that gives it plenty of flavor but remains pleasantly smooth. At first this reminded me of some very smooth and easy-drinking Wild Turkeys I've had, only without the big musty wood notes. But with some air lots of spice and mint emerge, has me thinking this might be a Rye. I'm struggling to come up with a guess though.

Score: **7**

**Post reveal thoughts:** Holy shit, color me surprised. I honestly don't know anything about this stuff. In my mind it is just another craft-looking label that I pass over all the time at shops. Much better than I ever would have expected. ""pleasant and smooth"" is nice and all, but to me the biggest compliment(other than the score) is my guess of low 50's ABV. Impressive amount of flavor and mouthfeel packed into this for 45.5%. I would buy a bottle of this.

**EDIT:** I've been searching around and I can not find any other favorable reviews lol. Dunno what to say, I love big spicy bruisers but I'm also a sucker for sweet and smooth Bourbons, and this almost drank like a WHEATER. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Sorry this is off topic but where do you all get the small bottles/vials to put your samples in? I can‚Äôt seem to find them. Great review too! Thanks
I'm a fan of Blade and Bow, so I'm glad to see someone else enjoying it!
Nice to see a fair review on this one without all the negative bias that usually comes into play. Thanks!
I like Blade & Bow, but I feel like it's a forty dollar bourbon being sold for fifty.
Thank you both
That's fun. Maybe they improved their process. Had it a while back and it was kind of boring to me. Nothing really offensive. It tasted like bourbon. I passed on a second glass of it. 

I'm starting to see favorable reviews of things like Few Rye and Rabbit Hole also. I have to wonder how different these bottles are from the actual ones I got hold of.
Funny you mentioned wheaters, just finished pour of Rebell SiB. However I bought a bottle of B&B and did not like it at all especially for price, about $50 here. It's simply outclassed in that price range and by bottles cheaper like Rare Breed.

But yeah I think this is the 1st positive review or mention for it I've seen lol.
Currently drinking this and I agree with every aspect of your review.
No problem. They are 2oz Boston Rounds, some people here are in a group that trades these samples with each other. There used to be a subreddit for it called r/scotchswap, but it got banned.
I mean I reviewed it blind, so I've gotta just go with it for better or worse

*****

**Russell's Reserve Single Barrel, K&L pick barrel #17-384, rickhouse D, Floor 3 70 1, 110/55%**

**Nose:** Huge chocolatey-smooth toasted oak, vanilla, lots and lots of nose-tingling menthol, subdued herbal spice, darkly sweet maple barrel char. It's dark and rich but with a very strong menthol presence, very enticing and interesting.

**Taste:** Darkly sweet and toasted, utterly drinkable and tasty in a way I've come to expect with these. Cherry cola and darkly toasted wood, sweet char, vanilla, more smooth wood, sticky sweet caramel. 

**Finish:** Dark sweet cherry and caramel with cool herbal spice. The dark sweetness and mild spice tingle stays with me for a while, very nice.

*****

I love how much these barrels can vary and yet they all have that same effortlessly delicious, drinkable feel. And the huge mellow and musty Wild Turkey wood is always just ridiculously good. This one is subdued & sweet, dark & charred, with an interesting element of menthol and mellow herbal spice. So balanced and drinkable. I'm getting to a point where I hate not having a bottle open.

What was the price of that bad boy?
Thanks for the great review.
This sounds delicious. Thanks for the review!
Thanks for the excellent review - just picked one up.
RR store picks can be absolute cherry bombs...and I love it.
I love this bottle. Such solid cherry and caramel notes. 
  
Just picked up a K&L Rickhouse D, Floor 4 #17-399 bottle as back up. If this is as good as the #17-384 I may have to buy a case.
very interesting. sounds like it's encroaching onto spiced rum territory. might have to try this one, though i can't stand the overpowering flavors in spiced rum proper.
I recently tried my first RR (single barrel rye) and lived it. I was considering giving this a try. You have officially pushed me over the edge.
Thanks for reading! These usually run around $60, similar to the non-store pick versions, I got this one for $48.
It sure is, and you're welcome!
From K&L I assume? Which one? Honestly their picks are from being a sure thing for me(especially with Scotch), but their Russel's Reserve picks are just always amazing. I don't know if that's a testament to Wild Turkey, K&L, or both.

It's one of the few bottles where every time I open one it's really fun and exciting, and I'm not just holding my breath thinking ""did I just waste X amount of dollars on this?""
$48? Damn, I just paid $65. The price of bourbon in the Bay Area is rising at the same pace as housing.
The 17-384. There was one bottle left.  I have had mixed results with their other picks (Eagle Rare, KC), so it helps to see a review!
It was on sale, $65 is the normal price. They have a few others on sale right now
Oh right on, didn't realize they still had some.

> I have had mixed results with their other picks

Totally agree, but I've had 3 or 4 of their Russels Reserve picks and they've all been fantastic. I may have been drunk last night and got a little overexcited with my scoring, but it's delicious and still an easy 7. Curious to hear your thoughts.
> I may have been drunk last night and got a little overexcited with my scoring

Oh NOW you tell me. ..
Like bringing home a lady from the bar that at the time is an 8/10 but the next day, not so much lol
Not by much is all I'm saying haha, it really is a good one and I dont think you'll be disappointed.
Hot damn, I'm revisiting this bottle for the first time since I opened and reviewed it, and I don't think I exaggerated like I said. This stuff is seriously fucking good. I might have even undersold the finish if anything, this is a really good RR.
Holy crap this store pick is good!  I had it blind against my other store pick, which until now was my favorite against 5-6 others. This K&L batch beats it hands down.  Your tasting notes are spot on.  Superior pour - reminds me of some of the dusty turkeys I‚Äôve had.
Haha you know it's good when you double back to a week-old discussion. I've had some mixed results with K&L picks, with both Scotch and American Whiskey. But Russel's Reserve seems immune to all that, every one I've tried from them has been amazing. But this one is probably the best I've had as well. Glad you like it, and glad I didn't steer you wrong!
Have u tried the 17-399?  Tempted with the Insider Advantage pricing.
No I haven't tried it yet, I've got one on hold in Hollywood though. Might go tomorrow or next weekend to pick my stuff up. I'll let you know if I do. I plan on opening it.

That's why I've tried so many of these from K&L, they keep putting them on sale for $40-$45 and I can't resist, and so far every single one has been a winner. I think 17 is supposed to designate the bottling year(?) but they've been releasing them for a few years now."

**Taste:** Brash zing of hot cherry, big peppery and herbal spice, burnt sticky caramel, with some air there's smooth chocolate and charred wood, a little metallic.

**Finish:** medium length finish, lots of spice and hot cherry

* This is a spice bomb, but not in an overly hot or unpleasant way. Reminded me of a Knob Creek at first, but doesn't taste nearly as oaky or hot as those tend to be. It tastes like a deceptively smooth 50-55%. I'm gonna say based on the really nice smooth wood notes that it's maybe an extra spice-y Russel's Reserve SiB.

Score: **6**

*****

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** 

Damnit! I almost wrote that I could see this being a barely legal Rye, but it felt like I was throwing too many guesses out there with the Knob Creek and RR and I needed to just calm down and commit to something. Looking back all my notes just scream ""Rye!"" 

I'm assuming this is a Kentucky distilled Willett, and like another 4yr I've had it's really really good for the age. The wood notes are delicious and amazing for something so young. If there's any indication of the youth to my uneducated palate it's that it's just a tad disheveled and there's that metallic kind of flavor I often get from younger spirit. But all in all this is totally enjoyable and impressive.

nice review, but whats with the small dram instead of the actual 750ml bottle? I've seen this in a few posts....haven't figured it out yet.
Thanks!  Appreciate the info.
Yeah I agree. I normally prefer my Rye mashbill 95-100%, but there's no denying how good this stuff is. I've done 2 blind tastings of 2 different batches recently, and they've both come out winners. Interestingly I guessed knob creek on that one too.

Haha I hope you're not trying to drop me hints. I dont have either bottle on hand, but if you supply them I'd be happy to do a sbs like that :P
Isn't Pikesville Heaven Hill? My bad if I misunderstood
Those are two of my go to Ryes, but man they are polar opposite. Pikesville is far more herbal/spicy noted. Willett is my sipping Rye, Pikesville is my cocktail Rye.
I really like this stuff. Really love the 114 proof batch I have. I can't imagine how nice this stuff will be in a few years.

**1792 Full Proof store pick, 125/62.5% (done blind)**

**Nose:** Chocolate, rich oak, big cool mint undercurrent, nose-tingling spice, rich wood and big chocolatey oak. Man that menthol is pretty intense

**Taste:** Tastes pretty hot. Dark hot cherry, rich burnt caramel and brash Whiskey, a metallic quality that I always associate with FRPS, sharp mint but it's not as front and center as I would expect from a Rye, chocolate, cinnamon, big dark explosion of hot spice

**Finish:** Long finish, spicy red hot with minty rye. That vibrant spice really stays with you for a while

* The nose and finish had me thinking a nice big oaky Rye, and initially I was thinking a WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel. but the more I drink it it feels like a Four Roses Private Select. It has that cacaphony of brash flavors that seems to work well, and this has a lot of oak and Rye spice to me. I feel like some water might have helped this a little but I'm always afraid to add any to a 2oz sample. Probably around 60%.

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** I haven't had a whole lot of experience with 1792, so this was a cool one to try. I'm impressed for sure. Google says their mashbill is undisclosed but most likely high Rye, so I feel good about my guess.

"Review #100, A.H. Hirsch 16yr Bourbon, 1974",,https://i.redd.it/05b6fn1eqqe31.jpg,"I'm currently knee deep in reviewing 9 different mystery samples, but thought I would take a little break to review a zinger for my 100th because if not now then when? This sample comes courtesy of u/Dixie_Mafia1982 who is one of the best guys you'll ever get to know around here, or anywhere else. And yes he has totally bought my love with this and other amazing samples.

There's a lot of hype around this one, it was distilled in the spring of 1974 at the old Michter's distillery in Schaefferstown, PA then aged for 16 years and bottled in 1991. Long story short they go for lots of money now. (I'm no expert, so feel free to correct me if I have any of this wrong)

*****

**1974 A.H. Hirsch 16 year Straight Bourbon, 45.8%**

**Nose:** Deep, rich, deliciously smooth oakiness, this is an amazing nose. Deeply toasted oak, maple, fudge, amazingly rich and clean wood notes, huge fruitiness of orange and black cherry, clean vanilla and menthol. Beautiful oaky char at the tail end. Huge and rich but so smooth and balanced at the same time, it hits every single ""smooth oaky Bourbon"" note in the book and hits them well.

**Taste:** Very nice but it's subtle and complex, a little light and it doesn't just immediately floor me like the nose did. Surprisingly fruity and sweet with lots of clean, pleasant toasted wood. It's not overly oaked or tannic at all, it's a delicious kind of sweet toasted maple woodiness. Flows together beautifully with clean vanilla, cherry and orange zest, light smooth chocolate, pleasant caramel. Once I acclimate to the lower proof it has this silky smooth mouthfeel but without being short on rich flavor. Not every Bourbon has to be a high proof smack to the face, and this stuff illustrates that perfectly.

**Finish:** Sweet and smoothly oaky. Sweet caramel and vanilla with clean, utterly delicious chocolatey toasted wood. Not a long enough finish, but very tasty and enjoyable.

This was a delicious pour. Amazingly balanced and smooth but not short on rich and delicious flavor. For better or worse I'm a total proof whore, and the low ABV here definitely took a few sips to adjust to. But once I did I was thoroughly rewarded. It's nice to just sit and enjoy something with such a silky smooth mouthfeel that still has so much amazing flavor and doesn't feel thin or watered down. That being said, while it does well for 46% it is still noticeably light at such a low ABV. Especially on the finish, which is tasty but a little weak. It's definitely no replacement for the huge bold flavors of a good barrel proof Bourbon, but it's perfect in it's own way.

Great review, and congrats on making it to 100!  I have also been the lucky recipient of this sample from u/Dixie_Mafia1982, and split it with u/TheWoddah a while back.  As I recall, we were both aligned with your tasting notes.  While it didn‚Äôt live up to the legend, I‚Äôm not sure anything could. The only thing that‚Äôs 100% worth the hype is DixieMafia, who is, in fact, the man.
Awesome that you got to try it! A true unicorn pour.
As usual great review my friend! I have the same sample too i need to try it soon to :)
Big shoutout to u/Dixie_Mafia1982
I think this drinks more like cognac than bourbon. The profile is a little subdued, but it does have a lot of complexity.
Congrats on the 100th review, nicely done sir!
I share your sentiment completely. This has an amazing profile but the lower proof really holds it back from being special in today's standards. Back in the day when 100 proof was the highest most people drank, this was totally fine. I feel if it were released at barrel proof it would drink like a Michters 20. Cheers on 100 reviews!
Yes, what a guy and very well put haha. 

It lived up to its hype better than some other stuff I've tried, but yeah it's hardly the end-all of Bourbon. It's not perfect, or ""the best bourbon you'll ever have,"" but I do feel like I was sipping on something special. Its tasty stuff.
That‚Äôs high praise, thx man!
Funny thing is it was given to me as a surprise bonus sample, and I must have just glanced at the ""16 year"" because all this time I thought it was hochstadter's rye. I only recently found out what I actually had in time for #100.
Thx buddy
Yeah I can see that, especially an armagnac since it's so oaky and rich. I haven't tried a lot of cognacs. But subdued and complex is a good way to put it
Thanks, and thank you for the awesome sample!
Thanks dude. 

>Back in the day when 100 proof was the highest most people drank, this was totally fine

This was exactly my thought while drinking this. It kind of took me back to a simpler time where Bourbon could just be good and smooth. I even scored it a little higher than I normally would because I was trying to judge it by those standards."

*****

**Four Roses Small Batch Select, 104/52% (done blind)**

**Nose:** Rich tannic oak, caramel, hot cherry and spice, vanilla, wood char, tobacco, menthol. Classic oaky Bourbon nose, immediately reminded me of Buffalo Trace

**Taste:** It's oaky Bourbon goodness, somewhere in between smooth and pleasantly brash. Big oaky caramel, lots of Bourbon spice, hot brash corn, Vanilla, big friendly wood char, tannic wood, chocolate.

**Finish:** Medium length, very spicy Bourbon finish that slowly simmers down

* This tastes like a classic oaky Bourbon but has kind of a ""standard issue"" feel, nothing crazy or unusual going on. It makes me think of Buffalo Trace but I'm pretty sure it's higher than 45%. So I'll say Colonel EH Taylor because 50% feels about right.

Score: **5**

*****

**Post reveal thoughts:**  An awesome sample, I've really wanted to try this one. I enjoyed it, but honestly the Private Selects are some of my favorite Bourbon out there so I really thought I would have liked this more. Having such high hopes and expectations built up around this bottle made it a really great one to drink blind. Looking at it now, I think it is a little more brash and spicy than the mellower BT Whiskies I mentioned, but it's so oaky so my mind just went there.

Nice, I agree with all your notes, including that it's somewhat brash. I just personally like it more, possibly. I'd probably call it a 6.

Good review.
Honestly I'm kind of biased towards Four Roses, love the stuff. I probably would have given it a 6 if I had known what I was drinking. That's the fun of blind tastings though.

*****

**High West ""Double Rye!"" Manhattan finsh, 105/52.5%(done blind)**

**Nose:** Fruity and creamy nose, lightly sweet, very inviting. Creamy butterscotch, apple, tart berry, orange, sugar, black cherry with some ashy burnt oak char, menthol, thickly smooth wood, sweet toffee

**Taste:** Sweet caramel and bright sugar, apple fruitiness, settles into buttery creaminess and warm orange, light menthol and fun spice. Sweet and light but it maintains some creaminess and body to keep it from tasting too weak. Very pleasant. 

**Finish:** Warm friendly spice builds, sweet mellow caramel, chocolate and orange

* Doesn't quite reach ""spectacular"" levels but it's thoroughly tasty and enjoyable, Lots of fun with no complaints. I feel like the proof is just right for this profile, it delivers plenty of nice sweet flavor and body but it's not ass-kicking proof and remains pleasant. I'm gonna say low 50's ABV, and my first impression was some kind of WHEATER like 1792 Sweet Wheat. But towards the end it almost reminded me of High West Rye with some kind of strange finish(not red wine) like Rum or Bourbon barrel. 

Score: **6**

*****

**Post reveal thoughts:** Not gonna lie, pattin' myself on the back with this one. The sweet creaminess had me thinking WHEATER at first, but the Rye notes really started coming through as I drank it. My guess of ""not red wine"" on the barrel finish was kind of wrong, but to me it's a compliment since it retains it's Whiskey flavor with a fun fruity twist. IMO we don't need more overwhelming wine finishes like YKY(*shudder*).

Getting close to the 100th review, thx for the hard work, cheers!
Unrelated but I have that poster! I have the marijuana one as well
Cheers buddy! I still have 8 more of these mystery samples to go, but I may have to take a break to drink the 1974 Hirsch 16 year I got from you. I still think that will make a good #100.
I see you're a man of culture as well
Sounds good to me ;-) Well the AH Hirsh a good #100 review to me, pretty hard to find and a lot of hype around it too, looks like a good candidate. Having some 2018 WLW at the moment, this would also be a good candidate trust me ;-) Cheers!"

"Review #97 Knob Creek Rye Single Barrel, Super Fine Wine & Liquor",,https://i.redd.it/0n5b2h7ahcd31.jpg,"Sample courtesy of u/RudolphSchmidt

*****

**Knob Creek Rye Single Barrel, Super Fine Wine & Liquor, 115/57.5%**

**Nose:** Nicely rich and burnt Rye nose. Butterscotch, hot cinnamon and burn, spicy wood. Rye character with fierce pine and spearmint, settles down into gritty char and burnt maple. 

**Taste:** Burnt and dark in a good way with lots of spice. Charred wood, a big zing of hot cinnamon cherry and strong peppery spice, really nice brash corn kick. Brightens into sweet fruitiness and sticky caramel. Light menthol mouthfeel. It's hot and lively with some nice flavor but it's missing the rich backbone and sharp Rye quality that made the nose really nice for me.

**Finish:** It's a long and spicy finish. Hot cherry cough syrup and spice, lightly rich caramel, a hint of menthol Rye shows up which makes me happy. Keeps building brighter and sweeter.

*****

This is good stuff, a real spicy kicker that is enjoyable and doesn't just taste needlessly hot. It's all over the place, very hot and lively like a Four Roses Private Select but it doesn't quite pull it off as well as those usually do. It's not Rye enough for my personal tastes, I wish the strong Rye character in the nose carried through on the palate more. But for the $40-$50 I see these go for, this is a solid bottle of barely-legal Rye.

Did this come from Super Fine Wine & Liquor in Canton, MI? Not often I see a local place on the Reddit boards.
Was there an age statement for this store pick?
Man I suck at making labels
I only had a 2oz sample of it for this review, but yes I think that my friend I got it from is in Michigan. I mean how many Super Fine Wines could there be?
Hey - just seeing this now lol

Ya same place :) 

Laith and his crew are the best!
5 years and some change. I'd have to look at the exact age when I'm home.
You would have to ask u/RudolphSchmidt
It just said ""BD 2"" originally, I awkwardly wrote in the rest myself so I wouldn't lose track of what it was haha. I've seen much worse. Like when someone puts a new label right over the old one, that shit gives me anxiety.
Hey, it's a big country; there could be a bunch of them. Super Fine does get some pretty great picks though. I'm lucky that within 20 miles of me there are around 50 shops that get barrel picks of rum, tequila, and of course bourbon.
Thanks, is that 5 on top of the 9 years for KCSiBRs?
Summoning /u/RudolphSchmidt
A bit late but since you never got a reply I'll clarify. 9 years is the regular age for the Single Barrel Bourbon where as this is a rye store pick. Rye's tend to hit their sweet spot at a younger age so, aside from expensive offerings, they tend to be much younger. Point being, he means just a straight 5 years old."
"Review #102, Balvenie 14 Caribbean Cask",,https://i.redd.it/aoey6149gdc31.jpg,"Sample courtesy of u/CatsFullofBeer

**Balvenie 14 ""Caribbean Cask,"" rum cask finish, 43%**

**Nose:** Rich and creamy. Big toffee and creamy malt, maple syrup, warm orange citrus, tart berries, nice peppery spice, sharp vanilla, slight ashy char and wood funk on the tail end

**Taste:** It's a little subdued and ""smooth,"" but overall it has nice mouthfeel and flavor for 43%. Creamy and buttery malt, smooth easy toffee, sticky sweet sugar pastry, floral orange citrus, tart fruit, light peppery spice that adds nice flavor but isn't overly strong

**Finish:** Lightly sweet caramel and dessert pastry maltiness, some slight tropical fruit. Bit of a weak finish but it's soft, sweet, and pleasant enough.

*****

Tasty stuff. Rum cask finishes are interesting to me, because they never really remind me of Rum. I would expect a heavy sweetness or exotic flavor of some kind, but instead they are creamy, rich, and sweet in a way that only compliments and amplifies the malt. That has been my experience with other Rum finished Scotch(Springbank and Benriach come to mind), and it's my experience here as well. Unfortunately I think they hurt this by releasing it at 43%, because it stops juuuust shy of greatness imo. Which is a shame, because it's a delicious bottle and very well executed. Their 12yr Single Barrel and 15yr Sherry Barrel are both bottled at about 48%, so I don't know why they wouldn't give this the same treatment it deserves. Worth checking out, especially for beginners looking for a smooth yet rich and delicious Scotch.

This thing desperately needs to be 46% ABV.

There is some nice flavors in there but they are so hidden and light.
nice review. totally agree about the proof of this. if I had this blind I don't think I'd guess rum cask.

check out the Barrell Whiskey batch 4 and the Ardbeg Drum CR for some really strong rum cask influence.
Great review. I agree. This is one tasty dram, but would benefit from additional proof.
>if I had this blind I don't think I'd guess rum cask.

That's how I feel about other Rum finished stuff I've had too. It really makes a Scotch rich and creamy to me without imparting any strong notes of it's own. I even have a High West Double Rye aged in Rum barrel that is similar.

Haven't tried these ones you mentioned though. I'm curious about that Ardbeg for sure."
"Review #101, Lagavulin 8",,https://i.redd.it/cm93bv8uxrb31.jpg,"This was originally released in 2016 for Lagavulin's 200th anniversary, it was popular or something so they decided to keep it as part of their permanent lineup. I remember it was a pretty big deal at the time. It's natural color, unchillfiltered, and 48%, which is impressive for an OB bottling from a mainstream distillery. Sample is courtesy of u/ArtGar95

*****

**Lagavuin 8, 48%**

**Nose:** Proper Islay peat this is, but it's very spirit forward. Raw ashy peat, tar, buttered popcorn new make, brine, smoke, green apple, spice tingle

**Taste:** Lots of new make spirit, but it is very good quality. Doesn't taste disgustingly ""new-makey"" or ethanol heavy like some IB's I've had. Clean smoke, lemon, sharply sweet vanilla, buttery malt. It's all pervaded by a really nice big warm peat. The smoke is not so aggressive as the nose, and overall this Scotch is very sweet and spirit forward but in a good way.

**Finish:** Surprisingly sweet and easy. Builds to a nice fruity pop, then mellows into sweet smooth vanilla, mild spice, lingering smoke

*****

I enjoyed this very much, and it's not really what I was expecting at all which is actually kind of nice. I was expecting something more brash and feisty that uses it's youth to it's advantage to make a mean Islay peat monster, like Octomore or Kilchoman or young IB's. Instead this almost feels like it's a showcase for Lagavulin's spirit, with just the right amount of skillful barrel influence to round it out. That kind of delicate balancing act to me is even more impressive in it's own way, it shows they have some quality product and impressive skills over there.

Nice review! I love this stuff.  It's a nice change of pace, smoky but with a youthful crisp brightness to it, balanced out by a sweet element.  It reminds me of Ardbeg 10 in that way.  Although the Laga has more spicy notes imho.

I only tried it because several esteemed members of this board had mentioned it, and it instantly became a fave of mine, especially for the price.  Unfortunately, I cannot find it in my area - the one time I did it was due to an ordering error!
Thanks for the review! Laga runs toward the middle of the pack for me as far as Islays go, mostly because of releases like this one and the 12CS. The distillery produces wonderful spirit, and the less they fuck with it in terms of sherry casks, long aging and water/filtering, the better, IMO.
Great review, sounds amazing. Looks like another one just got added to the list.
Ha, yea, I think you are right. This just sounds so basic and good. At $55 I‚Äôll pick one up.
I got a bottle at $55~, which seems to be pretty standard MSRP in most places. At that price point there's no reason not to try this. It's very good.
>It's a nice change of pace, smoky but with a youthful crisp brightness to it, balanced out by a sweet element.

You summed it up nicely, that's basically how I feel. It's impressive for something so unique to come out of Islay, and it's really good.
+1, agreed! Great review OP
Yeah the 12 is fantastic, its up there with the best islays imo. Ive only ever had a 2oz sample though. 

Its neat they can pull off several totally different styles for different markets, it does shows skill in both marketing and making whisky.
I think you say that every time I review something good lol. I wouldn't say this is a ""must have,"" but it is a ""must try."" Its a unique Lagavulin for sure. But if you have to buy it to try it, then so be it!

**Elmer T Lee, 45%**

**Nose:** Sweet and quite oaky, but in a light friendly way. Very musty wood, wet cardboard, light chocolate, grape fruitiness, wood, sweet vanilla, prominent root beer, well toasted barrel char. Very nice nose.

**Taste:** It's kind of thin and watered down at first after that really nice nose, but once I acclimate it's nice. Lightly rich caramel and super sweet vanilla, twangy char, graham cracker, sweet fruits, clean toasted wood. It's pretty sweet, but there's some cool funky wood notes that make it kind of interesting too. Nothing gets too overpowering or unpleasant with the low ABV though.

**Finish:** Vanilla cake icing, sweet corn, very light pepper, settles into some ashy char and funky wood. The finish isn't quite strong or long enough to be a problem though, remains kind of simple and even-keeled.

*****

I've only tried this once a few years ago and I don't remember liking it all that much. I felt the same about Rock Hill Farms and Blantons, and this was before I knew they were all the same Buffalo Trace mashbill. So once I discovered the link between the 3 it seemed like an open and shut case, so I wrote it off and I never looked back since the stuff is impossible to get anyway. 

But this is much better than I remember. I'm not gonna sit here and say it punches above it's weight or anything-it's only 45% and it shows, being kind of thin and watered down. But in it's own ""entry level thin"" kind of way it is very oaky and funky and it works well with all the sweetness, and IMO the low ABV helps keep it all kind of balanced and pleasant. As usual with these hyped up bottles it's not worth those crazy prices it fetches nowadays at all, but it's good enough that I can see how the hype must have initially started.

Thank you for the tasting notes. I have been hunting for a bottle. This tells me I am on the right track but do not pay the high premiums.
Elmer T Lee prior to 2013 is an entirely different beast to what they produce today. The same really goes for Blanton's as well but Elmer is especially true. Today's is an ok $30 bottle being sold for a lot more than that in many cases. It falls in line with the mediocre quality of mashbill #2. That said, if someone wants Elmer and can't find it buy Bowman single barrel and you'll be happier.
Good luck! Luckily there's lots of stuff out there that I feel is better than this and easier to find.
I've heard good things about bowman a few times now, never tried any though.
Nice review..such as?
Off the top of my head Four Roses Single Barrel, Russel's Reserve Single Barrel, Willett, EH Taylor, Pikesville. But I guess it's all subjective in the end of course. 

I'm having trouble thinking of anything similar in profile that's readily available. Maybe Evan Williams Single Barrel, I remember that being pretty oaky and sweet.
>Maybe Evan Williams Single Barrel

Cosigned. 

EW SiB has some notes similar to ETL to my taste, notably apples in both bottles. ETL is a little bit sweeter IMHO, but the similarities are there, especially in the EW SiB bottles from the 2009 vintage onwards, having gotten younger than the bottles which were issued in years past.
I've been meaning to squeeze the trigger on 4R SiB for 54.99+tax at my local dram dealer but i don't particularly like regular 4R so it's been hard to justify taking the leap but everyone seems to say it's a different animal. I love EHT.
That's high for 4R SiB -- I typically see it anywhere from $35-$42. You may want to check other shops in your area (unless that's the price for one of the Private Selections, in which case you should grab it)"
"Review #95, Maker's Mark Cask Strength",,https://i.redd.it/3f8pkub5kjb31.jpg,"[deleted]
**Makers Mark Cask Strength, batch 17-02, 110.7/55.35%**

**Nose:** My first impression is how quintessentially ""Bourbon"" this smells, like how a Bourbon might have smelled to you before you were actually into Bourbon. Not bad but nothing remarkable. Hot harsh zing, toasted wood, peppery spice, sweet buttery toffee, tobacco, black cherry, some harsh Bourbon corn. Lot's of nice notes but it's approaching on being overly astringent.

**Taste:** It's hot and sweet. Punchy hot cherry with lots of spice and brash Bourbon corn sweetness, builds very hot and spicy. There's a bit of a sweet and creamy mouthfeel indicating the Wheat, but it's hiding behind a lot of punchy spice and heat.

**Finish:** Hot cherry and spice, it mellows somewhat into thin caramel and wood but that cherry spice stays with you. Kind of a nice finish actually for how hot and short it is.

*****

I don't hate it, but I don't love it. Which is funny, because back in my early Bourbon days that's exactly how I felt about standard Maker's Mark as I explored different Whiskies. Even as I developed a taste for stuff like Evan Williams I couldn't really see the appeal of the more ""premium"" Maker's Mark. So it seems fitting that this Cask Strength version would hold a similar place for me today. The big letdown for me is that as a big fan of WHEATERS, I was hoping for a bit more from a cask strength Wheated Bourbon. This doesn't do a lot for me in that regard. But it's still a decent Bourbon, and it's definitely an improvement over standard Maker's Mark.

I actually think this stuff is exceptional and complex. Possibly my favorite wheater under Lot B and pappy 15. Blows the pants off OWA and sits on every shelf
Is the 46 the better option?
I actually really enjoy Makers Cask, and I'm not a wheated bourbon fan. I'd take it easily all day long over OWA and 12. Rebell Yell 10yr as well, that and Makers Cask are the only wheaters I keep in the house.
So..... Uhhh.... Where can I get that monkey picture in the background?
This is a 9 or 10 every day of the week
Nice review. My experience was a little better, but this is not worth $55. If this were a $30 bottle I'd be all over it.
Very good product by MM. Get em while you can, on sale for $46. My bottle is magic  @ 111.5 p
Mine's been open at least 2 or 3 months now, I agree it has improved but it still just doesn't seem to totally come together for me. Glad you love yours so much though!
I feel like I need to revisit some whiskeys and give them some air after reading posts like this.
I had the same experience with 1792 FP.
I thought this was fantastic the second I opened the bottle.
I completely agree with your review. I was really hyped to try this out as I like wheaters and cask strength bourbon/ryes in general. I had also seen good reviews in general so I decided to pick one up.  Like you say, it‚Äôs not awful but it really fails to come together for me too. A lot of heat for 110 proof with some off mint and thin mouth feel notes. It‚Äôs just a ton of different flavors that don‚Äôt quite come together for me as well
I agree with your assessment and share you're disappointment. To me there is a clear off taste, some sort of astringency that really hurts it for me. I've since bought two bottles of Weller 107 and at first I didn't think they tasted similar at all, but after tasting next to each other I see they do have a similar profile, but the Weller 107 has the signature Buffalo trace barrel depth and sweetness, whereas Maker's has that glaring astringency that ruins it. And I managed to get OWA for $32 each, so it's far and away much better in quality and price than MMCS. I wish I could get over the astringency because it's so available, but it's just too prominent for me.
I had heard lots of good things, so you're not alone. And like I said I'm a big fan of wheated Bourbon including Weller 107 so I had high hopes. It's good but just seemed a little too hot and astringent. The bottle has been open for a few months now too, so I feel like I've given it a fair chance at this point. Just a weak batch maybe?
I used to like the 46 way more than standard MM, but I haven't had it in a long time now. I dont know if it could compete with a barrel proofer like this, but then again it is bottled at a decent 47% so who knows.
Yeah I really like Rebel Yell 10 also. But this and OWA seem to be very divisive Whiskies
I've had it so long I don't even remember where I got it. If you google ""monkey drinking poster"" lots of stuff comes up though.
That‚Äôs what I was thinking
Great poster!  I got mine from etsy.  https://www.etsy.com/listing/630475960/vintage-advertising-art-french-wall?ga_search_query=Drinking&ref=shop_items_search_4&pro=1&frs=1
And you get my upvote every day of the week! Man have I missed seeing you around haha. We need you more than ever
Yep. I know we snobs tend to use ""smooth is a bullshit compliment"" a lot, but it's kind of glaring when something is just needlessly hot like this is. I can handle a big hot explosion of flavor and spice like Stagg Jr or FRPS has, but this MM is just an ethanol burn to me that distracts from the flavor rather than adding to it.
Maybe grab another bottle when that one is done, and add a couple drops of water to your pour to see where that takes you. If you‚Äôre a large fan of 107 maybe the proof just isn‚Äôt speaking to you on this. Appreciate your review!
Yeah Rebell SiB is awesome, just wish it were easier to find now. You'll pretty much never see it in South FL. I either buy when travelling or one of the places I'll order from regularly has it (but $80).
Thanks man!
I'm drinking some right now with water, doesn't help a whole lot. It's good and it has mellowed it, but the flavor is just too muted now. I think I prefer it straight. And the proof wouldn't really be a problem for me, I enjoy plenty of stuff much stronger than this. Thanks for the suggestion though, and thanks for reading!"
"Review #94, Willett Rye(MGP) 4yr wax top #7 (done blind)",,https://i.redd.it/gvrwkljy07b31.jpg,"This was drank blind as a mystery sample from u/I_SAID_NO_GOLDFISH , who I then messaged for a reveal

*****

**Willett Family Estate Rye(MGP) 4 year wax top #7, 110 proof**

**Nose:** Creamy butterscotch, berry fruitiness, fresh stale wood, oaky spice, brash cherry. Water brings out some harsh mint and pine sol, lots of tannic oak.

**Taste:** Pretty hot and sharp on the palate with lots of hot cherry and cinnamon spice burn, kind of closed. A prime candidate for some water. It settles down with water but it's pretty washed out now :(. Caramel and Bourbon sweetness, faint creaminess, bitter oak, light cherry. Just not much going on, maybe the water was a mistake. I only added a 1/2 tsp, and it still wasn't all that enjoyable beforehand.

**Finish:** Picks up (a little) on the finish with some lively spice and brash cherry, creamy butterscotch. Leaves a stale oak flavor behind.

* I'm thinking that it wasn't as high proof as I first thought based on the initial taste, and that adding water was a mistake. But bottom line is it was hot and overly harsh and didn't have a lot of rewarding flavor to me, and I wouldn't have added the water in the first place if I was enjoying it. With the water it was a little boring, but eventually some nice creamy sweetness emerged even if it was a bit washed out. I'm thinking it was probably an overly hot 45-50% and the water just dropped the ABV too low. Don't have much of a guess, but it reminds me of some dusty stuff that you think is gonna be good because it's so old but then you're disappointed once you try it.

*****

**Post reveal thoughts:** It just felt like kind of a mess, then I added the water and it was all over. It was so watered down tasting after that, like I had taken it down to 40%. I only added a 1/2 tsp of water though. It was a weird one, maybe my tastes were just off that night. I was shook up from the earthquakes haha. Too bad because it is right up my alley. I usually love all things MGP Rye young or old, and the MGP Willetts have been some of my all time favorite Whiskey.

**Nose:** Rich and creamy but with plenty of brash sweetness. Loads of rich chocolate and vanilla with thick caramel, brash corn, sinus-numbing mint and smooth clean rye spice, some root beer char, nice fruitiness. Delicious and dynamic nose.

**Taste:** It's hot! Exactly what I love in these and exactly what I would expect from a 60% Bourbon. A burst of darkly sweet fruitiness then it settles into burnt toffee, black liquorice, metallic twang, toasted wood, smooth creamy vanilla, syrupy sweet cherry, zippy peppery spice, sweet corn. It holds onto some of that nicer vanilla and thick caramel richness from the nose, which smooths out the brash and action packed explosion of Four Roses flavor that I always love.  

**Finish:** A nice mouth numbing menthol that builds into a super spicy finish, big peppery and cinnamon Bourbon burn with pleasant, syrupy sweet cherry that rides out super long and sweet.

*****

This is a great Four Roses. It seems thicker and richer to me than these usually are, but that doesn't begin to tell the whole story since there's still lots of that typical explosion of brash flavors. The result is something really exciting yet very rich and balanced. Hard to put in words really, but it feels like often times FRPS's can be a cacophony of flavors that hit a bunch of good notes in a ""flurry of punches."" This feels a bit more expertly crafted and ""finished"" while still keeping that brash, dynamic character in tact.

Great review as usual my friend and some of those high proof four roses are nice :)
Got a 10yr old binny's OBSV recently that blew my socks off. Best four roses pick I've had thus far. You can tell why they make it the standard single barrel recipe
My favorite bourbon!
Bounty Hunter Wine. That‚Äôs the coolest.
Thanks dude! Always glad to hear from you. Yeah I've had really good experiences with high proof Four Roses, it's almost more consistent to me than any single recipe.

Btw, I'm still waiting for some WhistlePig reviews from you
Well one of my least favorite Four Roses was a 10yr OBSV from K&L, so it just goes to show you never know haha. Any kind of consistency as far as specific recipes has so far eluded me. But they are almost always delicious and even the worst I've had haven't been all that bad, so it's fun to keep trying them. 

I would love to try a Binny's pick though, I have liked all the stuff I've tried from them.
I see you have good taste! It's definitely some of my favorite stuff as well.
Hope u are doing good :) Did you had the 2013 LE SiB? Its a 60% OBSK.. crazy delicious. Agree.. but i haven‚Äòt had any young high proofers, did you? 
I‚Äòm writing pretty consistent my reviews but very lazy to type them up here :( my whistlepig lineup is not yet done.. but i did a huge mgp bourbon lineup :)
>  Did you had the 2013 LE SiB? Its a 60% OBSK

I have a sample of that I think, it's 59.9%. But I then I've had another that was 60.3%, so I'm confused. I have a whole slew of Small Batch and SiB LE samples I've acquired, some from you I think. Maybe I should do a series.
Yes, I think mine was 60.3% I loved it :) You should absolutely do this. Have u had the 130th smb? If yes how did u like it?
No I haven't tried it, values just got too crazy on the stuff and it got hard to swap for samples. When people start valuing stuff too high it just kind of turns me off from even trying it. I only have 5 or 6 LE samples, they're all 2013-2016.
Lets talk on the other site ;)
I wonder if its the same binnys obsv 10 yr that I picked up a month or so ago and have been looking for another since."
"Some rum my uncle found at an estate sale, anyone have more info?",,https://i.redd.it/of9p3vduyx931.jpg,"I'm not a rum expert but I've dabbled a little, it's pretty rich and oaky and not as sickly sweet as other rum I've had. Its really good.

Some more pics: https://imgur.com/gallery/QGb6syW

EDIT: I'm still drinking this right now, it's so good. Very rich like maple syrup, molasses and oak. The sweetness is so mellow, I like this stuff.
That‚Äôs a classic naval rum most famous for its inclusion in the classic painkiller cocktail.

As I remember the recipe is
2/3/4 oz of pussers (depending on your level of pain)
4 parts Pineapple juice
1 parts Cream of coconut
1 part orange juice
Nutmeg grated on top

Edit : just realized this is a much higher proof than normal pussers!
I imagine it‚Äôs just a stronger concentration of their mainstay
This rum is near and dear to my heart.
I live in Annapolis and Pusser‚Äôs is really popular here due to the navy‚Äôs presence. There‚Äôs a bar here that I guess is owned by the brand, because it‚Äôs called Pusser‚Äôs and they use the rum in their drinks. You can buy the rum in fancy decanters like this in their gift shop and at a few other stores in town, but I‚Äôve never seen a 1.75L jug before. Very cool, it‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs chipped at the top.
Everyone else in the thread has explained British Navy rum already so I‚Äôll just say that if you like this you should try the Pussers 15! One of my all time favourite rums.
Oh Pusser's Rum.  First time I went to England I was in a pub for breakfast and the bartender told the group I was with a story of Admiral Pusser and his rum. 

Admiral Pusser hated pirates but loved rum. He had his own special recipe made and had a bottle on his person at all times. His ship always had extra room to carry his personal barrels. When he died of old age, years after retirement, he was cremated and his ashes were placed in a bottle of his rum and he was buried at sea. 

We drank the rum and toasted Admiral Pusser.

A few years later I saw the rum again and decided to look up the story.  All complete BS made up to get us to buy a shot of rum.
That jug is fantastic! Very cool!
Just recently picked it up myself because it was novel and cheap. I'm really surprised how good it is.
Pushers is the OG. Great short video on YouTube about it, but no, I‚Äôm not going to find the link
The decanter is collector ! You can refill it after drinking the rum
I hear its rubbish. Do yourself a favour and send it to me for correct disposal.
I'm quite a newbie to rum myself but read some old thread here just the other day discussing what rum today would be the closest to what pirates were drinking back in the days.. I remember this one being mentioned as one of the contenders.
Pusser's is a pretty decent British style rum, famously used in the Painkiller cocktail. The rum has a British naval heritage, but I don't believe it has anything to do with the British Navy today (or for several decades.)

The name comes from the fact that until a bit over 50 years ago, a naval sailor's daily rations included a measure of rum. You'd get it from the purser (which ""pusser"" is a lazy pronunciation of) each day. Back in the wooden ship days, you'd mix your rum with water and (if you had it) lime, which would make grog.

This is also where ""proof"" comes from. They would ""prove"" the rum by mixing it with gunpowder, and if you could light it on fire, it was proven to be strong enough. (The scale was set so that 100 proof would burn, but they weren't very accurate, rum actually needs to be 114 proof to ignite.)
So what do you mean by naval rum? Literally just stuff they would drink in the British navy?
>it‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs chipped at the top.

That actually happened at the estate sale that my uncle bought this at. It was a completely cherry bottle, sealedcand everything. Someone in front of him chipped the dang bottle and passed it up. My uncle bought it for $5, still sealed. Great deal I think
Hahahaha, thank you for that, this story is awesome
Interesting, got a link?
Very interesting, thanks for all the info. Incidentally I'm a big fan of Bourbon and old grandad makes a 114 proof bottling.
Under the old British measurement system 100 proof did equal 57 percent alcohol by volume.  Smith and Cross bottles their rum at this strength.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol\_proof#United\_Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_proof#United_Kingdom)
Yup!
[deleted]
Navy strength relates to any spirit, typically  rum, with a minimum ABV of 57% or 114 Proof, at which said spirit could douse gun powder and it still be lit. This particular rum is 95.5 proof or, 42.75% and is delicious, if you can find the 15 year, it's amazing!!
I'm not sure calling navy rum has too much significance (as far as regulated labeling goes)  Naval strength rum is 114 proof by definition as that is the minimum proof you can pour on gunpowder and still ignite it.
$5...!? What a find!
Ha! So if it wasn‚Äôt chipped you wouldn‚Äôt be drinking it. $5 for a big jug of good rum is awesome.
Ok I went back down that rabbit hole again and I probably remembered that name from here

https://www.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/61xkvj/what_kind_of_rum_would_actual_pirates_have_drunk/


Maybe not exactly as I remembered it ""what pirates drank"" but more like what they'd have drunk after looting a british naval vessel, as mentioned above.
So do they make bottlings exclusively for the navy, like its issued to sailors officially? Is it available for consumers too? Is this any kind of special bottling? 

Sorry for the barrage of questions, I really dont know anything about the subject.

IIRC the British navy would issue some quantity of rum to its sailors on a regular basis, too lazy to Google it. That practice has ended but Pussers still calls itself Navy Rum because of that heritage. Pussers has a standard offering, a 12 (?) year old offering, and a ""Gunpowder Strength"" higher proof offering, which is what you have there it seems, although I've never seen a porcelain crock of it. It's all good stuff.

You're welcome, it's an interesting topic. I haven't tried any yet but some navy rum is definately on the top of my shopping list. 

I got to the thread posted above from here https://www.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/bwe7gs/looking_for_a_rum_that_makes_me_feel_like_a_pirate/ where there's also links to some other threads on the matter if you want to read more on it as well. :)
Yeah, and they didn't stop this practice until sometime in the 70's.  It seems awesome to me because while I can totally imagine it sometime way back in the olden days, it seems crazy in the modern era to give your professiinal navy sailors a daily booze ration.
Also, the word ""grog"" comes from the same tradition, IIRC it was named after the coat of the guy that first made them start watering down the daily ration.  Grog was also the vehicle for scurvy preventing limes.

"At 62.3% this Glen Scotia is pretty hot, but instead of water I added...Clynelish!",,https://i.redd.it/e70uoxoz70931.jpg,"Ok so I added water too. Made for a good mix though! 

The Glen Scotia is a 12yr refill sherry at 62.3% that is SUPER funky and briny. It's delicious stuff but I thought it might be fun to mellow it out with something malty, and this 10yr Bourbon Barrel Clynelish at 57.9% fit the bill. 

I'm very happy with the results, it calmed down the Scotia without sacrificing the crazy flavor and kept it nice and thick and malty. I want to experiment with this some more, maybe using other malty Scotches.

u/Hmm4
Sounds great! I have some Glen Scotia so.... I'll give that mix a go. I keep trying to create a poor boys Brora -something really smoky and a nice Clynelish. Fun to experiment. So I just picked up a couple bottles of the new Cairdeas. Saw the review from CigarinmyAnus ( or whatever, great response to Texacer BTW). Sounds like it is pretty good. Can't wait to crack one open. Maybe ""crack"" isn't quite the right word in this case, LOL.
Finally seeing your creative contribution a little late.  I use Clynelish 14 as 'the handyman's secret weapon.'  Its all-around balance and oiliness (waxiness to some) helps calm down a fiery or overproofed scotch, and a little peps up a bland bourbon.
No problem, better late than never! That makes sense, because I think compass box and other blenders use it quite a bit too. Honestly I mainly used it because it's a scotch I'm not crazy about so I want to use it up. And it still has a nice middle of the road maltiness that I thought might help."
"Review #92, New Riff Rye",,https://i.redd.it/0jbfm1s82y831.jpg,"This stuff is bottled in bond, being distilled in 2015 and aged for ""at least 4 years"" before being bottled in 2019 at 50% and with no chill filtration. But the thing I was most excited about is that it has a 100% Rye mashbill (95% Rye and 5% malted Rye). 

*****

**New Riff Rye, bottled in bond, 50%**

**Nose:** It's mellow, sleek and dark. Mellow and minty Rye, spearmint gum, dark burnt caramel, orange, darkly charred and toasted wood. Very nice Rye nose

**Taste:** Some brash Whiskey heat that settles down into hot cinnamon, dark syrupy caramel, black cherry, mellow cool mint, black liquorice, light Rye spice. It's a dark and mellow Rye, kind of closed with not nearly as much bright/spicy Rye flavor as I would like. I think that's just personal preference though.

**Finish:** Some light Rye spice and cool mellow mintiness with plenty of dark and toasted flavor, leaves with hot spirit flavor

*****

This is a good dark and mellow Rye, I just tend to prefer my Rye more vibrant and spicy/brash I think. Definitely feels like it's on a higher level than other young craft distilleries I've had, it's good and has a very cohesive and balanced mouthfeel. I'm still excited about there being a new Rye on the market with a 100% mashbill, and this is good for what it is, but I'm holding out for something from them in the future that I hopefully enjoy more. But I'm also looking forward to seeing how the rest of this bottle plays out.

I am the same way when it comes to rye
Can we also give points for a beautiful bottle? That thing jumps off the shelf at you.
Always looking for a new bottle to try.  Worth the price? (In USA)
Saw this is Its Bourbon Night today and thought it looked interesting!
I just went on this tour today! Thought it was a great and extremely drinkable rye coming out of a neat smaller distillery. That bottle design is pretty slick as well.
Great review. I tried this for the first time a few days ago. You're profile of it is spot on. 

I tried the straight bourbon version too. That was a bit more spicy compared to other straight bourbons with the pronounced hot cinnamon flavor you mentioned. I prefer things a bit smoother than New Riff, but it was a solid 5 on your scale.
Also tried this, did not love it. 5 seems fair on your scale.
Wish I could find this in a bar just so I can compare it to all the SiB Ryes I‚Äôve picked up in the last month. I‚Äôm totally loving them. Some of my favorites out currently.
I‚Äôd probably put this at a 6 with a bullet (can‚Äôt wait to see this stuff in 2+ years). Very impressive stuff out the gate from New Riff. Makes me forget all about that fading star out in Utah...
I'd say $50-$60 this seems to go for(I didn't actually pay retail for this) is plenty worth it. That's a little pricey compared to other stuff on the shelves but I think it's worth it to support a quality distillery that is releasing stuff right with a proper age and ABV on it. Not to mention the fact that it's BiB and NCF.
I can get it for about $50 out the door and I think that‚Äôs a fair price. Perhaps a half step behind the Pikesvilles, Rendezvous Ryes and Russell‚Äôs Reserve Ryes of the shelf, but better than just about everything else. This is a bottle I‚Äôll gladly  buy over and over because it‚Äôs a great pour neat, an awesome base in a whiskey forward cocktail and a brand I would like to shovel my money towards to see what‚Äôs next. If you‚Äôre used to buying $50 bottles, give it a shot, it will not disappoint.
I think that objectively speaking a 6 might be fair here, I just have really high standards and specific tastes when it comes to Rye. I like them bright and spicy and fierce. And anyway I might be nitpicking but the flavor is a bit ""closed,"" I like when a Whiskey jumps out of the glass a bit more if that makes sense.

At least this wasn't a Bourbony Rye though, as a Rye fiend those go straight to my shitlist
What's happening to (I assume) High West? Don't they have a new distillery and whatnot??
Their Barrel Strength Single Barrel Ryes are awesome, I'd put them at an 8/8.5 on this scale.
For the curious, what would you say is a bourbony rye?
High standards are the way to go. When anyone writes a review, I‚Äôm expecting the dram to be nitpicked to death. I think the nose and mouthfeel on this are awesome. The flavor is definitely lacking some pop that I‚Äôve come to expect (and love) in most ryes but is well rounded. Maybe I‚Äôm loving on this too much because of ‚Äònew distillery doing things the right way‚Äô or because what could come of this since this is only a 4 year product or because it‚Äôs 100% rye, $50 and on the shelf, but I think I‚Äôm even keel leaning towards a 6 but that‚Äôs just me! Nice review by the way!!!
Maybe it‚Äôs all between my ears, but over the past few years, the Rendezvous Rye seems to have gone downhill a bit. The rest of their lineup seems tired and a bit underwhelming...
So stoked I got a pair of these. First ones great. Second one is in the wings...
Most 51% Rye I've had just isn't Rye enough for my tastes. Wild Turkey Rye comes to mind, Knob Creek Rye, Rittenhouse, Old Overholt. It's not that I don't like them, they just don't satisfy my Rye itch. 

Mileage can vary sometimes though for sure. I've had ""B"" recipe Four Roses Private Selects(35% Rye) that taste like a straight up Rye, and I did really like the Knob Creek Cask Strength Rye even though I'm not crazy about their standard and single barrel Ryes.

It's been a while since I've had some of that stuff I listed so I could be remembering wrong, and I'm sure there's some other stuff that I'm forgetting.
Thanks, and thanks for reading.

> The flavor is definitely lacking some pop that I‚Äôve come to expect (and love) in most ryes but is well rounded.

That's basically how I feel too, maybe I'm just a little harsher on it lol. I enjoyed Willett's 4yr Rye a lot more, but maybe it's not a fair comparison because it is small batch and full proof. There's no doubt that this is a solid Rye though.
It's not between your ears. RR used to be a hefty amount of 16yr barton & 6yr MGP at $38. Now it's ~$60 for a ratio that is...something else but clearly not what it once was. The RR CS finished barrel picks were excellent and all around $60. The 21 and 16 ryes were delightful. Perkins is still the shit, but we all knew this couldn't last.
> The rest of their lineup seems tired and a bit underwhelming

It's also a bit overpriced, which is why I haven't bothered to try most of it.
Definitely agree with WT Rye. Makes sense given the purported mash bill is 51% Rye, 37% Corn, 12% Barley.

I also love the Knob Creek Cask Strength Rye and don't really love their regular bourbon or rye offerings.
I‚Äôve had one willett 4yr Rye and it didn‚Äôt thrill me. Too many people have recommended it that I gotta find another.
Yeah people go crazy for that wild Turkey 101 rye around here, but I remember when I first tried it I was just like *yawn*"

**Nose:** Rich and woody. Deeply toasted and slightly bitter wood, char, black cherry, tobacco, vanilla, earthy and musty fresh wood. That deep, balanced, smooth oakiness that reminds me of older Wild Turkey I've had, although a little more tannic and bitter.

**Taste:** A low simmering black cherry fruitiness with mild spice, tobacco, rich toasted wood, burnt caramel, brash corn sweetness, vanilla. Still plenty of deliciously smooth and balanced Wild Turkey wood but it's also quite fruity and action packed.

**Finish:** Smooth chocolatey wood that surprisingly brightens up into hot cherry, corn sweetness, and nice Bourbon spice. Very fun finish for such a smooth and oaky Bourbon.

*****

A delicious single barrel of Wild Turkey. Wonderful flavor that feels so balanced and effortless but without sacrificing complexity, it's a quality I love in older Wild Turkey and that I find a lot in the Russel's Reserve SiB's. Tons of big toasted oak but plenty of sweet and spicy action too, this is simply the definition of Bourbon to me.

These pre-2010s WTKSes are so good. I still have a couple hoarded away from my bourbon-hunting days.
Reviews like this make me sad I didn't get into bourbon earlier!
I have one from 2011. I get juicy fruit gum from it. It‚Äôs wild!
Monkey on the poster in the background has the right idea!  Bottoms up!
Yup, I love these.  People squee over Pewter Top (never lucked out and found one I could afford) but these 2000's WTKS can be wonderful birds.
Agreed. I had this one and a 2006 stashed away, I just really felt like opening one for 4th of July. I have quite a few WT-03RB's as well, I usually need some kind of dusty Turkey open even if they aren't all that old or special. Just really delicious stuff. 

Luckily I feel like a good Russels Reserve store pick can still scratch that Turkey itch pretty well for me.
Anyone ever grab a store pick of WTKS? I saw a 2015 store pick for $55 that I passed on for RR Single Barrel instead, but debating on going back to grab it now.
I do know the feeling. I've found a few goodies on shelves but mostly I got lucky with some good swaps.
I‚Äôve got that poster too!
Hell I never looked for WTKS when I could as I was too busy getting Tradition and 12 year. Now you can‚Äôt find the damn things and I‚Äôm not sure trading or buying is really worth it
Do as the monkey does!  Bottoms up!  Lol!
It‚Äôs one of the dusty WTs that‚Äôs not too crazy expensive on the secondary. And I have found a couple of old bottles (07, 08) on the shelves.
I don‚Äôt think you missed much. Old WTKS has always been rather rare in Japan. I never saw a good deal on a pewter top or other WTKS from the 90s.
Any recommendations for years or bottles? Tokyo is pretty picked over
I wonder why that is. There‚Äôs an abundance of Rare Breed/1855 and one would think that WTKS would be just as popular but it really isn‚Äôt. I have always picked Tradition over WTKS and I guess I‚Äôll keep doing so.

Are you still collecting date codes and what not?
I've seen WTKS as old as '12 here, but the older bottles I found were actually back in the States.  I think the key with WTKS is pre-2010 or so, as that gets you barrels from before the entry proof increase.

I haven't found anything really good in Japan on the shelf, actually.  All the bargains I've found have been on Yahoo auctions, but even those are mostly a thing of the past since prices have massively increased in the last six months.  You do see 2000's WTKS bottles pop up there sometimes though, and they don't usually go for a fortune.  The closest thing to a real bargain you can still find on Yahoo if you‚Äôre patient and lucky is dusty Blanton‚Äôs.  And the best QPR among WT is probably 99 Rare Breed.
The only outstanding issue for dates is when WT12 changed from pseudo-split label. I think it happened sometime around 2003, but I‚Äôve not been able to track it down definitely.
Holy shit dude, I‚Äôve been meaning to ask someone, what the fuck happened to yahoo auction? The prices are insane now! Fucking 8 year for 15000 yen is crazy. Also I‚Äôve seen a ton of auctions that are Áúå limited for shipping. What‚Äôs going on??
Let me check all of my bottles and ill get back to you tomorrow all of my pseudo splits are 2000-2002.
I actually dont have anything from 2003 until 2008-2010 and then nothing after that either. 

BTW have you seen the date codes on the euro export 33.33Cl bottles? its like nothing I have ever seen.
As best I can tell, JP stopped shipping to the U.S. and it depressed prices. Then they started doing it again.
Ah I see. Damn."
"Review #100, Brora 35 (2013 release)",,https://i.redd.it/2u34nl4ifm731.jpg,"I wasn't gonna do anything special for my 100th review, just drink whatever Scotch I felt like really. But I got to thinking that I've already had this sample for 6 months now, and if I don't open it now then when? I didn't want it to be something that ended up sitting around undrank forever because I was too afraid to open it up. So fuck it, here's #100!

This sample(along with a few other zingers) was an amazingly generous secret santa gift from u/Marcovici, and I am eternally grateful.

*****

**Brora 1977 35 year, 2013 release, refill American oak/European oak, 49.9%**

**Nose:** Robust yet delicate, a rich and complex nose that unfolds beautifully and doesn't assault you. Rich honey and caramel, wonderful floral notes that aren't perfumy at all, some nice wood funk, beautiful clean vanilla, bright lemon, sugar pastry, waxy and malty, tangy fruit. Really nice richer wood notes that come out with some air, clean toasted wood char and light chocolate. Amazingly balanced and pleasant

**Taste:** My god, this is beautiful. It hits the tongue and just sings. Rich honey and vanilla, wonderful tangy fruit, super thick waxy malt, and it just keeps building richer and brighter. Caramel, clean tangy fruit and pear, sweet pastry, happy sugar barley, a huge waxy and fruity maltiness, sweet vanilla, bright and sweet floral notes. I've never experienced such perfectly executed floral notes in a Scotch, they always seem borderline perfumy and astringent to me. This is like drizzling rich honey and thick, waxy malt on a field of flowers in heaven and then perfectly aging it in a barrel. I feel like I could go on with these cheesy analogies all day lol, Every sip is just so beautiful.

**Finish:** It explodes on the tongue and keeps burning brightly sweet and pleasant long after each sip. Sweet vanilla icing, barley sugar, light pleasant fruitiness, more of of that amazing floral quality. Such a long and pleasant finish.

*****

I don't know what else I can say. This stuff is just amazing, there's not a sour note or shortcoming to be found here. A perfect Scotch experience. I hesitate to use the word ""balanced"" alone because that feels so boring. It certainly is complex and balanced, but it's so much more than that. Every sip is pure Scotch pleasure, it just sings in the nose and on the palate. It's huge and rich yet brightly sweet and nimble. It doesn't necessarily hit any notes that I haven't had in other Scotches before, but it seems to hit them all to perfection and then combine them beautifully. Sometimes it seems like there's a lot of hype surrounding Whiskeys that can't quite deliver, it's nice to drink something that totally lives up to it's name.

Congratulations!! Awesome review, thanks for sharing!! This sounds divine!
Cheers! Glad you enjoyed it. Definitely one of my favorites.
Congratulations on the 100th and what a scotch to boot! This sounds amazing.
Appropriate background picture. Also appropriate to have a perfect 10 to review, even though it's way out of most viewers price range.
Oof. Nice hundredth review with a Brora.
I really need to get to reviewing more of my shit lol
Brora is my favorite, next to Ardbeg. Have been lucky enough to try several, though most have been IBs. The younger ones tend to be a bit farmier, one of my personal favorites was an 81 signatory that was crazy with the ""wet dog"" profile that you tend to find in these broras.
Rock n roll! Congrats on #100, love your reviews dude. This sounds absolutely delightful. The only Brora I've had was heavily peated, so I'd love to try one of the unpeated ones like this one.
Wonderful review, thanks for busting this out for #100! Anything a little more wallet friendly that this compares to?
Congrats on the milestone! This one is awesome.
Cheers, and thanks again fo the chance to experience this elixir. Have you had many different broras? If so, how does this one compare?
Thanks dude, and it really is. I'm so glad I decided to go for it. I've never been blown away by older scotch for how much money it costs, this has really made me reconsider that. I feel like maybe I just haven't had the right stuff and I need to check out some older bittlings.
Thanks dude! And I would likewise love to try a peated Brora. Or another unpeated, any Brora really lol. 

Actually I forgot that Brora only made a peated Scotch for a small window (69-73), and was expecting peat when I drank this. I was pleasantly surprised, but also really trying to see if I was missing some peat notes for a while. It ended up being so good it really didn't matter anyway.
You're welcome, and thanks for reading. 

>Anything a little more wallet friendly that this compares to?

I don't know, but if you find anything be sure to let me know! It has elements of other fantastic malty scotches I've had, but like I said in my review it just executes them to a level of perfection I've never tasted before. This is also by far the oldest scotch I've ever had, the next oldest I've tried that was a proper cask strength bottling was probably low 20's. So maybe I just need to explore older scotch more.
Unfortunately to get those old whisky notes of complex perfumes, woods, honeys, sugars, florals you need to get old whisky. 

The closest thing as far as something that is more wallet friendly would be 20+ year old bourbon cask Ben Nevis. But that only imitates some of these old whisky notes.
Thanks, and yeah it really is
So have you had this bottling before, or any other Brora? I'm curious how this compares to other Broras if you have.

I know u/troyk890 is pretty experienced with this stuff too, paging him with the same question.
Older scotch is just different. Some amazing and some, meh. Age and maybe better casks? I'm starting to look at older IB's but it comes down to disposable income.... I have a Signatory 1989 Glenturret, bourbon cask that is really amazing and at $225, it is worth it.
The 38yo 2016 release I felt was excellent but I wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell it from a mid-age Clynelish- gave it 86 I think.

The 2004 30yo was epic.

And I‚Äôve tried a 1974 Clynelish that was definitely mislabelled that was just as good.
$225 is about the most I've ever spent on a bottle, and even that was only a few times. I just feel like after $200 the price to quality ratio drops too much. If I could find more stuff like this brora though my opinion might change. We've talked about this before, how more and more I seem to buy less bottles these days that simply cost more.
I just got a 1989 Signatory Glenturret 29yr and god dam is it good. Those old Signatory bottles can be gems!
I have the same sentiment on diminishing returns past $200.
yea, $225 was a stretch. Above 200 it had better be good. I'm starting to go for quality over quantity though, but damn, a Clynelish for $50? I'm in! I've had Brora once. It was a visit to the Clynelish distillery. There were only 3 of us that stayed and did the extended tasting ( why not? ) After the tasting we wanted to try a Brora but at 30(pounds) we thought we would split one. They gave us each one and then another. We had a 30 year old bottled in 2004 and a 35 bottled in 2014. They were amazing but after the first 3 other drams my taste buds were a bit fuzzy. I would love to sit down, take my time and really appreciate another Brora. Binnys has one for 1300 but that's way out of my league.
Nice! Older Glenturret is really amazing. I‚Äôve got a 1989 Signatory bottling of one as well. My quest is find older Signatory bottlings, roll the dice so to speak. 2nd dram of the Dailuaine, getting more interesting. Cheers and Happy fourth!
Damn that tasting sounds amazing. And 30 pounds doesn't even sound that bad for a chance like that, I understand though with a big trip like that costs were pry piling up. 

>Binnys has one for 1300 but that's way out of my league.

I 100% agree with you, but I'm telling you that the first thing I did after drinking this Brora was look at $1000-$1500 bottlings and think ""well shit maybe I *can* swing it"" Haha. I'm sure I'll come to my senses, but it's just that good. Maybe if I could find the same bottling I tried I might consider a split or something, but that's too much to risk on an unknown bottle.
I know, right? When I've had a dram or 2 I look at prices and think the same thing - I could swing that, then I sober up. Luckily one shouldn't drive when you've been drinking, for obvious reasons but also saves me from making some interesting purchases. I remember around 6-7 years ago on TWE website you could purchase Brora for about 350 - those days are gone. There's a lot of good whisky out there for much less, keep looking, constant vigilance. IB's can be gems. 

All said, 100 is quite a milestone. That's a lot of reviews. Now the journey continues and on to 200!"
"Review #90, Willett 4yr Small Batch Rye (done blind)",,https://i.redd.it/amqkrurij0731.jpg,"I drank this blind as a mystery sample from u/Chardogg

*****

**Willett 4 year Small Batch Rye, 107.2/53.6% (done blind)**

**Nose:** Tons of butterscotch! Also peanuts, herbal spice, brash cherry, musty caramel, wood funk, big barrel char and toasted wood, menthol. Just a huge, thick nose on this stuff, really good. 

**Taste:** Thick and really smooth, a lot of big flavor here. Peanut and rich caramel, butterscotch, maple, hot brash cherry and spice, rich smooth toasted wood that isn't remotely charred or tannic.

**Finish:** It leaves sweet and spicy with cherry cough syrup, toasted wood, butterscotch, and lots of nice Bourbon spice

*****

This tastes unique and so dang familiar, I can't put my finger on it though. Really enjoyed this. It tastes like a lowish barrel proof right around 50% with a heavy butterscotch/peanut thing going on and a healthy dose of spice. My first impulse was a Knob Creek Single Barrel. The more I drank it I kind of talked myself out of that, and it doesn't drink like it's 60%, but that's about as good of a guess as I can come up with.

Score: **7**

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** Awesome, I've been wanting to try this stuff! Reading my notes it totally reads like a review of a Rye Whiskey. All the delicious spice and creamy richness should have clued me in, but I guess I'm just too used to the fiercer WP and MGP stuff. This was a great one to do blind too, because as a huge Rye fiend I just would have been asking myself ""is this Rye enough?"" the whole time. But it was awesome being able to judge this on it's own merits, and boy did I like it. Really amazing for being only 4 years old too, these guys might be onto something.

Snagged a 111 proof 4 year. Damn good stuff.
Just picked up my first bottle. Can‚Äôt wait to try it!
My favorite bottle of rye to date.  Absolutely a great pour -- I've had two bottles from two batches, one 110.2 and another 109.8.  It is spectacular whiskey.  Your review is spot on for what I taste.
The bottle I have is 113.8 Proof and damn if it‚Äôs not deceptively smooth. 

When I tasted it I thought ‚ÄúWerther‚Äôs Original.‚Äù

This particular bottle (the ones at work come in around 109) is probably my favorite whiskey I‚Äôve ever had. Truly remarkable. 

When I made a Sazerac with it was like... the first time I ever had a Sazerac.
So often I hear that new ""craft"" distilleries are at a disadvantage because they don't have the capital to wait 6-10 years for their product to mature before starting sales. Yet Willett has incredibly sought after product that is only 3 to 4 years age statement? Is it just harder to get such full flavor when young, but they somehow succeed or is there more to it?
My 4 year has tons of dill on the nose and palate...the 3 had way more. I really enjoyed both and am hoping to see the 5 yr. one day. Pricey for what it is, but I like what Willett is doing with their rye.
Such a good bottle, one of my favorites. Current one is the 111 proof batch.
This stuff is my absolute favorite. So rich and delicious. Takes a little searching to find bottles but well worth it.
I didn‚Äôt see any Willett Rye in your prior reviews so figured it would be the perfect mystery for a rye lover.  The Willett and MGP Whistlepigs are my go to ryes these days. these willetts will just keep getting better.  Hopefully they release a 5 year Rye soon as I believe the 4 years have been out for almost a year.
I wasn't aware that there were different batches with the same age, but apparently there are. And I guess the proof is the only way to distinguish them. Glad you liked yours, and thanks for reading
I also have the 111 and it's fantastic.
They made a really good name for themselves for years by sourcing excellent Whiskey from other distilleries. I think the Willett name was able to ride on that recognition and success, but luckily they are coming through with their own quality stuff now. I dont know what their system or aging process is like over there, but they seem to be doing something right.
Ryes are easier to pull off ""young"", and in Willets case they happen to have their process down pat and perfected with the 4yr. Look at Peerless as an example, their stuff cost much more yet their Rye is awful in comparison. Young bourbon otoh is generally mehhh, pry why so many craft distillers are trying to push out young Ryes as fast as they can. Problem is most don't have a good formula for the juice at least at young ages.
Yeah this was a great sample to do blind, thank you much 

I would add the Alberta WP store picks too, I love that stuff. I dont sweat whether a WP pick is Cananda or MGP, it all seems to be delicious stuff. MGP still puts out some barrel proof stuff here and there too.
Yeah I‚Äôve seen 2 in TN so far. 109 and 111 I think. I‚Äôm super stoked to see what happens in the next few years with willet and their own distillate!
i've got two bottles of 126 proof
Same here. Looks like we scored on the extra proof!"
"Review #15, Lot 40 Cask Strength 11yr, 2nd edition",,https://i.redd.it/3omwxja3ct631.jpg,"**Lot 40 Cask Strength Rye 11 year, 2nd edition, 58.4%**

**Nose:** Right off the bat this announces itself as a proper Rye. Big herbal rye spice, rich caramel, tons of sharp dill, wintergreen, chocolate, pepper, delicious toasted wood, root beer char, mint

**Taste:** Cool mint and big herbal rye hits first, with a nice peppery spice. I know MGP Rye has a reputation for dill, but they got nothing on this stuff which has tons of very clean and crisp dill. Cinnamon red hot, Rich maple and caramel, fresh wintergreen, fruity cherry, dill, rich toasted wood with delicious char. There's definitely no confusing this stuff with a Bourbon, which is exactly how I like my Rye.

**Finish:** Huge spicy finish. Cinnamon red hots, cherry cough syrup, chocolate, mint, and then delicious dill and peppery rye spice that lingers for a long time.

*****

I'm a total Rye fiend, and I often say how much I hate a Bourbony Rye. When I'm drinking a Rye I want it to taste like a Rye damnit! And boy does this stuff hit that mark. An excellent Whiskey with tons of Rye goodness. Between this and WhistlePig store picks it seems like Canada can make some pretty excellent stuff, it just sucks that proper high-Rye mashbills like this can be so expensive and hard to find.

Good review, glad you got a chance to try this one. 

&#x200B;

Probably my favourite Canadian rye, I preferred this second batch over the first Lo 40 cask strength (what can I say, I'm a fan of dill). The Whistlepig comparison is interesting - I also quite enjoy Masterson's (same juice as original Whistlepig, just not extra aged). Another good bold rye, from a completely different producer.
>what can I say, I'm a fan of dill

You've got to be to like this stuff, but yeah I am too haha. I actually remember liking the 1st edition slightly more, but it was just a 2oz sample so I wasn't able to give it as good of a chance as this one. They are both excellent though really

I've had Mastersons, but it was years ago. I liked it but I was just too inexperienced to really give it a fair shake at the time, it would be interesting to revisit. Who makes it? I don't know much about it.
Masterson's 10yo rye is the same juice as Whistlepig 10yo rye - both are made by Alberta Distillers. Difference is Whistlepig does additional local finishing for their various products (and now starting to incorporate their own juice too). Export only, aged in virgin oak (unusual in Canada). Sadly, none of it is bottled here in Canada. Which is a shame, as it means we pay import duties (built-into the price) when we buy either here in Canada.

It's a different profile to the Lot 40 CS made by Corby in Ontario, due to larger proportion of virgin oak used in Masterson's/Whistlepig. All are 100% unmalted rye, but I expect there are differences in the distillation."
"Review #99, Laphroaig Select",,https://i.redd.it/m8rdm8bdfm631.jpg,"They left in on the counter for ya mate.
Wait now, you‚Äôre house sitting for a friend, you took their bird home and you thought why not their whisky too?
‚ÄúNose: Bandaid‚Äù what..... haha
I'm house sitting for a friend(hence the the bird in the background) and I saw this on the counter, thought I would take it home for a dram and a review. I mean they didn't tell me *not* to. 

According to the tube this is ""selected"" from all their different casks of Quarter Cask, PX, and Triple Wood European oak before being finished for 6 months in new American Oak. I only know it as Laphroaig's cheapest and lowest ABV bottle. 

*****

**Laphroaig Select, 40%**

**Nose:** Maybe a little light, but there's still plenty of Laphroaig goodness on the nose. Big medicinal peat, bandaids, light caramel, barrel char, lemon, vanilla

**Taste:** Sweet and light with very mild smoke, definitely tastes a bit watered down. Light caramel and smoke, smooth wood, lemon, sweet vanilla. It's pretty good, just doesn't offer a lot for someone used to higher ABV or bigger flavor. Tastes like Laphroaig Lite.

**Finish:** Some briny smoke and sweet vanilla, very light lingering phenolic mouthfeel. There wasn't much punch on the taste, and there's even less on the finish.

*****

Not as bad as I thought. No ethanol burn or young hot mess here, it's just a standard sweetish Laphroaig that got watered down. It's a shame because it sounds like it has an interesting aging process and I bet it would be delicious at a higher ABV. I would say maybe it's a good introduction to Laphroaig or peated Scotch that isn't too aggressive, but I feel like the 10 year already does that just fine. Kind of a pointless bottle imo, but it's good and it didn't replace anything better so I guess there's nothing to be up in arms about.

Had this the other night at the bar. I'd give it maybe a 5 on your scale, but otherwise completely agree.
I like the way you think
That's how interpreted this too haha
The bird was better off here so I could feed it and cover the cage at night. Taking the Whisky was a totally opportunistic crime, I'll return it tomorrow with just a wee dram missing haha.
Lots of people get a medicinal quality out of Laphroaig, like the smell of a doctor's office. I personally like to describe Laphroaig as a hospital fire.
LOL, fair enough. Compared to other Laphroaig‚Äôs, it sounds a bit lacking but overall it sounds pretty decent for an entry level. Just wondering if you gave it a lower rating  because Laphroaig 10 is so good and about the same price?
Yeah it's pretty good as an entry level bottle. It's just too watered down and weak, it definitely would have scored higher at 43-46%. I'm pretty jaded and used to cask strength at this point as you know, so I could see someone newer to scotch enjoying it a lot more. 

It's definitely not swill like lots of other 40% entry level stuff(looking at you Auchentoshan American oak).
Agreed, Laphroaig is so good they‚Äôve set a high bar. I‚Äôll pass on this one ‚ÄúLaphroaig lite‚Äù says it all. I‚Äôll avoid the Auchentoshan American Oak as well."
Question about my succulent,,https://i.redd.it/0jrmo3d3g5631.jpg,"Some pics https://imgur.com/gallery/X1FYBmx

First off, I should say that I'm far from knowledgeable on plants and succulents, I have a couple that I manage to keep alive in my house is all. And I'm beating myself up because when I transplanted this thing I threw away the container with the name on it, hopefully that's not a problem for some of you here.

Anyway, my question is about the little buds on the strange vine/stem growing right out of the middle of this thing. A friend suggested that I might get seeds from it, is this true? They seem to open up into almost some kind of flower but never fully ""bloom."" They leave behind a bunch of little pieces of fuzz and a sticky residue, and now one has wilted and fallen off while others bloom. I kept the wilted one just in case. 

I got this plant for a friend that moved to Vegas, and in the course of caring for it these last few weeks I have fallen in love with it. But now I'm giving it away tomorrow, and would love to get seeds for my own if possible. Thanks for any help.
Nothing to add, just want to say fuck whoever keeps downvoting questions from people entering the hobby. Been seeing it a lot lately, everyone has to start somewhere.
Flowers must be pollinated to go to seed. Haworthiopsis flowers don‚Äôt open too wide; what you saw was probably it.
Now you got downvoted too lol. Yeah the downvoting kind of bugged me too. It seems like the right place to post, and I tried to be informative and polite. I was gonna rant in an edit about it because it's kind of bullshit, but I'm new here and didn't want my post to get too negative. Have an upvote from me friendo
So I figure that means it's a no go on the seeds then. 

Is it possible it was pollinated from being amongst other plants before I bought it? I dont think it had bloomed yet though. If I were to try, would I mess with the wilted flower I got, or the fuzzy bits it sheds? Or would it leave more distinctly seed looking things if it had seeded successfully?

Sorry if these are dumb questions, but like I said I dont know much about plants. Trying to learn though.
It's not as bad as some subs but I'm still not sure why it's happening. I guess some people don't want questions, they only want to see eye-popping photos constantly.

It's not like the internet points matter either,  it's just lame when new people seek the wisdom of those more experienced only to get a big fat 0 or -1.
From what I have seen, the flower closes, and makes a pretty significant seed pod at the base of the old flower."
"Review #89, Black Maple Hill 23yr Rye",,https://i.redd.it/7bdprq9i8e531.jpg,"Despite doing some research I can't find a lot on this. Black Maple Hill started off as a non-distilling brand that had a reputation for sourcing excellent Whiskey from Stitzel-Weller, Heaven Hill, and Bernheim. From what I've read this stuff may be Bernheim distilled, but I'm really not sure so maybe someone can clue me in. Sample courtesy of u/Marcovici, who I can't thank enough

*****

**Black Maple Hill 23 year Rye, cask 7, 47.5%**

**Color:** I usually don't mention color in a review, but holy shit this stuff is dark.

**Nose:** It smells as dark as it looks! Super rich rasberry and grape like a rich red wine, thick chocolate. Charred wood that is just dark, dark, dark. Those chocolate-orange candies. Burnt motor oil, but in a good way. Undercurrent of super clean herbal Rye spice, melds together with all the rich flavor.

**Taste:** Dark, musty, charred. Much dryer on the mouthfeel than the fruity and rich nose had me expecting. Some pleasant fruitiness that is darkly rich and tart, then huge toasted and tannic wood. A warm, slow simmering kind of menthol-pine Rye, it rides just below the oaky surface. Not spicy or in your face at all. There's a weird kind of plastic flavor that settles down with some time in the glass, almost like a cleaning product.

**Finish:** The weird bleachy plastic rides out here unfortunately, and settles down into a menthol Rye flavor. There's tannic wood and chocolate, rich dark cherry.

*****

This was a pretty fun and unique pour, that's for sure. It has some of the most darkly charred and tannic wood I've ever had the pleasure of knowing, and a nice darkly sweet and charred character overall. And while the wood certainly is the main attraction here it remains pleasant and doesn't overwhelm. The nose is probably my favorite part, to me the taste just can't match the complexity of notes found on the nose and the finish isn't as spectacular as I would have hoped. I usually wouldn't fault a Whiskey with a pleasant enough finish for ""not being spectacular enough,"" but considering the rarity, age, and price of this stuff it's hard not to take that into account. There was also the unpleasant plastic/cleaner kind of taste, not sure what to make of that. Luckily it did settle down with some air though.

A very enjoyable and interesting pour, with a remarkable character that I'm assuming comes from the age. It's a real treat to try something so old.

It seems pretty well settled from multiple blogs/posts by those who would know that KBD purchased a huge lot of aged Bernheim rye (maybe of different production years) that had been destined for the Cream of Ky label but never bottled. It came to Bardstown from Louisville in bulk and was re-barreled. Those were the single barrels that became the famous LaNell‚Äôs Red Hook, Doug‚Äôs Green Ink etc. The re-barrelling story make perfect sense due to the exceptionally high bottle counts from 20+ year old single barrels. That distillate was also bottled as the Vintage 21/23 house brand for KBD as well as supplied to Michter‚Äôs, BMH and Hirsch for their ryes. Guessing this BMH 23 is the same provenance as the Vintage 23 which generally is regarded as too tannic compared to the 21 yr versions of Vintage and BMH. The last of this was apparently bottled as the WFE 25/100 gift shop ryes. The best of these bottlings are some of the greatest American whiskey that I‚Äôve had the pleasure to taste.
If I recall correctly you‚Äôre typically a fan of deep charred oak notes. This sounds interesting to say the least and I have to point out that is a dark pour!
I've always wanted to try these. However, the 95 proof really bums me out compared to older WFE. If you can get your hands on them, the Rittenhouse 21/23/25 bottles are amazing.
This is probably in the top 10 for rare bourbon/rye notes in this subreddit this year. Jealous you got a sample bottle!
I got all my BMH bourbons at Lanells. I still have two unopened a 14 and a 23 yo. It might be 21 i cant remember they are stuff in the back if a walk in closet with some other goodies that are just waiting for the right moment to open.
So I'm new to this whole game, but many years ago I had the foresight to buy a bottle of BMH 18 year old rye - probably paid $65 for the bottle at the time since it was being cleared out due to the liquor store moving across the street.  I think regular retail was $85, and this was around 2005 if I had to guess.  To be honest I wasn't a huge fan, but this really could be due to my palate more than anything.  There is a part of me that wishes I'd never opened it, due to value, so I could trade it for something else that I really liked now, but the flip side of that is how would I have known I don't like it.  :-)

&#x200B;

The long and the short of it is I still have about 3/4 of it left.  I should see about doing some sample trades at some point.
Nice review of one that doesn't get opened often!  

The source is essentially KBD, which means essentially anyone.  Here is some light reading on the topic

https://www.straightbourbon.com/community/topic/15148-deconstructing-black-maple-hill/
Wow, thanks for all the info. A lot of really old ages and big names I haven't heard of in there, it reads like some mythical lost age of Bourbon.
Gotta be different batches. The barrels that went into the WFE epic ryes were 23/24 years old and the 24 I had was far far less oaky than the 25/100s (which I love, but are ""technically"" overoaked). I can't imagine this bottle came from the same lot.
Yes, you are correct there. So far ""too oaky"" hasn't really been in my vocabulary. I think this and a 20+ year orphan barrel have been the only uber-aged American whiskey I've had, and I've really enjoyed them both.
Those do sound good, but I'm not counting on ever trying them haha. I got lucky with this one, it was a secret Santa gift last Christmas along with a few other amazing samples. I just got paired up with a very generous person who has an amazing collection.
Yeah I tried to really appreciate what I was drinking, doing a little research I could tell it's quite a find. Thanks for reading!
Just to warn you, dont try to conduct any swapping on reddit, even via PM. Admins will ban you without a warning. We conduct all that stuff on a different site. 

Like you said you never would have known if you like it or not. You might have sold it and always wondered if you got rid of the best bottle you ever owned. But maybe all the money would have consoled you just fine haha. I think that's cool you got to have it though.
I'll read it later, thanks for the link. That's pretty much the impression I got, that no one really knows where it's from
Yep they clearly had lots from different distillation years as they were putting out various age statements around the same time. Not like the Ritt 21/23/25 that were the same lot released as it aged.
I think the ultimate test would be EC18, EC23 or PHC 24 yr. The problem is that yes, they‚Äôre oak bombs, but it‚Äôs the fact that they‚Äôre thin, pencil shaving flavored oak bombs.
Good to know.  I assume that this is due to some legality aspect?  I can get the not selling bottles/secondary market thing like the group on FB that just got shut down.  Surprised that the mods give a crap about swapping.  Eh, not really a big deal to me right now.  I appreciate the warning.
You mean the two I mentioned are thin pencil shaving whiskies, and you like those others more? Because yeah these ones were kind of thinnish. Still flavorful, but they're good in an easy drinking kind of way.
It's more about sending regulated items(alcohol) in the mail illegally, and using reddit as a platform to do it I think. There used to be sub for trading whiskey called r/scotchswap, it was an awesome community before reddit banned it."
"Review #98, Glenlivet Nadurra 16",,https://i.redd.it/as6tvi7b5e531.jpg,"This is the discontinued Nadurra that is aged for 16 years in first fill American Oak and then bottled at cask strength. They aren't single barrel, but would come out in batches. This is batch 0614C, meaning it was bottled in 06/2014.

*****

**Glenlivet Nadurra 16, batch 0614C, 55.2%**

**Nose:** Beautiful Bourbon barrel notes and rich malt, and that signature Glenlivet green apple maltiness but dialed up to 11. Rich toffee, chocolate, honey, toasted wood, green apple, thick bready malt, tart berries, vanilla

**Taste:** Bright caramel malt, sweet barley sugar, toffee and vanilla, green apple, light fruitiness, rich toasted wood, chocolate, buttery and bready. Some peppery spice that adds a light kick at full proof. Has an amazingly thick mouthfeel with lots of complex flavor. It's creamy and malty but has some nice heat and kick to it at the same time, and lots of rich barrel notes. Beautiful Bourbon barrel malt bomb.

**Finish:** Green apple in spades, barley sugar, sweet vanilla, bright maltiness. Rides out sweet and malty, with a nice cask strength kick.

*****

This stuff is beautiful. A malt bomb with huge flavor, well aged with lots of rich Bourbon barrel notes. It just seems to do everything right. It's Scotch with a capital ""S,"" a quintessential single malt in my book. It's too bad they discontinued it, but it seems like it was kind of inevitable considering the stats. I mean it was a 16 year Scotch from a major distillery that was barrel proof, NCF, and well under $100(I used to find it for around $60-$80). I'm a big Glenlivet fan so I might be biased but this stuff was such a treat. Luckily I stashed a few bottles away, but I still miss it being available.

Now that's a review! Don't you wish more distilleries put out a CS version in addition to their regular offerings on a more consistant basis? This was brilliant stuff. I know it' about meeting the demand and all but holy smit it would be fun.

Man I wish I could find one of these. A great dram no doubt
I love this Scotch, it will truly be missed.
Great poster by the way.
Love the stuff! Just wish all Glenlivet was as tasty as this...
My first real scotch after a bad breakup and a move to a new city back in early 2015. I loved this bottle a lot, pretty much opened up my scotch drinking habit ü•É
My buddy was just given a bottle of the 18 yr from his dad and we had some last night... Wow, smooth. Absolutely beautiful after taste as well. I'm a Bowmore fan, but this 18 yr most definitely made me consider my next bottle to be this.
> Don't you wish more distilleries put out a CS version in addition to their regular offerings on a more consistant basis?

More than almost anything lol. 

Like you said I know it's just how the market works right now, but it sucks they have to cut quality bottles like this to meet demand for mass-appeal standard and NAS bottles. They are denying the world an excellent Scotch that only showcases the quality of their own distillery
Yeah I've seen them around too. I have one more stashed, I might buy another. It's not just that I like it, but it's also just hard to see glenlivet ever releasing something like this again. And especially not at this price.
Agreed
Thanks! It's the only angle in my house that I'm real fond of, so I've just always gone with it for my reviews
Right? I've heard that the NAS Nadurras that replaced this are actually pretty good still, but I never tried any of them.
So true. Luckily we have IB‚Äôs.

"Review #97, Port Charlotte MRC:01 2010, 59.2%",,https://i.redd.it/bg5nqg6z7n431.jpg,"Summary of how this was made, it's interesting but I'll try to keep it short:

* Distilled in 2010 from 100% Scottish Barley from the Invernesshire region. 

* 50% aged in ""1st fill Bourbon casks,"" and 50% aged in ""2nd fill French wine casks""

* both were married together and aged in French Bordeaux casks from Chateau Mouton Rothschild. 

* It doesn't specify how long it spent in each respective cask type, but altogether it aged for about 8 years.

*****

**Port Charlotte MRC:01 2010, 59.2%**

**Nose:** Sweet red wine and dark fruit with tons of signature PC peat & vanilla. Briny peat and sweet vanilla, light chocolate, dark black cherry, tart fruits, fruity red wine, cake frosting, pastry

**Taste:** Bright fruity sweetness with strawberry and cherry zing, delicious vanilla custard and pastry, huge clean smoke, tons of vanilla, Islay brine, light chocolate and barrel char, darker tart fruit, red wine sulphur. This is much different from the dank and earthy sherry fruitiness I find in a lot of sherried malts. It's a fun fruitiness and it's super sweet, like candy but with a gritty red wine richness. Delicious with that signature clean, vanilla-heavy PC peat.

**Finish:** Sweet vanilla, charred peat, super sweet cherry candy fruitiness. So long and so sweet, it all melds together really beautiful on the finish like a summary of all the complex flavors.

*****

This is a winner. It's very fun and sweet on the palate, with both sweet wine fruitiness and sweet pastry/icing malt flavors. And it's all wrapped up in wonderful vanilla and peat with just the right amount of charred and chocolatey oak. Just so much fun to drink, I really like this stuff. This one cost a little over $100, which is a bit pricey at first glance. But I always feel like Bruichladdich is putting a lot of work into their releases and take pride in transparency and quality, so it's a distillery I don't mind paying a little extra for.

I was looking at the Bruichladdich site yesterday and saw this one. Might need to give this a try, thanks for the review!
Great review!  I have loved everything in the new Port Charlotte releases so far.  I hope they keep up the quality on these since they're fantastic.  The standard PC10 is my current favorite of the bunch right now.
Is this a distillery only release or travel retail? I haven't seen this one!
Nice review!  man, I've seen a lot of good reviews on this one.  I also picked it up and so far.....I'm not into it at all.  just funky to me in all the wrong ways and I get some really off-putting notes.  that's funky whisky though, some people are gonna like it and some aren't as much.  I've only had a couple drams though, so I'm hoping I get attuned to it and really enjoy it later.  Wouldn't be the first time.
I tried this at a tasting - flippin awesome. I was surprised by the amount of TCP on the nose for a Bruichladdich but it was a freshly opened bottle. I'm loving red wine maturation on my whisky too.
Agreed, this a great one!
I can recommend it if you like a pretty strong wine finish with your peat. Thanks for reading!
Thanks! I generally love everything this distillery does across all 3 of their brands, and I have no doubts about their continuing quality. 

I was really excited when they brought an age statement back to the standard Port Charlotte, but I actually still haven't tried it. Gonna have to get to it one of these days.
No, I bought it at a store in California. It is probably a pretty limited release though, and it did fly off the shelves. I didn't even know exactly what it was when I saw it, I was just excited for a barrel proof PC.
How weird, that's too bad. I haven't got much funk from it at all, if anything I could maybe see someone not liking it for being overly sweet. Hope the bottle improves for you
What is TCP? And yeah, a good wine maturation can really work well with peat, and Bruichladdich are masters at it imo.
I'll have to keep my eyes out for it then. Only one I've seen so far is the 10 of the new releases
Thanks!  I think it's the wine cask notes.  For whatever reason I can be very sensitive to wine cask influence and  get harsh/funky notes.  Seems akin to how some are sensitive to sulfur sherry notes, which I don't have any issues with.
Sorry, TCP is the brand name of a British antiseptic. It has that same medicinal, 'band aid' type smell that you get from some Islay peated malts - especially Laphroaig.
Gotcha, that makes more sense. I was thinking more of that standard Bruichladdich funk(which might still be a wine funk anyway)."

**Nose:** Chocolate, graham cracker, vanilla, huge smooth herbal Rye, light mint, big root beer char, orange citrus, musty wood funk. Delicious nose, smooth and chocolatey but still quite complex with plenty of Rye character.

**Taste:** Herbal Rye kick! tons of deliciously balanced toasted wood, rich caramel, low-key mint, warm orange, smooth milk chocolate and vanilla, nutty wood, vanilla

**Finish:** Light chocolate, sweet caramel, then the heat builds with cherry red hots and peppery Rye that burns nice and hot

*****

A lot of silky smooth chocolate/vanilla oak in this one, but it still can't deter the big herbal Rye. It just starts to get hot and spicy on the finish. Another delicious single barrel, but as usual with these it took a while of it being opened for the bottle to hit it's stride. I wish it had been as good from the first pour as it is now. I find that is a common issue with these though, I've just learned to not judge them on the first sip(and not to open a bottle at a party expecting greatness).

 Did you get any info from the liquor store indicating that it may be older than 10 years old? I know a lot of the store pics have been coming in 12 to 14-years old
Mgp or Alberta?
No extra info on this one, just what's on the label
If I had to guess its Alberta, but theres no telling. It's a few years old too, I'm not sure if they were doing MGP barrels at the time since it's only something I've heard about more recently."
"Review #87, Stagg Jr batch 5",,https://i.redd.it/rchmhm1kdg331.jpg,"EDIT: Well, I just realized that I already reviewed this bottle a year ago, so this is more of a re-review. Oops! It was freshly opened when I originally reviewed it for #32, so it's still interesting to compare it with the last pour seen here. Link to the original review: https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/7srwpv/reviews_31_32_stagg_jr/

*****

**Stagg Jr, batch #5 (Fall 2015), 129.7/64.85%**

**Nose:** Rich dark chocolate and deep charred wood, darkly sweet black cherry, tobacco, big Bourbon corn, intensely huge wood, tons of warm spice, sticky burnt toffee. This nose reminds me of a ridiculously evil villain in a western who wears all black, the kind that you love to hate.

**Taste:** Dark and sweet with black cherry cola and charred wood, then it quickly blasts off with a huge and hot mouthfeel of corn sweetness, spice, dark toasted wood. It's ""darkly bright"" if that makes any sense. Tons of rich toasted wood, tobacco, chocolate, thick cherry cough syrup, aggressive Bourbon spice. It's massive and delicious and oaky, it grabs your attention and doesn't let go.

**Finish:** Builds huge and spicy. Hot cherry, tons of spice, more of that rich chocolatey wood, the oaky sweetness lasts so long.

*****

This is like ECBP's evil twin. It is just massive in the same vein, you are not gonna pour a glass and then start to mindlessly sip on it and forget to taste it. It has a huge mouthfeel thanks to that ridiculous proof, but there's a lot more going on here than just burning and heat. It oozes character with villainous dark sweetness and tons of rich oaky notes, it tastes like it knows exactly what it wants to be and then accomplishes it really well. 

I could see some people not liking the high proof heat and intense flavor here, but I'm a total proof whore and I live for this kind of action-packed and spicy Bourbon. Batch #6, which came out right after this one, was actually the first barrel proof Bourbon I ever had and is what kicked this hobby up a notch for me. It was love at first sip. And after a few years now and many bottles, this stuff still is one of my favorites.

It's unneccesarily hot imho. While I love the full flavor profile a higher proof can bring, I dont believe that ethanol burn in and of itself is a great quality. Comparing this to some other outstanding high proof offerings like ECBP B517 or maybe batch 6 or 8, or almost any WLW or Daddy Stagg it falls short of these examples that show proof can provide more than burning. Again just my opinion, take it with a grain of salt.
It's interesting to me that the notes for different batches always seem about the same amongst all reviewers. Even for batch 9.  And it's generally well received. Wish it wasn't so marked up around here
Awesome review (and re-review.) I have not had this batch but agree with your assessment on Stagg Jr's early batches. They definitely can be intimidating -- but if you can get past the big personality up front I find them to be quite enjoyable. Thanks for the write-up!
I haven't had this batch, but I can confirm that different batches can be quite different in drinkability. I believe I have the winter 2018 -127.9 and a Spring 2017 - 129.5. The Winter 2018 is darker and much more creamy and nuanced. I had both batches side by side and the lack of burn and added creamyness and complexity of the Winter 2018 to the Spring 2017 is really noticeable. I also have GTS... haven't side by sided the Winter 2018 Stagg JR but I see why some have rated it higher than GTS when blind. The winter 2018 batch is really good and if they all tasted that way it'd be a must by for me every time I see one.
This can be a divisive Bourbon from what I've seen. Not to mention all the different batches there are, for all I know we've just had different batches and I've gotten lucky with the ones I've tried. I have heard that the earlier ones are pretty bad. I've never had any BTAC to compare this to either. 

I agree ECBP can be better, especially the older batches. But I have a C918 right now, and this Stagg jr blows it out of the water for my tastes.

All I know is the feeling when this stuff hits my tongue is always delight. Like I said in the review, I was already a fan of Bourbon but this was my first barrel proofer, and even back then it hit the spot and it was love at first sip.
Something else that came to mind is the fact that this is the last pour of the bottle. The time and air might have just been kind to this stuff. It did score higher this time compared to the first review that I linked
I'm guessing it's just not a nuanced kind of bourbon that different people will experience uniquely, it's this dakly sweet and oaky behemoth lol.
The first couple batches were very poorly received but it seems like they dialed in their batching/flavor profile on this label which is a good thing.  There's few things worse than an inconsistent batched product.
Thanks for reading!
I was able to compare GTS and Stagg Jr. both 2018. I like the GTS just mildly more than the winter 2018 Stagg Jr., but for the price, this Stagg Jr. at MSRP was insanely good. I am kind of sad I didn't pick up another bottle when I had the chance. I still haven't had batch 9 or tried it yet, but I really like the Winter 2018 and all the friends I've let tried it also agree, it's an incredible bourbon that is just so complex.
129.7 is batch 5. I've tried it. Batch 9 131.9 is much better imo, not nearly as hot, yet still very ethanol forward. I'm not knocking it as it is a serviceable, available, high proof offering, but again just for my palate imo its between a 6 and 7 on your scale. I'm not an allocated whore, and frankly I think some allocated stuff is far overrated (with stupid, unjustified secondary prices) but splurge if you can find a reasonable pour of WLW or GTS, or even an older ECBP and you will see what I mean.
Jury is still out on whether whiskey changes in the bottle even after opened. I saw an informal study done by a layman that sent whiskey to get gas chromatography and mass spectrometry results of whiskey at numerous time lengths after numerous pours. The changes were negligible.

I'd like to see some more stringent testing procedures because like you, I definitely have tasted changes, and could swear it's more than my palate changing, but perhaps not.
Glad to hear you could do the comparison and also a fan on the Winter 2018 Stagg Jr! My GTS is 2017 so I'm interested to do a comparison, may just do it tonight or tomorrow and add another comment. But I agree with you on the value of the Stagg Jr. A good friend of mine bought it for me when he saw it on the shelf and I was amazed by how good it was on the first pour. Especially comparing it to my Spring 2017 that's been open for 9 months.
3 batch 9s (on my last 1), going to be very sad when it's finally gone. It even beat out my GTS with 6 people in a blind, everyone placed it 1st over others as well (Blantons SFTB etc)
Whiskey absolutely changes in the bottle as you drink it down. I can't point you to any specific studies or anything, but things oxidize and alcohol evaporates, those are measurable things. And the more times you open a bottle and pour some out, the more you introduce new air and change the air/liquid ratio. And like you said, you dont need any science you just have to taste it. We've all had that last 1-2 ounces sit in a bottle too long and go stale or lose its flavor somewhat.
Oh man, I so wish I had a chance to get one of those >< Haha, super jealous dude!
That's just it...the ""measurables"" don't coincide with our palates, and unfortunately if you don't have science to back it up, the possibility that your palate has changed and not the whiskey is always a possibility.

Again, I'm not saying it is definitive, but arguable. 


https://tater-talk.com/2018/08/30/did-my-bourbon-change-in-the-bottle-1-year-test/

**Four Roses Private Selection OBSK, Ace Spirits, 9yr 3mo, 57.1%**

**Nose:** Delicious and complex rich wood notes that are perfectly balanced and toasted, with lots of warm Rye spice. Deep toasted oak, clean vanilla, graham crackers, musty wood, toffee, chocolate, warm and gentle minty spice. 

**Taste:** Big slightly tannic oak bites at you with lots of nice cherry fruitiness and spice. It's quite oaky with clean caramel and sweet cherry, black tea, char. Lots of exciting yet friendly spice and mintiness that just keeps building.

**Finish:** Very spicy finish with lots of mouth-tingling herbal spice, mint, cherry cough syrup, clean toasted oak.

*****

Good or bad, these are never boring. And with as many of these as I've tried now it still amazes me just how versatile and varying they can be(not to mention delicious). This one is very oaky with lots of big herbal Rye spice, a proper action-packed Four Roses. And it almost drinks like a Rye but has a nice spicy and sweet Bourbon backbone. Much more complex and interesting than most ""Bourbony Rye"" I've had.

Great review! We just picked up our first Four Roses Single Barrel Private Selection today. It is an OESV from Total Wine. This is legitimately one of the tastiest pours I‚Äôve ever had, right up there at the top with Thomas H. Handy Sazerac Rye in my book of personal favorites. Cheers!
I was just about to type ‚Äúman I‚Äôm having a pretty different result with this...‚Äù and then realized I was thinking about their OESV bottle I‚Äôve been sipping that‚Äôs a similar age. Ha! I‚Äôm a local and Ace picks are often tremendous. Were you able to try their 4R that was almost 13 years old? Never got that one...it sold out in mere hours. People said it was pretty epic.
Great review! I have a few KC picks that have come from Ace Spirits that are just stellar. I keep my eyes peeled for their bottles.
Thank you for the excellent review! I will look out for this one.
I found a total wine in Austin that had the little airplane bottles of single barrel.  It was amazing. I later bought a 750ml in Bastrop Texas and it was just good. The moving target is a bit frustrating.
These single barrel selects are some of my favorite Bourbon out there. Even the worst I've had are still pretty good, but usually they are just fantastic. Cheers, and I'm glad you love your bottle so much!
No, I'm not local to the area so I don't think I've had much from Ace honestly. I hear good things though. Their Scotch picks always look interesting too. 

Honestly I've had meh 10-12yr stuff and fantastic 8yr stuff from Four Roses, so I don't worry about age on these too much. That being said, I would definitely love to try a 13yr pick, sounds awesome.
How is the 2019 ace oesv? I'm looking at getting one for $100
I hear good stuff about them. I visited Minneapolis recently but they didn't have any Four Roses or WhistlePig picks at the time, so I never made it over there since those are mainly what I was looking for.
Ace picks are always exceptional. I buy nearly every bourbon pick they put out. Their recent Russel's Reserve pick is one of the best I've ever had.
I found it pretty great honestly.
A good Russel's Reserve SiB is a beautiful thing"

*****

**Wild Turkey 13 year Distiller's Reserve, 45.5%**

**Nose:** Woody, duh. Dark toasted oak, new wood, vanilla, caramel, tobacco, chocolate, warm and mellow spice

**Taste:** It's rich, warm, and soft. The ABV works very well to make this a smooth, oaky sipper. Caramel, big toasted oak, creamy chocolate, tannic wood, warm vanilla, some gentle spice. On the dry side. Very drinkable but with rich flavor and not thin tasting at all. 

**Finish:** Smooth caramel, lots of chocolatey wood, and mellow herbal spice. Not huge or mind blowingly long but it's tasty.

*****

This is lower proof Bourbon done right. There's tons of rich, toasty flavor and the low ABV makes it a pleasantly smooth sipper. As much as I love a barrel proof explosion of flavor, sometimes it's nice to just sip on something easy and smooth. And this performs beautifully in that regard, and without ever feeling too thin or watered down. The rich and oaky character is just delicicious. A very well done Bourbon.

Nice review, I totally agree with you, love this stuff
Im glad you enjoyed it. When are you gonna review the AH Hirsch 16y ?
Does it have a Thick slow baked texture like the old Austin Nicolas Rye and standard bottling?  Russel and WT 101 is over the top on Heat and Spicy Wood. But alot people like that. Some spirits with alot heat for my palate I think has a thinness. Probably cause my palate can't handle it.
nice review! I love the chocolate in this. quite a departure from more modern WT, and nice change of pace. I still prefer the big oak/leather WT profile from higher floors, but really enjoyed this.
I'll try to get to that next. I didn't realize until I looked it up, but this Wild Turkey sample was from our very first swap a few years ago(before r/Scotchswap was banned, don't worry admins).

So I'll try to the Hirsch a little quicker lol
Thanks dude. This stuff is really nice, and yeah that chocolate richness is so good. I wish I could go buy some, I can't think of anything readily available with a similar profile to this.
Good times ;-) I‚Äôve killed yours a long ago ;-) No problem, I‚Äôm just curious about your thoughts on this over hype stuff. Cheers!
I think some lower floor RR SiBs and WT Diamond are the closest in profile, if you can find them. cheers!
So I looked up that Hirsch 16 Whiskey, I don't think I realized what it was that you sent. Is it the one [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Bourbon-Youll-Never-Taste/dp/0975870319/) was written about? Released in 1991? Wow, what a sample. I think I saw the ""H"" name and ""16 year"" and thought it was Hochstadters 16 Rye, never looked at it closer. 

Do you have a bottle picture or backstory? Where did you get it?
I had the same thought about Russels Reserve, I've had some that get close. And even at 55% they still tend to have an easy drinking feel like this. 

How to you differentiate the lower floor barrels? Is 1 the bottom floor and you go up levels from there? I have a pick that says ""3 70 1"" how do I interpret that?
That‚Äôs the one indeed, also, the writing on the label of the sample is in French, it says ""Hirsch 1974 16 ans 45.8%. 
Back story : 
Last year I‚Äôve traded with a French guy who owned a bottle. But after our trade, I asked if he could either swap for more or sell some to me, I agreed , ‚Ç¨10 a cl, so ‚Ç¨30 an once. Bought 2oz, you have one and r/Ozbyoz did get the other once. 
Here‚Äôs the picture from my trade with him :
https://imgur.com/a/R3Wdf
the first number is the floor, so that would be floor 3. I've never seen floor 1 RRs, but have seen some from floor 2.

Diamond is also lower floors and is pretty similar to 13 DR in profile.
That's so generous of you, thanks! I will get try to get to it soon, thank you for reminding me. Like I said, I thought it was just a sample of Hochstadter's 16 Rye, this is even more amazing!
How many floors are there, or does that depend on the rickhouse? Would 3 still be considered low? Not familiar with the diamond, may have to check that out.
You‚Äôre welcome, hopefully you didn‚Äôt try thinking it was some H16 rye, and threw it away because it was way off profile ;-)
4 is considered the sweet spot by many. I've seen RR SiBs from 2-6, so I think 6 floors is the max in a rickhouse.

diamond was definitely similar from the sample I had, lower proof as well. it was a special release a few years ago, didn't sell very well and is still on some shelves.
I'm on review #88, so maybe I'll save that Hirsch for review #100
Good call ;-)"
"Review #84, ""WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel"" Bourbon Street barrel #1 (13 year MGP)",,https://i.redd.it/xvf0tsvptu231.jpg,"sample courtesy of u/hoffy8

*****

**WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel, Bourbon Street barrel #1 (13 year MGP) 114.9/57.45%**

**Nose:** The nose is hot and packed full of action. Caramel and smooth mint, tons of black liquorice. Rich chocolate, big toasted oak, burnt brown sugar. I can't overstate the black liquorice enough here, I could see it being enough to put some people off but I love sharp clean Rye that can shine through rich oak like this.

**Taste:** Rich chocolate and caramel, dark toasted oak, then thick and gritty ""fun"" Rye emerges. Exciting coppery and minty Rye, dark black cherry, liquorice, sweet vanilla, tons of burnt toffee, deep toasted wood. The thick minty Rye and rich wood work so well together, it's complex with huge flavor. 

**Finish:** Wow, this finish is incredible. Rich caramel toasted wood, mint, toasted marshmallow, and thick Rye spice just keep building to epic proportions.

*****

I've had quite a few 13yr MGP WhistlePig's lately (at least 3 others and I suspect a 4th), and this might be the best. It's definitely in the top 2. Like the others the age has only added complexity and depth to the flavors, it's not an overly oaked or boring Whiskey at all. Most importantly to me, the fun and bold Rye flavor shines through beautifully and is amazing with all the rich wood. God I love Rye!

https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/ac6iew/reviews_456466_russells_2002_and_10_other_turkeys/ed5jcqw/).

*****

**2004 Wild Turkey 101 (done blind)**

**Nose:** First impression is oaky and fruity. Deep toasted oak, warm cherry fruitiness, smooth wood, chocolate rasberry, hot mint

**Taste:** The nose had me ready for a KCSB heat assault, but it's much warmer and softer than expected. Black cherry, bitter caramel, soft chocolatey wood, tobacco, peppery heat. It's just kind of flat and soft, it has the nice oak and spice from the nose but it's missing the fun fruitiness.

**Finish:** Not much of a finish, spicy cherry with some tame oak and mild heat

* An interesting nose, but it doesn't do a whole lot for me after that. As I smelled it I was leaning towards tasty oak bombs, either a KCSB or ECBP. Then the taste just kind of landed with a thud instead of a bang. It has some nice rich oakiness but it's missing the Bourbon zing and brashness that I love in a Whiskey. It's basically still enjoyable to sip on though. Reminds me of some overly aged and boring stuff I've had, so maybe I'll guess a 12 year FRPS?

Score: **5**

*****

**Post reveal thoughts:** Looks like we basically agree on the nose being delicious, it was the strongest part to me. It wasn't bad after that, just kind of rich and a little boring. Definitely much different than modern 101. I think I prefer the modern stuff, has more action and spice which is what I look for in Bourbon. It jives with older wild Turkey I've had, seems like it used to be richer, smoother, and more oaky. From being older I guess? I had a 90's 12yr I felt similar about, it was really good but just a little too smooth and boring for my taste generally. Doesn't mean I wouldn't drink the shit out of it though.

2004...I can't keep bottles of WT101 around for more than 2 weeks
mid 2000s bottlings are hit or miss. I've not actually had the NAS from that era but I have had the 8 year old and its still hit or miss
Despite the scoring difference we seem pretty much on the same page. But I‚Äôm a sucker for fewer notes played a little slower and deeper. Great review.
Yeah it basically boils down to preference. I love Scotch which tends to have more of that experience you're describing, so I think when I reach for a Bourbon I'm looking more for that spicy kick and zing. That's probably also why I love spicy 100% Rye's so much. 

And this is all kind of a generalization anyway, a deep and rich Bourbon can definitely still have a place on my shelf. I just may not always rate it as high on a blind review."
"Review #96, Laphroaig Quarter Cask",,https://i.redd.it/5t6vhnvmrf231.jpg,"This stuff is aged in Bourbon barrels for an unspecified amount of time, and then transferred into a smaller barrel known as a ""quarter cask."" This smaller barrel increases the amount of contact area between the Whisky and oak by 30%, which imparts unique and (hopefully)wonderful flavors.

*****

**Laphroaig 10 ""Quarter Cask"" 48%**

**Nose:** It has all the hallmark Laphroaig notes, but it's very sweet and with a nice leathery richness. Huge smooth medicinal peat, ashy char, bandaids, musty wood, sharp toasted oak, leather, brine, sweet vanilla, caramel

**Taste:** Smooth and sweet Laphroaig peat. Big clean medicinal peat and smooth buttery caramel, sweet vanilla, deep toasted oak, that charred tar flavor you only seem to get with peat bombs. It's not a tannic or intrusive oakiness at all, but rather lots of sweet woody notes. It's light and easy drinking even at a respectable 48%

**Finish:** Long, charred, peaty and sweet. A proper charred and peaty Laphroaig finish, with lots of sweet vanilla. 

*****

I haven't had this stuff in quite a while, and it's not quite what I expected. Despite the emphasis on cask influence here if I had to pick one word to describe what sets this apart from other Laphroaig releases it wouldn't be ""oaky"" or ""tannic"" or ""woody,"" it would be ""sweet."" It has a very smooth and drinkable woody sweetness but still holds onto all its trademark Laphroaig flavor. I'm usually looking for something that's a little bigger and meaner, more of a ""peat assault"" if you will. But this is definitely some yummy and drinkable stuff.

It‚Äôs one of my favorites. Hell of a value.
It's my favourite reasonably-priced whisky.
My favourite ""everyday"" dram.
A great value malt, as you say - it makes for very easy drinking! Need to restock my recently emptied bottle of this the next time it is on sale... Thanks for sharing another fab review!
Quality dram it is. So, I can't tell how far down the bottle you are but has it all tasted that woody sweetness? Just wondering if it started out a little stronger and then mellowed out as it has been exposed to more air.
**In its price range**, I would place this well above average.  Surprising was the combination of sweetness that could stand up to the peat.  And Laphroaig is not my favorite style of peated whisky.  I try to get every scotch fan I know to taste it.

Nice review!  I was really hoping to get this exact profile when I picked up my bottle of Laphroaig QC a year ago, but it ended up being rather bitter and tannic to my taste.  I just chalked it up to batch variation, but either way it was a bit of disappointment.
Yeah, easy drinking is right with this one. Thanks for reading!
It's about halfway down. If anything, the richer flavors have come out more with time. When I first opened it, it was a little too light and sweet, but with this review I've noticed a lot more of the char and barrel notes.
Where I'm at it's not much more than the 10yr, and it would probably make for a better introduction to peated Scotch. Definitely a good value
Ok, thanks. Sounds really good. I had some when it first came out but don't remember much about it. It sounds like I need to pick up another bottle and sooner than later!
You may know the answer to this:  I've looked at the Laph website and read a number of reviews.  It is clear that bourbon barrels are used first, but I can't find info about what wood is used for the quarter-size cask.  Thinking of the options, it could be cut-down bourbon barrel wood, or house-made and charred oak (there are cooperworks in Scotland), French oak, or other.  Do you know what the quarter cask is?
I really don't know, my guess would be cut down bourbon barrels though."
"Review #95, Laphroaig 12, 2005 Alexander Murray 54%",,https://i.redd.it/0s76nprav1131.jpg,"This independent bottling of Laphroaig isn't from a single cask, but rather from a batch of 10 barrels distilled in 2005. It was bottled in 2018 just before it's 13th birthday, with no chill-filtration or coloring added 

*****

**Laphroaig 12yr 2005, Alexander Murray, 54%**

**Nose:** No surprises here, just a classic Laphroaig nose. Strong medicinal peat, ocean brine, boggy seaweed, vanilla, must, rich caramel, toasted wood, sweet honey

**Taste:** Sweet caramel and slightly bitter oak, a wave of huge Laphroaig medicinal peat, nice barrel char, vanilla, hint of fruitiness. Like the nose it's just your classic, delicious Laphroaig. It has a slightly soft character though(I was gonna say ""weak,"" but ""soft"" seems more fitting), and there's a little bit of a bitter tannic note in there. 

**Finish:** Warm smooth caramel, vanilla, medicinal peat, nice char at the end. Leaves the mouth smoky and numb for ages

*****

Classic Laphroaig at cask strength, no more and no less. As a big Laphroaig fanboy, I would normally consider that enough for a glowing endorsement. But at $100+, it might not be. Because honestly it doesn't do anything that the 10yr Cask Strength doesn't do, only better and cheaper. But at the end of the day this is still a delicious Cask Strength Laphroaig, and with the state of the Scotch market these days $100-$120 isn't unreasonable for a cask strength, age-stated Laphroaig. If you're like me, a peat-fiend and a big Laphroaig fanboy, it's a fun bottle and I don't think you'll regret buying it if you don't mind shelling out the Islay premium. If you're on the fence though, skip it or just get yourself a bottle of 10yr Cask Strength.

Great review, I love these IB‚Äôs. The way I see it is you can always pick up a OB 10, which I love but the IB‚Äôs are limited.
I was on the fence. Not any more now.
Alexander Murray gets a bad rap around here, but their cask-strength bottlings are really good.
This bottle is at my local Costco for $57. Skip at that price in favor of the laphroaig 10? Or give it a shot?
Is that really labeled NCA? It looks, dark.
Yeah exactly. It's a fun purchase if you're into Laphroaig and wann try something new and different, but it's not a ""must try"" bottle to get super excited about if you're not a big fanboy.
Glad I could help in some way. This stuff seems pretty widely available right now, so I just thought I should write something up to help inform people. I'm not really recommending buying it *or* avoiding it, just trying to give my thoughts on it. Thanks for reading! 

Also I can't tell from your comment if you decided to buy it or not to buy it
Are you sure that it's 54% Cask Strength like this one is? If so, absolutely pick it up. I paid double that for mine. But a lot of these AM bottlings are only 40%, so if that's the case I would skip it.
Same, brother. They had Glen Scotia 15 and this Laphroaig, both for under $60? Had to do it.
I think it's the lighting.  I passed by this exact same bottling at Total Wine and it's more light yellow in person.  However they had this interesting Exclusive Malts Dailuine for $64.99 that I was more curious to try.
Just a good dram. Gotta love that!
I have been eyeing it but not gonna get it for the time being.
Yes. Same bottle as you have pictured. 54% cask strength"
"Review #82, Four Roses Small Batch",,https://i.redd.it/6au78mmfwt031.jpg,"**Four Roses Small Batch, 45%**

**Nose:** First thing I notice is the delicious oak here. Beautiful toasted oak and a well balanced sweet richness. Cherry fruitiness, toasted oak, vanilla, burnt caramel, orange zest, menthol and light herbal spice

**Taste:** Against expectations this holds up well on the taste too. Nice oaky cherry flavor, smooth caramel, sweet vanilla, nice toasted wood, bright orange zest. It's definitely a little light but in my opinion it does pretty darn good at only 45%, it doesn't taste weak or watered down like many other things at this proof.

**Finish:** The nice oakiness settles down and it gets very sweet on the finish. Sweet cheery, vanilla, smooth wood.

*****

Even though the Four Roses Single Barrels and Private Selects are some of my favorite Bourbons out there, I had never given this Small Batch bottle a chance. It's just not one of the cheaper bottles I tried in my earlier days, and once I started getting into barrel proof and SiB stuff I never went back to try it. I am honestly surprised by how good this is. It's very balanced and full flavored for being only 90 proof, and that deeply charred toasted oak that I love in their higher end bottles is on point here. Actually a lot of the stuff I love about the Private Selects can be seen here but just toned down. Impressive for an entry level bottle.

I buy a bottle whenever it‚Äôs on sale.
Just killed my bottle of 4RSB on Thursday. Such a great pour for the price, I think it's on par with ECSB and Buffalo Trace.
It's a shelf staple at my house along with Elijah Craig Small Batch. They're both super consistent and approachable for people who enjoy bourbon regularly and for those who just want to try it occasionally. The price is set around $30 in Michigan, so it's right in my Goldilocks zone for cost. That said, if someone tries it and wants it with a mixer (Coke, ginger ale, etc) I am not put out (as it might make me hesitate if it were a $60 bottle, for instance).
What is a normal price for this one?
About $30 by me. Any more than that and you might as well jump straight to the single barrel."
"Review #81, Maker's Mark Private Select ""Old Town Liquors""",,https://i.redd.it/jhjy6qskps031.jpg,"This is the very first Barrel Select from Maker's Mark I've had, but back in my earlier Whiskey days I was a big fan of the 46 bottling. So I've been keen to try one for a while. These barrel selects use unique wood stave combinations to achieve different flavor profiles, and this particular barrel used 3 French Cuvee staves and 7 French Mocha staves. Sample courtesy of u/RudolphSchmidt

*****

**Makers Mark Private Select, Old Town Liquors, 55.6%**

**Nose:** Hot Bourbon. Cherry soda and vanilla, dark and tannic toasted oak, faint fruitiness, burnt caramel, harsh corn, light sweet creaminess, musty wood.

**Taste:** Brash corn sweetness, burnt caramel, cinnamon red-hots, lots of lively spice. It's reminiscent of more generic low/mid shelf Bourbons from my earlier days in Whiskey, although a little more balanced and well made. And there's some creamy sweetness and nice fruitiness but it's kind of drowned out by the heat and generic ""Bourbon"" flavor.

**Finish:** Hot hot hot. Cinnamon and cherry red-hot burn, some creamy fruits on the tail end

I enjoyed this well enough, but there's not much that grabs me and makes me want to pour another or buy a bottle. A lot of generic Jack Daniels or Makers Mark ""hot Bourbon"" type flavor, although fuller flavored and a little more enjoyable. It does have some nice vanilla creaminess and fruitiness to set it apart somewhat, but the flavor stops *just* short of being big and delicious. Water helped a little, it calmed it down and brought out some of the creamy sweetness but also started to water it down too much. Not bad but not much to get excited about.

*****

**Old Weller Antique 107 NCF, Binny's store pick ""small batch #4, 53.5%(done blind)**

**Nose:** Slightly astringent oak that mellows with some air, vanilla, light berry sweetness, nutty, tannic

**Taste:** Dry and woody at first, but some floral perfume and grape sweetness pops up to save the day. Sweet vanilla, cake icing, sweet grain, some gritty charred oak. It's starting to almost taste like a Scotch. Hard to guess ABV, it has too much flavor to be a standard 90 proof but there's almost no burn, gonna say mid 50's.

**Finish:** Dry floral sweetness, slightly bitter oak, spice and light menthol

*****

I didn't love this at first, it tasted like something overly oaked from Buffalo Trace but boy did it transform after sitting out a while. The oak is still prominent but it really mellowed and a lot of fruity and dessert sweetness has come out. If it wasn't for the Bourbony nose and finish it almost drinks like a Scotch. That's usually an indicator of a WHEATER for me, so I'll guess a Rebel Yell 10yr SiB.

Score: **6**

**Post-reveal thoughts:** So close! Once I settled on it being a WHEATER I almost went with an OWA store pick(it's definitely better than the standard 107), but decided it was a little too oaky so I went with something older. I'm a big fan of Wheated Bourbon and Weller Antique, and this was a delicious one for sure. I may have scored it a point higher but it was it was a little astringent and bitter on the oak. It's a minor complaint though, it's a delicious bottle that I would gladly buy. I also would have probably scored it a point higher if I had known it was an OWA store pick, since I'm a little biased towards WHEATERS haha. So it was a good one to drink as a mystery.

I paid $29.99 for this bottle. Glad I got one. Nice review bud.
You inspired me to pour a glass of this bottle.  Cheers!
Nice review! I wish stores here would do (or were able perhaps) picks of OWA. I've got a standard bottle that I've let sit for a while due to some really off putting experiences with in the past but I may revisit it again.
Binnys this year did an NCF small batch pick.  So not a single barrel.  This was batch #4.  Although this was the only batch I saw this year so batch #3 must have been last year and I missed the release.  Glad you liked it!
Yeah I do that as a callback to him on purpose haha. Some people around here thought of him as a troll, but he always cracked me up.

I love when that happens haha. Cheers!
Good info, glad I didn't put single barrel in the title. I wonder how that works, does Buffalo Trace concoct a few small batches and still let a store pick the one they like? Or do they just whip up a batch for them?

It was tasty, I love these bottles.
I clicked on his name and read through like a year of comments. He was hilarious!
I believe they let a store (typically a larger one) pick a couple of barrels and dictate the blending percentage of each one, presumably after the store has come up with a blend they like by tinkering around with samples. Pretty trusting to expect stores to be able to not just taste but blend as well. Thanks for the review, I was curious how these were.
No idea how it works.  Binnys did a small batch buffalo Trace this year as well.  These are the only 2 picks they do that are batched and not single barrels. That I‚Äôm aware of.
That's pretty interesting, never heard of anything like that. And thanks for reading!"
"Review #79, WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel ""K&L Swine Merchants"" #2449 (MGP)",,https://i.redd.it/dggxnrqh0l031.jpg,"K&L Wines recently released a whole slew of WhistlePig store select single barrel Ryes, 3 of which we are told on their website are MGP distilled. All 3 of these MGP barrels have the same distillation date of 3/21/2005 and were bottled winter of 2018, making them all well over 13 years old. Besides being a pretty decent age, I find it pretty interesting and fun to taste the differences between 3 Whiskies that all started out the same so many years ago. So I decided to just review all 3 of them together.

******

**WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel(MGP) ""K&L Swine Merchants,"" 2005 13yr, barrel #2449, 119.8 proof/59.9%**

**Nose:** A fierce Rye, just the way I like it. Big Rye spice, vanilla, smooth wood, sharp green apple, lots of dill, beautiful toasted oak notes, sweet fruitiness, cinnamon cherry,

**Taste:** Fierce and delicious Rye for sure. Green apple, fierce peppery Rye, clove, minty freshness, slight dill, sticky sweet caramel, awesome vanilla, toasted wood, rich cherry sweetness. Big fierce flavor but it has a very even tempo and huge mouthfeel, not overly hot. Not hugely oaky either which is surprising given the age.

**Finish:** Tons of clove and peppery Rye, charred wood, sweet vanilla, fruitiness. Leaves the mouth minty, peppery, and numb.

*****

Beautiful Rye, this is probably the most ""MGP"" of the 3 K&L releases to me. It has a lot of the familiar flavors I look for such as the fierce Rye spice, bright fruity sweetness, and of course that polarizing dill. It's done very well with the age too. It has really nice smooth and toasted wood notes but isn't overly oaked in the slightest and still maintains that ""fun"" Rye flavor I love. I really liked the Redemption 10yr Barrel Proof MGP, and that was much more chocolatey and oaky than any of these 3 K&L MGP's. Thick and rich but still feisty and fun, I like this stuff.

I couldn't really tell from your post. Would you say that this one is *fierce?*
Enjoyed the series. It will be a sad day when these are longer on the market. 

On the K&L tip, do they often have various picks in stock? I‚Äôm headed to San Fran in August.
I love all 3 of these and I love that we know that these are all MGP thanks to K&L's awareness of who their customers are.  I just wish Whistlepig wasn't such a shitty company.
So fierce
>do they often have various picks in stock?

They pretty much always have picks in stock, but how many just depends on your timing. Some are more sought after and sell out faster than others. By August they might not have much left of the picks that are in stock now, but more will probably come out between now and then.
Order from their site for pickup in the SF shop.  There have been several times when I can't find something from the site on the shelves. Also they will transfer stock from redwood city, main warehouse, or hollywood up there. (can take like a week, but it's been faster every time I've done it)
Their transparency is the only reason I purchased  WP to begin with.

"Review #78, WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel ""K&L Swine Merchants"" #2447 (MGP)",,https://i.redd.it/ogg5bcoc0l031.jpg,"K&L Wines recently released a whole slew of WhistlePig store select single barrel Ryes, 3 of which we are told on their website are MGP distilled. All 3 of these MGP barrels have the same distillation date of 3/21/2005 and were bottled winter of 2018, making them all well over 13 years old. Besides being a pretty decent age, I find it pretty interesting and fun to taste the differences between 3 Whiskies that all started out the same so many years ago. So I decided to just review all 3 of them together.

*****

**WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel(MGP) ""K&L Swine Merchants,"" 2005 13yr, barrel #2447, 117.3 proof/58.65%**

**Nose:** Super minty and smooth. Minty Rye spice, graham crackers, deeply toasted wood, orange zest, vanilla, chocolate, pepper, toasted wood. Smells fucking delicious, like I could eat it.

**Taste:** Very sharp and cutting minty Rye but with lots of smoothly rich barrel notes. Peppery spice, mint, deep charred wood, pepper, hot cherry, milk chocolate, vanilla

**Finish:** A long, spicy and minty Rye finish. Minty Rye, hot cherry, charred wood. Very peppery and mouth-numbingly minty

*****

This is a different beast from the other 2. Tons of minty Rye that is clean and sharp, but lots of very nice smooth barrel notes too. They compliment each other beautifully and add a nice complexity. But like the others, it's not overly oaked at all. There's no overwhelming wood or indication of this being a 13+ year Whiskey, it's just fantastic. And there's no doubt when you drink it that it's 100% Rye, which is exactly what I look for in one of these. When I first opened these, this one was my favorite. The 119 has edged it out I think, but just slightly. A delicious Rye.

**WhistlePig 10 Single Barrel(MGP) ""K&L Swine Merchants,"" 2005 13yr, barrel #2444, 114.5 proof/57.25%**

**Nose:** Rich toasted oak, chocolatey wood, vanilla, orange, smooth minty Rye. Overall quite mellow on the nose.

**Taste:** Chocolate toasted wood, quickly fires up into hot cinnamon burn, cherry syrup, minty rye, sweet caramel. This could almost pass for a hot and spicy FRPS except it's more minty and Rye forward.

**Finish:** Hot and fierce on the finish. Chocolate, pepper, hot sweet cherry, smooth minty Rye

*****

This is a hot one. Delicious minty Rye and mellow chocolatey wood, but with lots of hot and spicy cinnamon and cherry burn. It could probably benefit with some water added but I never felt brave enough to experiment with my 2oz sample. It's a little too hot and all over the place for me, I would prefer the Rye flavor to take center stage a little more. It's a great Rye but it's my least favorite of the 3 MGP barrels that K&L released. Take that with a grain of salt though because it was newly opened and from a 2oz sample, I had the luxury of taking my time with the other two bottles. I find WP often gets better and better as I go. So time might help mellow this out a bit.

"Review #76, Russell's Reserve Single Barrel K&L pick, barrel 246",,https://i.redd.it/51w3dlrhte031.jpg,"This bottling was released back in 2016

*****

**Russel's Reserve Single Barrel, K&L pick, barrel #246, 55%**

**Nose:** Very inviting and sweet with so much delicious musty wood, pretty sure I could peg this for a Wild Turkey from the nose alone. Sweet caramel and corn, big musty and chocolatey smooth wood, tons of vanilla, friendly toasted oak, mint and herbal spice.

**Taste:** Rich toasted wood and sweet caramel, vanilla, fruitiness and huge corn sweetness, nicely balanced Wild Turkey musty funk(in a good way). Friendly spice and mint that is just perfect. It's so smoothly wood-rich and Bourbon-y but without being aggressive or in your face about it. It just smoothly and confidently delivers lots delicious flavor.

**Finish:** Big spicy finish. Sweet corn, kicks up the herbal spice with lots of rich toasted wood and chocolate

*****

Somehow I never quite take these Russel Reserve picks into account when thinking of my favorite Bourbons. I think the fact that they are watered down and bottled at a consistent 55% instead of true barrel proof keeps them from attaining true ""rock and roll"" status for me like FRPS or WP single barrels do. But every time I sip on some I remember exactly why I keep buying them, it is some of the most delicious and expertly crafted Bourbon out there. And K&L seems to pick some very good ones.

**Taste:** Lots of smooth, friendly fruitiness. Not the assault I'm used to with these but it's very pleasant. Warm strawberry and orange, smooth caramel, a slight hot cherry burn, rounded malt grain, minty fresh, charred oak and light chocolate, metallic zing.

**Finish:** Continues with a long and super fruity finish, rich caramel, mellow spice, leaves with a very nice mintiness. 

*****

One of the more easy-drinking FRPS's I've had, it's smooth and fruity and fun but not boring or thin. Some of the big flavors I'm used to like cherry cough syrup and deeply toasted wood are there but toned down, and this isn't very spicy or action packed at all. Not the brash and fiery assault I usually look for in a FRPS, but this bottle is just so enjoyable that I don't care. It's a smooth change of pace for a Private Select, and another example of why I don't worry one bit about younger ages on these. 

Unfortuantely though Bevmo has recently jacked the prices way up on these. I got this one a few years ago for right around $70, but now these go for $120 at the stores I've been to. Bevmo always tended to be a little pricey on certain items, but that is just ridiculous.

Honestly I think Bevmo has a terrible pricing for pretty much everything they sell.
[deleted]
So 4r raised the price on wholesale side, about 15-20 bucks for those participating in their barrel pick program now. But $120 seems very high. I've seen them now like $75-85 vs $60-65 before.
It's weirdly random. I've seen other single barrel selects such as WP and RR at a reasonable price, and I even found a MWND at $80 MSRP. If you find a limited bottle they sell it at retail, but then mark random normal bottles way the fuck up. I only go there for beer these days, or sometimes a specific bottle if I have a coupon in my hand
If you price-compare and use the $10 off $50 coupons, they have some pretty good deals.
You used to be able to bring their prices down to something closer to retail using the coupons, but even that $10 or $15 off isn't enough anymore
Yeah I've noticed the price creeping on these over the last few years, and honestly I dont totally mind because it's still excellent bourbon and theres an upward trend across the board with all whiskey right now. But bevmos price is just ridiculous"
(Very) young peat and oldish sherry FTW,,https://i.redd.it/ytrbjtdby2031.jpg,">Think you're a master blender? Are you just intoxicated?

Yes and yes!

This mix is quite yummy, and better than the sum of it's parts. I was sipping on this 3 year old peated Bunnahabhain from K&L wine, and wasn't particularly enjoying it. I flashed on the idea of mixing it with something, and thinking something sherried would be good I thought I would try this 16 year sherry finished Balblair which I'm also not crazy about. Together they make a very drinkable Scotch. It's still quite peated, but the older and maltier Balblair along with the sweetness of the mild sherry has tempered the new-make harshness very nicely. I'm quite pleased with the results and will be trying this again. Cheers!
paging u/Hmm4 and u/I_SAID_NO_GOLDFISH

You both helped inspire me to experiment a little thanks to your mixing shenanigans, and also I'm drunk and enjoy the hell out of both yuse guys. Cheers!
Haha, cheers man. That Balblair looks great. I‚Äôve got some signatory heavily peated Bunnahabhain. I‚Äôll try some with a CS Clynelish this weekend. Will let you know. WCGW?
Enjoyment always goes both ways /u/buckydean!  

PS. Thanks for the shout, been a while since I looked around for recipes
And oh shit, happy cake day! Didn't even know I drunkenly paged you on such an auspicious day, this is awesome haha
Yeah I knew you could appreciate a good Balblair. This one isn't bad, but it's a little uneventful. Honestly I need to revisit it, it's been a while. But it sure mixes well. 

What are the specs on your Signatory Bunna? Mine really isn't bad for only 3 years old. I have a 4yr cask strength from battlehill that I haven't opened yet, and I remember that one being amazing. I tried it blind and guessed it was Lagavulin 12. Just trying to kill this 3yr before I open it though. Curious about yours. 

Sounds like a lot can go right with the Clynelish experiment!
I had kind of a bad day yesterday but ended up having a good ol' time drinking alone last night haha.
So you thought you'd take a trip down the blending road, Eh? It's a dangerous road for sure. For me it always ends up the same way,  my wheels come off and I go to bed! No complaints but a bit tipsy in the end. Fun at night but the next day can be a bit rough.

&#x200B;

I have that 99 Balblair - quite good!  I'll try your recipe and add some of my peated bunna in the Balblair. I'll even try some  in my 1990 so I get a peated bourbon cask Balblair and a sherried cask Balblair. I'll let you know how it ends up. I'll also try the Clynelish with some of the Bunna. I know how it will end up.

Nothing wrong with that. As they say "" a little whisky never hurt anyone, just the lack of it""
Dangerous road lol

>my wheels come off and I go to bed!

This is me too, I've never been one to blackout or do really stupid shit when I get too drunk. I just pass out and wanna go to bed. That bunna looks delicious
That Bunna is good. Binny‚Äôs has a huge selection of OB‚Äôs but a limited selection of IB‚Äôs. The IB‚Äôs they get are Signatory‚Äôs, Cadenheads and Gordon & Macphail‚Äôs.  Sounds like you have access to a pretty good variety as well. My resources are limited so I have to try to choose wisely. Nice to have options.
Little mix of Clynelish CS and peated Bunna  = meh it‚Äôs no Brora. Damn
Oh well, is the clynelish sherried? Although it sounds fun tempering peat with something malty
Not sherried, bourbon cask. All I could taste was the Bunna then the Clynelish.  Maybe I should have stirred the two a bit? I‚Äôll keep trying."

*****

**Glenmorangie Astar, 52.5%(?)**

**Nose:** Malty and rich Scotch. Honey, rich toffee, vanilla, floral notes, delicious toasted oak

**Taste:** Honey and rich malt, creamy and smooth. sweet pastry, vanilla, rich caramel malt, custard, lightly toasted wood, warm and lightly tart fruitiness. Excellent mouthfeel, it's very smooth and drinkable but still has lots of rich flavor. Tastes expertly crafted

**Finish:** Very nice finish, it's complex and pleasantly sweet. Builds to big chocolate and rich vanilla, fades out sweetly with light fruitiness, vanilla, cake frosting, and a little bit of barrel char.

*****

Classic sweet pastry and malt Scotch, with some creamy richness that keeps it from being too light or boring. The wood notes are a nice touch, not something I get from Scotch enough. It's not anything aggressive or prominent like you get with Bourbon, but just a friendly and lightly toasted oakiness. It all works very well together and makes for a very pleasant drinking experience, if a creamy and sweet malty Scotch is what you're looking for.

*****

**Glenlivet 2007 11yr, Signatory Whisky Barrel exclusive, 1st fill sherry hogshead #900134, 66.8%**

**Nose:** Lots of fruity orange and cherry hits and sets a fun tone. Gritty caramel, graham cracker, dark charred wood, clove, pepper, vanilla. Big and dramatic entrance yet warm and inviting

**Taste:** Huge syrupy-sweet cherry and bright fruit, rich caramel, clean toasted wood, thick graininess, bright peppery spice. It's about as sweet and fruity as Bourbon can get and still maintain it's dignity, because this is good.

**Finish:** Long sweet and fruity. Dark cherry cola, charred wood, beautifully sweet red-hot cinnamon burn. Just the right amount of heat to be interesting and lively.

* Cask strength for sure, and it tastes hot too like right around 60%. It has huge flavor and heat yet it's warm, fruity and inviting. Not a huge barrel presence here, just lots of heat and fun bright flavor. Reminds me of Four Roses with the in-your-face heat and action-packed flavor, but this is a step above any Private Select I've had. Last one I tried from Goldfish was a custom blend, so if that's the case my random & clueless guess would be Four Roses mixed with some kind of young bright Rye/crazy good Whiskey I would have never otherwise tried.

Score: **8/10**

*****

**Post reveal thoughts:** Goldfish said 

>Oh boy you are not going to like this. Glenlivet 11 year TWB orange label. I swore that this tasted closer to ECBP than scotch and sent it blind to a few in hopes of reeling in something like this. Truth be told, I know myself well enough that I would mistake this for /bourbon as well.

Man, at the very end of the glass I quickly flashed on the thought ""I forgot to look for Scotch notes, just to make sure it isn't Scotch."" But I quickly subdued the thought because it just didn't seem like a big concern. It did taste like an unusually fruity and sweet Bourbon, but a Bourbon nonetheless. Awesome haha. 

Even drinking a little more of it and knowing it's a Scotch it's not obvious to me. I do pick up some of that sherry sweetness now that I'm looking for it, but it's still just so different tasting. There's a lot of spice for a scotch I think, and it has that bold kind of cherry cough syrup flavor that you usually get from Bourbon. 

What's weird too is my different reaction to it as a scotch vs a bourbon. I think I might have liked it more when I thought it was a bourbon. It might just have to do with the different things I look for in the different kinds of spirits. As a bourbon it was exceptionally clear and bright and sweet, but as a scotch it is kind of brash and overly hot. I still like it, but I feel like if I had drank it knowing it's a scotch it may have only got a 7 but as a bourbon it was an easy 8. It's kind of throwing me through a loop lol.

It's also hard to tell from a single sample. It would be fun to take the journey with a whole bottle and see how my enjoyment and expectations play out.

great review! I have this exact bottle, but haven't gotten around to trying it yet. the bourbon notes make me eager to try it, as I love fruity bourbon, in particular ECBP,  as well as powerful character scotch.

I've had a few 10-12 year sherried Glenlivets that I've enjoyed, but they've all been very cask driven. overall I'd say it does well at young ages.
This one is a pretty unique Scotch, and hotter than heck at that ABV. Delicious and fun though."
"Review #92, Dailuaine 19 Cadenhead, 57.5%",,https://i.redd.it/tns0viwg49z21.jpg,"Dailuaine is a Speyside distillery that I believe has had only a few official bottlings, it's mainly used as a component in Johnnie Walker blends. I tried a Signatory Bourbon barrel from K&L (a 16yr I believe?) a while back that I loved, and I have been looking for another ever since. But for whatever reason most Dailuaine that I've seen is sherried, so I was very happy when I came across this Cadenhead 19yr.

*****

**Dailuaine 1996 19yr, Cadenhead, Bourbon Hogshead, 57.5%**

**Nose:** The kind of citrusy and malty Scotch nose I've enjoyed many times before. Quite typical in a good way. Lemon, hay and grassy malt, some richer caramel, smooth and rich vanilla, a dainty and clean floral quality. There's a slight funky twang to it that is kinda nice

**Taste:** Hot and pretty thick on the tongue, has a big presence. Some water evens it out nicely. Thick butterscotch maltiness, light caramel, slight lemon zest, vanilla frosting, a big even-keeled kind of fruitiness that goes very well with the thick malt. 

**Finish:** Thick malt and fruitiness, gritty caramel, finishes with lots of vanilla and an interesting kind of funky ""fruit twang."" This stuff really shines on the finish, it stays delicious and complex long after it has gone.

*****

A straight forward Scotch, it's exactly the kind of Bourbon barrel malt bomb I look for. I find these simple, malty Scotches have a harder time hiding imbalances and imperfections than something that is peated or wine finished, where unpleasant notes are more easily hiddden by big ""in your face"" flavors. Which is why I can really appreciate the *lack* of any tannic or musty wood, overwhelming perfumy floral notes, and brash ethanol/heat. To me these aren't the kind of Scotches that pop and come alive with a huge ""wow!"" factor, but the quality is still there. It's thick and rich yet very well balanced, an all-around pleasant malt bomb.

*Gritty caramel* ha, this sounds great! Really nice review. Great find.
great review! I agree with your point about getting a better understanding of the distillate when aged in ex-bourbon, particularly refill.

I have a 22 year Tobermory in ex-bourbon that is beautiful, thick and nuanced, but doesn't have the kind of power you often find in wine/sherry casks.

cheers!
It's like thick, earthy caramel you can chew on, ha. There's probably a more accurate flavor out there to reference, but nothing I could think of I guess.
Yeah it's almost kind of a thankless task making a quality Bourbon barrel Scotch. The flavor is so simple that everything is just laid bare, and when they are flawed it's very apparent. Yet when it's done very well, it doesn't have the big razzle-dazzle attention-grabbing flavor a peated or wine finished Scotch might have. I just fucking love a good malty Scotch though. 

There's a similar phenomenon in music this reminds me of. Country and blues are, structurally, much more stripped down and ""simple."" But that simplicity makes a musician's mistake much more glaring if they miss a chord or sing out of tune. Mistakes in a cacophonous, high energy rock and roll song are fleeting and easily missed by the audience. In a way it takes much more skill to play a simpler song sometimes.
Sounds good to me.
great analogy, also like autotune vs Acapella. ;-)

I wonder if that's why they chose sherry casks to begin with, and why bourbon was less common in the earlier days of scotch. if you're trying to push out young distillate or where there may be flaws in the process, aging it in a wet sticky barrel of Spanish sherry would make a lot of sense, as would proofing down."
"Review #91, Glen Scotia 12 G&M, 62.3% (Campbeltown series)",,https://i.redd.it/wjn302zn8gy21.jpg,"I have been exploring Campeltown Scotch lately, and I am really enjoying both the history of the region and the Scotch itself. I suddenly found that I had several different Campbeltown bottles and samples, so I decided to just review them all in one go.

Campbeltown is one of the 5 officially recognized Scotch regions, and it used to be a booming area for Scotch production. But over the years most of these distilleries closed until eventually only 2 remained, Springbank and Glen Scotia. As a result, in the 2000's the SWA was considering doing away with Campbeltown altogether as an official Scotch region and incorporating these last 2 distilleries into the nearby Highlands. So in 2004 the owners of Springbank renovated and re-opened Glengyle distillery, who now make Kilkerran Scotch. This gave Campbeltown a total of 3 distilleries, the same amount as the Lowland region, which secured their status as an official Whisky region.

*****

**Glen Scotia 1992 12yr, Gordon & MacPhail, refill sherry, 62.3%**

**Nose:** Tons of funk and brine, oh my yes. Salted caramel, boggy sea brine, lots of scrumptious pastry malt, lemon zest, rich fruitiness, vanilla, smooth chocolate, wet wood, briny and earthy smoke and funk.

**Taste:** Strong ocean brine and sharp Scotchy caramel hits hard, it's like standing in the ocean and drinking Scotch while a strong wave crashes into you. A lot of that is the high ABV I think, which delivers huge flavor and not just heat. Thick sticky caramel and malt, graham cracker, sweet vanilla, clean brine, gritty wood char, dry sweet fruitiness, light sherry, sharp peppery spice, chocolate, toasted wood

**Finish:** Huge fruity finish, GODS IT LASTS LONG. Peppery spice, rich fruitiness, brine, rich toasted caramel.

*****

After falling in love with Campbeltown Scotch in general and Glen Scotia 15 in particular, I was specifically looking for a cask strength IB from this distillery. I mean Springbank is prohibitively expensive these days and Kilkerran is too new, so Scotia was really my only option. I did well, because not only is this Scotch a home run but it has exactly the flavor profile I was looking for. It has all the rich malty flavor and brine of the 15yr but with an added bonus of a light and balanced sherry influence that doesn't overpower the malt. I'm not always a big fan of sherried Scotch and sherry bombs, so this is about perfect. I've had peat bombs, and sherry bombs, and malt bombs, but this might be my first ""brine bomb."" So pleased with this bottle I must say. Gonna score it pretty high not just for how delicious it is, but how unique and funky it is too. It's got entertainment value.

**P.S.** This is the last review in my little Campbeltown series, it's been fun. I have enjoyed every sip of every Scotch, it's a very impressive little region even if it is only 3 distilleries. They all have a richness and thickness to them, I haven't had any light and floral Whiskies from here. Heavy wood notes(for a Scotch), but expertly done, also seem pretty common among these malts. And lastly the funk. Whether it's an earthy funk, a nice peatiness, or lots of seaside brine, these all have a little something extra to them that is very well done and just so fun and interesting. Looking forward to trying plenty more Scotch from this tiny region!

Love your reviews. Hope to try out all the different types of Campbeltown juice out there. Springbanks are my favorite. The 10yr local barley in particular. But love the 12cs in general. Now looking forward to try this dram as well!
This looks very cool.  I would be all over this if I saw it too.  Glen Scotia can be a bit of a sleeper. Thanks for the review!
u/hmm4
Wow, this sounds downright delicious. Killer review.
Yeah that 10yr local barley from a few years ago was fantastic, I haven't tried the last few though since they've been sherried I believe. It's a pretty impressive region with a rich history. Glad you enjoyed my reviews and thanks for reading!
Yeah I'm super curious to try more glen scotia now, the richness and brine is just so unique and satisfying. I wanna see how much that carries over to other bottlings. Thanks for reading!
Damn, good review. IB‚Äôs can be amazing.
Yeah I've had some meh IB's lately, this one really restored my faith. And I feel like a badass because it wasn't just a lucky chance, I was specifically looking for a glen scotia so I done good
Ha! Ok, you done good. I‚Äôve found that Gordon & Macphail can be great or meh but it just might be me. Damn, this one sound amazing!"
"Review #90, Glen Scotia 15 (Campbeltown series)",,https://i.redd.it/sf1o8vki8gy21.jpg,"I have been exploring Campeltown Scotch lately, and I am really enjoying both the history of the region and the Scotch itself. I suddenly found that I had several different Campbeltown bottles and samples, so I decided to just review them all in one go.

Campbeltown is one of the 5 officially recognized Scotch regions, and it used to be a booming area for Scotch production. But over the years most of these distilleries closed until eventually only 2 remained, Springbank and Glen Scotia. As a result, in the 2000's the SWA was considering doing away with Campbeltown altogether as an official Scotch region and incorporating these last 2 distilleries into the nearby Highlands. So in 2004 the owners of Springbank renovated and re-opened Glengyle distillery, who now make Kilkerran Scotch. This gave Campbeltown a total of 3 distilleries, the same amount as the Lowland region, which secured their status as an official Whisky region.

*****

**Glen Scotia 15, 46%**

**Nose:** Darkly rich and gritty, smooth and toasted. Graham Cracker, chocolate, burnt toffee, toasted wood, vanilla, some subtle peat

**Taste:** Sweet vanilla, brine, delicious smooth chocolate, orange, pastry malt, pepper, rich toasted wood, more vanilla

**Finish:** Brightens up with sweet caramel and vanilla, some fruitiness, spicy toasted wood

*****

Dark and mysterious but in a pleasant way, it still has a very smooth and pleasant sweetness. Something I've been noticing in these Campbeltowns, especially this and Springbank, is a lot of dark, toasted and chocolatey notes that somehow never dominate. I don't know if it's the result of some skillful wood influence, or adding just the right amount of peat, or a combination of both. But it works with more sweet and malty notes well and just adds to the complexity without ever getting into tannic, charred, or peaty territory. Beautiful mouthfeel and it doesn't just taste like ""Scotch"" or ""sherried Scotch"" or ""peated Scotch."" Unique and delicous.

Really nice set of reviews. Have enjoyed them all,  *unique and delicious* well said - thanks for sharing.
Really been enjoying this series of reviews! Thanks for sharing another great one!
Also have this one in the cabinet. I wasn't thrilled at first, but once it aired out a bit I really enjoy it. Also, the price point is excellent.
Nice review, have been enjoying the whole series.

Agree about the balance you point out. This is a great bottle IMHO for getting some nice complexity at a good price but in a very easy drinking, approachable manner. A *put your feet up & relax, we're not being fancy* kind of scotch.
Yeah great price for a 15yr that's NCF ~~and NCA~~

EDIT:might not be NCA
Good way to put it haha, totally agree.
I'm not 100% certain this is NCA.  Nowhere on the box or the label is natural color stated, and on [Weinquelle](https://www.weinquelle.com/artikel/Glen_Scotia_15_Years_15216.html) they say it has artificial coloring added.  

This isn't total proof that it's *not* NCA, but until they come out and put it on the label, I'm not willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Good whisky, though.  And a nice set of reviews you've posted recently!
My gut tells me it has color added but that doesnt change my opinion at all.
All the other Campbeltown whiskeys I've had seem big on going natural, so I was just assuming this was too. Thanks for the correction. And thanks for the positive feedback"

**Taste:** Explosion of dark richness. Caramel, gritty wood char, then sweeter fruit and sherry that just pops. Rich chocolate, toasted wood, burnt toffee, wet wood. It has lots of delicious funk and earthiness. More delicious fruit emerges the longer it sits. Very nice.

**Finish:** Sweet maltiness, sharp bright fruit, smooth chocolate, toasted wood that descends into a beautiful dark char. Smooth and pleasant finish for a bruiser of a Scotch.

*****

This has everything I love about the 10yr, but dialed up to 11. It's thicker, richer, more chocolatey, the toasted wood is on point. There's some sweet sherry and fruit that is very nice, but it still doesn't change or overly sweeten what I see as a rich, chocolatey character. The longer it sits the more I get from it, especially with the tart fruit. Beautiful Scotch.

Thanks! Hope you enjoy it, I'm sure you will
I've never gone through a bottle myself, but that might have to change after this sample. Especially since Springbank only seems to be getting more expensive and hard to find(grumble grumble)."

**Finish:** Sweet pastry, vanilla, cake icing. It is super sweet and pleasant on the finish

*****

This is a sweet and very approachable springbank. It still has some of the darker toasted richness I associate with the distillery, but it has been smoothed out and sweetened up quite a bit. What I like is that it doesn't just default to a strong sherry influence which it seems like lots of 18 year Scotches do. It integrates a mellow and fun fruitiness with a delicious malty sweetness, makes for a very pleasant Whiskey where the malt is still the main attraction. The funky peat is stronger on the nose while playing a minimal role in the taste, but adds nicely to the complexity and overall flavor. It just tastes very expertly crafted in general.

I love Springbank, have had a bottle each of the 10, 12 CS, and 18 (12 and 18 still in my cabinet). I reach for them more than any other bottle because they are always pleasing.  With that being said I am going to commit a heinous act on r/scotch and say that my favorite of the three is the 18! Don't shoot!
Hey there's nothing heinous about liking what you like! It's an excellent scotch.
I don't think anybody is going to fight too hard over that.  I love the 18, the 15 is very very similar though so I've never bought a bottle. The 10, 12 CS, 15 are all great and I keep a bottle of all 3.  The 12 CS is usually the most liked for a combo of being CS and some unique flavors compared to the others."

**Nose:** Fudgy chocolate, rich toffee, medicinal peat, vanilla, thick malt, wet wood funk, lots of toasted char. It's thick and sludgy and rich, toasted and dark. Delicious and unique.

**Taste:** Rich, funky, and malty. Smooth caramel malt, milk chocolate, vanilla, toasted wood, earthy funk and light smoke. Some fun fruits briefly brighten it up. Not as peaty as the nose, it ends up being very well balanced and chocolatey smooth.

**Finish:** Chocolatey toasted wood and rich caramel malt. A smooth, rich finish. Not a jaw-dropping finish but it's nice.

*****

A stalwart and delicious Scotch. It's so unique too, not nearly as simple as ""take rich Scotch, add smoke."" My immediate impression the first time I tried this was *so much chocolate.* It has a dark, toasted and earthy character but still maintains a smooth maltiness, with just the right amount of interesting funk and peat. It seems like there's lots of delicious wood influence, more than usual for a Scotch, with tons of chocolate and a perfect toasted quality that stops just short of an ashy char. A great staple Scotch.

Nice review.  I believe the Glengyle distillery is also in Campbeltown.
Awesome review, just finished off my bottle of it - delicious stuff!
Yep, it sure is. What's interesting is that Glengyle was first opened in 1872 by the same family who owned Springbank, before it was eventually closed down in 1925. It was then re-opened 130 years after it's founding by the same family, who still owns Springbank to this day.

**Taste:** Huge and delicious with a thick, smooth mouthfeel. Pops with wonderful malty flavors of bright pastry and rich toffee, lemon, big vanilla, gritty coastal brine. There's plenty of clean medicinal peat but it's not big or overpowering at all, just adds to the tapestry and complexity of flavors here.

**Finish:** Sweet thick pastry malt, toffee, and leathery peat. It's clean and crisp and sweet with just the right amount of peat.

This is fucking fantastic. It has all the wonderful maltiness I loved in the 12 year and just builds on it. It is a beautifully balanced and rich Bourbon-barrel ""malt-bomb"" at it's core, but with lots of coastal brine and medicinal peat that somehow never dominates or becomes the main attraction. It is bright and sweet, rich and malty, dark and chocolatey, leathery, peaty, and briny all in one.

I've stopped and stared at this bottle on the shelf of my liquor store many times, never able to convince myself to pay $75ish for an 8 year old but I may need to reconsider. Nice review!
Great review, great photo and that‚Äôs a hefty pour. A malt bomb with coastal brine and just a touch of smoke - yum, and it‚Äôs reasonable and available. On the list. Have you had on of their WIP sherry cask?
Well that review made me want to run out the door and buy one!  I love everything I've had from J & A Mitchell & Co  - they are doing an outstanding job. I'll get to this one soon. Cheers
God this sounds good, thanks for sharing!
They've had several young releases, including these and the Work in Progress bottlings. And honestly everything I've had from this distillery has been great, dont let age deter you in this case.
I've only had the Bourbon barrel WIP, it was fantastic. I'm curious about some sherry influence on this now
Yea, me too. I‚Äôve seen the sherried WIP but passed. It has great reviews. I‚Äôll pick one up if I ever see one again."

Beautiful malt bomb with very rich Bourbon barrel notes. That would be delicious enough on it's own, but there's coastal brine and light smoke that makes it even more interesting and delicious.

Another great review.  They‚Äôre just killing it, great stuff and reasonable. Other than the higher abv can you pick up on any difference in taste from the extra 4 years?
I loved this one but no mention of lemons???  My bottle had lemons through and through. A fantastic bottle especially for the price.
Thanks for reading! The 12yr might have had a little more bourbon barrel influence, with the 8yr CS being a little brighter. Hard to say how much the age plays a different role. I reviewed these both a few weeks ago now, so I'm mostly going off my notes.
It looks like I got more lemon in the 8yr CS, it was a little brighter in general to me. I'd say it might just be an effect of comparatively drinking the 2 together, but I'm pretty sure I drank this one first.
I‚Äôve forgotten how good these were. I reviewed both a while ago..gave the 12 an 88 and the 8 an 87. They must use great casks. They are getting hard to find around here."
"Review #74, and a request for any info on: Michter's Pennsylvania ""Pot Still Whiskey"" decanter",,https://i.redd.it/m7iy1ip2l2x21.jpg,"My uncle(who is quite the character) is known to collect all kinds of cool stuff. He found this old looking decanter of Michter's Bourbon in an estate sale, and saved it to show me and my cousin's husband at a recent family get-together since he knows how much we love Bourbon. The tax stamp over the cork was broken, but the cork was in it and much to my surprise it sounded like there was still a fair amount of liquid in it. I immediately got excited and told him it was completely safe to drink, and that the only real problem is that it might not taste good if it went stale from a bad cork. Luckily I've learned enough here to know that even though there is a possibility of lead from the decanter, a small amount just this once wouldn't do any harm(gee I hope I got that right). So my uncle let us have our way with the liquid inside as long as he got to keep the ""cool jug."" The cork broke on us(unsurprisingly) but we extracted it successfully and managed to get 2 pours out of it, one of which is pictured here. We did some quick searches and determined that it might be from the 70's, but I really have no idea and any info someone might have would be appreciated. Here are some more images, and then a quick review I did at my Aunt and Uncle's house. https://imgur.com/gallery/sgAbBHX

*****

**Michter's ""Pot Still Whiskey"" 1/2 pint decantur, 43%**


**Nose:** smooth and darkly rich. Maple, rich toasted oak, vanilla, darkly sweet, very mild spice.

**Taste:** a little thin, but good. I think it's just the low abv and not necessarily stale or bad. Caramel and mild minty spice, thin chocolate, nice toasted wood, cherry coke. Rich in flavor but thin in mouthfeel.

**Finish:** chocolate, vanilla, toasted oak. Dark rich flavors but thin

*****

Despite being a bit thin, I was very pleased with how good this was. It helps that I had very low expectations due to the bottle condition, I thought it might end up being a total loss. It's hard to say if the overly light body is just it's character and low ABV, or if it maybe got too much air from either the cork being bad or sitting half empty for too long. I'm nitpicking a bit though, overall it was very fun and I enjoyed the Bourbon, and I'm glad I got to share the experience with my drinking buddy and loved ones.

Also, since I wasn't home I had to improvise with a glass from my Aunt's cabinet. I was actually very pleased with it, does anyone now what this kind of glass is called?
the mystery of the bourbon in the jug sounds like fun! my understanding is the same, that you can drink this stuff just in small amounts in case there is lead present.

thanks for the review!
Looks like a champagne flute to me
Well I'm no expert or anything, but I drank the stuff on Saturday night and I still feel fine. So I think I'm good! Thanks for reading
Ok thanks, that looks about right. I like using stemmed glasses sometimes, it just feels so fucking fancy. I have a couple already but I like this one a lot more, it's a little sleeker and nosed much better.
!RemindMeIfDead #48hours
If you want to feel fancy with stemmed for whisky, copita is great.  Like a mini champagne flute

Agreed on keeping the old corks! (Posted a comment but saw that you mentioned it too so I deleted it.)
I thought you would just suck it out, I heard you can suck a golf ball through a garden hose haha.

This stuff is delicious btw. I've been on a Campbeltown kick lately and was specifically looking for a cask strength Glen Scotia. So far it's exactly what I was hoping for. Refreshing after some meh IB's I've had lately.
I've only sipped on one glass so far, but it was real good. Tons of funk, brine, and rich malt. And the sherry is there but it's balanced and takes a bit of a back seat, which is exactly what I look for in refill sherry bottles since I'm not a big fan of sherry bombs. I've been loving the standard 15yr lately, and so far from my little taste this has everything I was looking for when I bought it.
Sometimes you just gotta I guess
I just reviewed it last night actually. I've got about 6 reviews I'm gonna post soon, all campbeltown scotches from the 3 distilleries there.
Yep, always a good idea. The only corks I don't keep at this point are Laphroaig, because they're all the same size and I have a million

"Review #73, Charbay Hop Flavored Whiskey release III",,https://i.redd.it/kv8z7lxxmbv21.jpg,"Even after some research I'm not 100% sure about the whole story behind this stuff. Maybe someone can correct me if I have any of this wrong. It's Whiskey that was distilled in 1999 from bottle-ready beer, a Pilsener from Bear Republic brewery in California I believe. It was then aged for 14 years, 6 in new charred oak and 8 in a stainless steel tank, and finally bottled at full proof with no filtration. I'm not sure where the hops come into it. What I do know for sure is that it fetches a hefty price and came highly recommended from a respected source. Sample courtesy of u/I_SAID_NO_GOLDFISH
*****

**Charbay Hop Flavored Whiskey Release III, 66.2%**

**Nose:** Rich and full. Maple and rich toasted oak, vanilla, thick caramel and cherry spice, creamy chocolate, some nice mintiness. Dark and toasted nose, but sweet and clean and not aggressive.

**Taste:** Flavor explosion, this is really something else! Now I see how Goldfish was able to pick this out so easily in a blind taste, this is pretty fucking unique. It starts out very clean with sweet dark cherry and dark toasted oak then it just explodes with gritty barrel char and caramel, exciting spice, bright cherry, black tea, clove. You are slowly and expertly hit by tons of skunky weed. The vague weed-like flavor that you get in some hoppy IPA's is amplified, and it tastes more like pine and good weed than it does beer hops.

**Finish:** The pine fresh skunkiness builds, it's beautiful and mouth-numbing. It's like I'm exhaling a hit of weed while chewing on winterfresh gum, but all the while there's a beautiful Whisky finish of burnt caramel, rye spice, barrel char, and super long lasting dark cherry.

*****

I was prepared for the unique skunky and hoppy character of this stuff due to it's reputation, but what actually surprised me is just how solid of a Whiskey this is. At it's core this is simply an excellent Whiskey, rich and full bodied with tons of flavor. It can be enjoyed first and foremost as an excellent Bourbon-like and darkly charred Whiskey, but with an added layer of delicious and unconventional hop flavor. It's not a bitter hoppiness, it's all the crisp pine and weed-like skunkiness you might get from an IPA. It's so well integrated and it all combines into a wonderful layered experience. It comes across as being not just delicious, but also very well crafted like some wine finished Scotches and Ryes I've had.

This shit is one of the few high dollar whiskeys I pay for. Silly good. Unique as they come. And super strong. My top 3 pours
I crushed half a bottle of this over a couple weeks. It‚Äôs a very different,  and very solid, whiskey. It also provides an acute and reliable hangover.
Nice review! Surprised you didn‚Äôt get the pot hop funk on the nose too. This is a ‚Äúyou have to try this bottle‚Äù for people who come over but at 133 proof it wrecks palates and takes names. I want to grab another bottle because it‚Äôs so unique and still so good but $350/$400 is sttteeeeeeppppp.
It is amazing to see this here.  My favorite whiskey from my home town- Ukiah, California.
yeah man, this stuff is wild. crazy thing is the bourbon crusaders version is even more insane.
Charbay III is a must try whisky.  Its unlike anything I've ever had and is definitely a top 5 pour for uniqueness, among other things.  It's not cheap, but $350 is not a bad price when compared to most pours in that price range on the secondary market.
nice review! I've been curious about this one for awhile, partly due to the reviews and partly because of the story behind it. my understanding was that they mixed hops into the wort prior to distillation for extra hoppiness.

i've seen this on a few shelves still for $350, but always pass. I don't know how I'd feel with drinking an entire bottle, seems more a novelty. what do you think?

I've had IPA whiskey from Charbay (R5), Chichibu, and Seven Stills, and while good, I found myself pouring them infrequently. maybe a good candidate for a bottle split one day.
The Master Distiller Marko Karakasevic  was on the [bourbon pursuit podcast](https://bourbonpursuit.com/2019/03/21/193-distilling-whiskey-with-hops-marko-karakasevic-of-charbay/) not too long ago if you're interested in learning more.
If I wasn't into scotch it might be fun to splurge on this since American Whiskey doesn't usually reach these prices. But I have an easy enough time spending large sums of money as it is.
It's funny you should mention a hangover. I have such a headache today, but this charbay and a beer is all I drank last night. I drank the full 2 ounces, but I'm no stranger to whiskey on a weeknight and I'm usually fine. Could just be a coincidence and unrelated, but your comment caught my attention this morning.
The nose was surprisingly normal, or normal for an excellent Bourbon anyway(even though I guess it would really be a malt). In a blind tasting I would probably peg it for a very charred, rich yet balanced Bourbon. Until I tasted it anway.

Yeah that price makes it difficult to justify for sure.
What's amazing is how good this stuff is. I knew vaguely this was from norcal, but usually that just means bay area and people forget that like half the state is still north of that haha. I passed through there once on my way to Humboldt, for weed related business coincidentally so it's appropriate that a weed flavored Whiskey would be from up there.
R5, Seven Stills, and others don‚Äôt compare.  They lack the complexity and depth that III, IV, and the Crusaders pick bring to the table.  I tried the less expensive stuff chasing a similar experience and none of them come close enough to the real thing.  It‚Äôs one of the few higher priced bottles I‚Äôve bought multiples of because it‚Äôs so unique and so damn good.  It never fails to wow when I drop it on the uninitiated.  I‚Äôve finished off a number of unicorn tasting nights with Charbay because it carries through the palate fatigue and always seems like the one fit to be the one fit the road so to speak.

Splitting is a good option.   There are folks who don‚Äôt like it.
> i've seen this on a few shelves still for $350

This is when I spit my bourbon all over my keyboard...you owe me a drink :)
I'd say it definitely has more going for it than just a novelty. I can't stress enough how delicious it is simply as a Whiskey on it's own merits, and the hop flavoring just adds a whole other level of enjoyment. It's like Octomore with it's high peat levels, that's part of it but doesn't tell the whole story. 

I still have trouble with that price though. I think if this were priced like an Octomore in the $150-$200 range it would still be a hard sell for me, but a little more tempting. A bottle split might be the way to go.
The stuff reliably gave me a hangover. Every time. That‚Äôs why the remaining half has been on the shelf for months.
definitely sounds like the kind of whiskey you have to try for yourself. thanks again for the review.
Yeah for sure, I recommend you try it if you get the chance though. Super unique and fun. Thanks for reading"
"Review #72, Knob Creek Cask Strength Rye 59.8% (done blind)",,https://i.redd.it/hlocln70oau21.jpg,"This was drank and reviewed blind as a mystery pour from u/Chardogg. I believe it's a special annual release from Knob Creek and this is the 2018 bottle, seen here: https://www.knobcreek.com/cask-strength-rye-whiskey

*****

**Knob Creek Cask Strength Rye, 59.8%**

**Nose:** Burnt caramel, darkly charred oak, tobacco, strong corn sweetness, musty wood

**Taste:** Burnt and charred at first but still very sweet. Smooth dark toasted wood, brightens up with big corn sweetness and caramel, mellow peppery spice, slight menthol. It's higher proof, lively and spicy on the tongue but not overly hot at all

**Finish:** Nice finish, corn sweetness with mild spice and smooth chocolatey wood notes

*****

Darkly smooth and sweet Bourbon goodness. The heavy char reminds me of a Knob Creek single barrel, but I don't think I've had one this smooth before. Really though as I write this, it has brightened up quite a bit with air, and lots of corn sweetness. Delicious stuff, it strikes a nice medium between friendly/drinkable and high proof/interesting.

Score: **7**

**Post reveal thoughts** Well of course it's a Rye after going on about Bourbon and corn sweetness haha. But this reveal brings up an issue that is near and dear to me. I am a huge Rye fan, and my favorite stuff is high-Rye mashbills such as WhistlePig(100%) and MGP (95%, close enough). I like the fierce Rye-ness they have, the spice, mint, dill, herbs, pine, etc. I've never cared for how Bourbony barely legal(51%) Rye tend to be, they just don't have that Rye kick I crave. I don't actually know Knob Creek's Rye mashbill, but this definitely came across as quite Bourbony. And reaching for it when I'm in a Rye mood might not do it for me. That's just my personal preference though and I'm not faulting it for that. It's a delicious Whiskey and I really loved this stuff.

I agree that this is very bourbony and must be barely legal.  I specifically chose that one for one of your mysteries as I knew it would be tough to pin down and I thought you may not have tried it before.  Glad you liked it!
I love Rye but this definitely wasn't over the top (Bulleit 95% rye) but still went down extremely smooth and a solid pour. Wish it had a little more spice to it but a great drink none the less.
Yeah it was a great mystery, and not just because it's so good. I didn't even know Knob Creek had a full barrel proof Rye. When I read the reveal I figured it was the Single Barrel Rye at first, but those are all 115. And this was way better than the couple of those I've tried. Thanks!
I believe 2018 was the first year that KC did a limited edition Cask Strength Rye.  I believe this was aged 9 years."
"Review #71, Mystery Sample",,https://i.redd.it/17gd114cj3t21.jpg,"This was drank as a mystery sample from u/I_SAID_NO_GOLDFISH , these notes were then forwarded to him for a reveal.

*****

**Nose:** Super dark toasted oak, thick maple, smooth herbal spice, butterscotch, dark cherry. Very dark and mysterious.

**Taste:** Deeply toasted oak that is incredibly dark and sweet. Maple syrup, brown sugar, lots of delicious peppery spice, hot sweet cherry, cinnamon, root beer. It has a clean, crisp quality despite being so dark and toasted.

**Finish:** Delicious finish that builds huge and rides out long. Dark toasted maple, huge cherry sweetness, mouth-numbing menthol and peppery spice.

*****

So very darkly sweet and toasted, but not in a thick or rich way, and definitely not overly tannic or oaky. It's dark, yet clean and sharp with this incredibly huge finish. The nose had me thinking Rye but it has a peppery and spicy kind of Bourbon kick to it so now I don't think so. I'm racking my brain for something similar but I don't even have a guess honestly, except I think it's old and 55%-60%

Score: **8**

* Reveal: >!Willett ""purple top"" 15 year single barrel Bourbon, #2371, 59.4%!<

* Really delicious. Definitely super toasted and aged. I got tons of maple from it, it just had this delicious sweetness despite how dark and toasted it is. I knew that it had to be pretty high proof, it was so hot but it drank so fucking beautifully on it's own. Great bottle. [Bonus pic](https://imgur.com/a/mcQv5M0)

Nailed it. Great job.

And very generous share.
Sounds amazing.  Nice review!
Great notes and guess!  Certainly a generous gift from the blind review master!
Goddamn that sounds delicious. I like to imagine an alternate reality where bourbons like this are semi-attainable for a semi-reasonable price. Great guess too.
Thanks for reading! It was a fun one fo sure. 

It's a 2oz sample. And I always like to pour the full thing for a review, really dive in. But you can see in the pic I saved a little sip this time, I wanted to save something for post-reveal.
Right? Even with just BTAC, I like to think that someday supply will catch up with demand and I can just buy it. Thanks for reading!"
"Review #84, Laphroaig Cairdeas 2018 ""Fino""",,https://i.redd.it/mt2mybcwa1s21.jpg,"Cairdeas is a limited annual release that offers a version of Laphroaig with some kind of unique treatment or cask finish. This is the 2018 release which was aged in 1st fill Bourbon casks and then finished in Fino Sherry casks, all for an unspecified amount of time. According to Wikipedia Fino is ""the driest and palest of the traditional varieties of Sherry.""

*****

**Laphroaig Cairdeas 2018, Fino Cask Finish, 51.8%**

**Nose:** Mean Laphroaig nose on this one. Creosote and tar, ashy char, burnt rubber, sharp medicinal peat, earthy wine and cherry sweetness, lots of toasted oak and wood char, chocolate, vanilla, menthol

**Taste:** Brine and dark toffee, creosote, big Laphroaig peat assault, root beer char. The sherry influence isn't huge here, but there are some pleasant notes of tart berries, sweet fruitiness and creamy butterscotch that does set it apart from your standard Bourbon barrel Laphroaig. Lots of delicious vanilla too which is kind of a Laphroaig signature to me.

**Finish:** Explosion of briny phenolic peat and huge vanilla, leaves wonderfully charred and minty and so peaty.

*****

It has the sweetness you would expect from a quality sherry finish and it has the Islay peat assault you would expect from a Laphroaig, and it's all very burnt and earthy. It feels kind of gritty and dirty(in a good way) like some kind of grindhouse film. The sherry influence isn't super strong which is fine by me, it adds a nice bit of earthy wine and fruity sweetness but at it's core it is a mean, peaty, charred, Bourbon barrel Laphroaig that can be sweetened up but not tamed. Makes for a delicious Scotch.

Much like the 2017 Cairdeas, my first impression on opening the bottle was that I wasn't all that impressed, and that maybe I should have tried it before buying it. But also like the 2017 I like it more with time, and once I actually set out to review it I find myself loving it. And I gotta say, I like this one even more than 2017. Here's *roughly* how I rank them from favorite to least favorite:

* 2015(200th)

* 2013(portwood)

* 2018(Fino)

* 2014(Amontillado)

* 2017(CS QC)

* 2016(Madeira)

Nice review. Interesting to see your rank of the annual releases.  

This bottling also has grown on me. I opened it with high expectations and was initially a bit disappointed. But, once I got past the neck I really started to enjoy it. 

If I had a criticism of the annual releases by Laphroaig (and Ardbeg) it is that I wish they spent longer in the finishing casks (and specified that time). I always want a bit more sherry, a bit more rum, a bit more ... influence on these strongly peated drams. I guess I am not particularly into subtle in my peated whiskey. It takes me a few drams I pull out influence of the finishing cask, which might be why I perceive them to be getting better with time.
Well done, nice review. Agreed, these releases can be a bit harsh when first opened but really come into their own once they can breathe a bit. Looks like you‚Äôve reviewed a handfu....hey wait a minute, you‚Äôve got the 2015 ranked higher than the 2013? Must have been a typo? Cheers ; )
Awesome review, as always! Love your detail + the rankings of the other years' ones! Cheers!
Great review! Really been enjoying this dram myself alot lately! It's actually got me thinking about doing some weird small cask finishing projects behind my bar
Nice review, I echo everything. This year's Cairdeas is going to be their triple cask at cask strength. 

BTW, from one of your comments, I have had a Springer burgundy that was full maturation as well as a couple BenRiach Peated port pipe releases that were full maturation.
Is this less peaty than the normal Laphroaig 10?
^ Seconded. Ardbeg Drum was okay, well more thank okay, but it could've been something truly incredible if it had spent 6-10 years in the rum casks post (or instead of) initial bourbon barrels
>I wish they spent longer in the finishing casks

I actually prefer a lighter influence with wine finishes, so it's all gonna be personal preference. That goes more for unpeated stuff though, it's probably harder to overpower peat obviously. I've had IB's with a full sherry maturation I think and they still don't seem as overpowering as an unpeated sherry bomb. 

Actually now that I think about it, I can't think of any peated Scotches with a full term (non-sherry)wine maturation. Maybe Kilchoman, but they were probably only aged for 3-5 years anyway.
Not a typo buddy haha. There's actually a few of us on ""team 2015"" around here, we tend to come out of the woodworks on posts like this to defend it's honor against all the portwood fanatics like you 

For me the port influence was just a bit much, it turns into a wall of rich chocolate and velvety noise. Which is still great in its own way of course. But the 2015 was like straight up Bourbon barrel perfection, and that's more my jam I guess. Cheers!
Thanks, and thanks for reading! It's a rough list because it's been a few years since I've had some of them. If I tried them all together I wonder if a few rankings might change, especially the 2018 and 2014. The only ones I'm absolutely sure about is the best one and the worst one.
Oh my, that Springbank sounds interesting. And I almost bought a peated port Benriach Single Cask recently, I forget the age. I wonder if that was similar. 

Yeah the TripleWood Cairdeas. I always say next year I'm gonna try it before buying, but then I always jump on the first bottle I see. I've just accepted and don't even seek out a taste first.
This is much peatier than the standard 10yr, but this is cask strength at 51.8% ABV so that's to be expected. The profile is more mean and charred in general too, along with the wine sweetness.

EDIT: As simple as your question was I still managed to misread it and give the wrong answer
I edited my response after initially reading your question wrong, not sure if you get a notification for that.
Yup, I like Drum and I am very glad I have a bottle of the CR, but it might have become sublime with a longer finish in the rum casks.
I agree for un- or lightly peated drams where a little wine finish can go a long way and too much can overwhelm the characteristic of the distillate. But with heavily peated drams I find it does take more finish to overcome the strong peat influence. I love the complexity both peat and an interesting finish can bring.
Bruichladdich seems to have some impressive ones from what I've seen online. Though I cant quite afford any yet
Ha, Ok, fine, that 2015 is pretty good! Really love  a good bourbon cask as well.
Same boat and 110% agreed!
Are you familiar with how the 2015 was made? They put a lot of work into it. It was made completely in house, small batch style. iirc it was their own floor maltings which were then hand fired, and distilled through their two smallest stills that are modelled after the originals from 1815. It was then all aged in their seaside warehouse. The idea, since it was their 200th anniversary, was to make laphroaig as it would have tasted back then. And it's not on the bottle, but the master distiller said that it is just shy of 12 years old.
I did not know that, thanks for the info. That's really cool.  I had a bottle and really liked it. Any word on the 2019 Cairdeas?
I have 2 more bottles of it bunkered, it's the only cairdeas I've ever bought backup bottles of. Can't wait to revisit it someday. 

2019 is gonna be a cask strength TripleWood. I love the standard TW, so it sounds good to me
Smart man! The only one I bought extras was the 2013 portwood. I bought 3 of them. I still have 1 left. Saving that one for a special occasion. Should have grabbed a few of the 2015's. So many choices!

I really like the standard TW as well so looking forward to the 2019."
"Review #70, 1984 Old Grand Dad 43%",,https://i.redd.it/ebx65w1pn2q21.jpg,"sample courtesy of u/mdonner1175

All I know is that it is from a 1.75L, and I believe this is a National Distillers bottling

*****

**1984 Old Granddad Bourbon, 43%**

**Nose:** Sweet and buttery smooth. Sweet maple and butterscotch, chocolate, cinnamon, smooth wood richness. Just delicious, sweet, and totally inviting on the nose.

**Taste:** Yum! Very sweet and smooth. And I mean smooth in a nice and flavorful way, if I meant thin or watered down I would say so. Butterscotch and cinnamon, light chocolate, brown sugar, some cherry candy fruitiness, thinnish wood. Not gonna sit here and say it drinks way above it's 43% weight class or anything, but it does do very well at the proof. Unfortunately, there's also some bitter notes that kind of intrude on the otherwise lovely flavor.

**Finish:** Just gets sweeter on the finish with butterscotch, honey, and sweet cherry. It also gets significantly more bitter and metallic, doesn't ruin it but I wish it wasn't there.

*****

Wonderful stuff. I use the word ""pleasant"" a lot with Whiskies like this to describe the whole experience, it's tasty in a nice and inviting way and, well, just plain pleasant. I'm not sure about the mashbill of this stuff but it reminds me of a WHEATER in that way, sweet and creamy and agreeable without much of the more ""challenging"" oak and spice you get in other Bourbons.

Unfortunately there's also a pretty prevalent bitter metallic flavor that pops up late on the palate and strongly into the finish, with a lingering metallic taste that lasts for a while after each sip. It feels intrusive and doesn't jive with all the pleasant flavor this otherwise offers, it makes me wonder if it's just how it tasted back then or if something happened to it over the years. It's not bad enough to ruin it luckily, but it's enough that I maybe should have dropped the score a point(I didn't).

I have a 1974 ND OGD 86 proof bottle. The flavor profile is fantastic and super butterscotchy in a way that I have only experienced with ND. The proof does make this a but thin and watery which holds it back quite a bit. The BIB is 100 proof which helps a lot but the secondary price for those bottles are nearly 2x of the 86 so not the best value. If you get a chance, the national distillers OGD 114 is absolutely sublime stuff. 
Is there some sort of club or something? I keep seeing samples like this. 
This one was super Butterscotchy too, but luckily it did pretty well at the proof imo and didn't taste too thin or watered down to me. I would love to try one of those other higher proof bottlings, I've heard great things.
There used to be a subreddit called r/scotchswap, it was a great community where we would swap these samples around. Reddit banned it about a year ago, and it's been sorely missed ever since. It's now forbidden to discuss such things, even in PM's, reddit will ban your account.

"Review #69, Colonel E.H. Taylor small batch BIB",,https://i.redd.it/q17z7mzaxjo21.jpg,"**Colonel E.H. Taylor small batch, bottled in bond, 50%**

**Nose:** Rich, smooth oak. Pipe tobacco, woodshop, vanilla, orange-y warmth, bitter caramel, peppery menthol. It's super oaky in a big, warm, and friendly way. It smells like it's going for a certain profile and is very sure of itself, it doesn't have a lot of spice or sweetness getting in the way

**Taste:** Big smooth oak, a little tannic even. Sweet and peppery enough to be interesting, but without that ""Bourbon punch"" to the face. Dark cherry, wood char, friendly peppery spice. There's sweetness but it's dark and charred, like brown sugar and burnt caramel. That big oaky embrace permeates it all though.

**Finish:** Peppery and oaky, with corn Whiskey sweetness. Rich wood lingers nicely

*****

This feels like a very complete package, like it knows exactly what it wants to accomplish and then does it well. It perfectly delivers a huge, rich, and smooth oakiness but without overwhelming everything. It's strong enough at 50% to grab your attention and deliver great mouthfeel and flavor, but stops short of that barrel proof punch because this tastes like it would be quite the bruiser at full proof. All that being said, it's a fine Whiskey but I find it a little boring for my personal taste. And not just because I'm kind of a proof whore(this is actually wonderful at 50%), but because I think I just like a little more spice and action in my Bourbon. Again that's just personal preference and not a complaint, because this is damn good stuff. In fact I think I'm gonna take this to a party this weekend, I feel like it will be a crowd pleaser.

Nice.
I'm going to have to follow along with your reviews because we are damn near identical in our profile. (Yes, I am basing it off this one review so far).
I‚Äôve been searching for this for a long time and finally found a bottle over the weekend in Charleston, SC.  Was dismayed when it was priced at $150.  Oh well off to search some more.

The guy also tried to sell me a half gallon of Weller SR for $200.  Major price gouging.
I was able to grab one up. I feel lucky because it was the last bottle after the guy had 5 for sale 8 hours earlier...I figured he‚Äôd be out.
Nice review. I haven't even seen this in Vegas anywhere. The one bottle of EHT SiB I found was like $100 and I can't justify that when there are equally as good bourbons for half. 
I finally found a bottle after years of searching. Need to Crack it open soon. 
I'm trying to sell 2 bottles right now because: 1) I got excited an overbought it at $40ea. a few weeks ago, and 2) I generally agree with your conclusion: it's a little boring. Solid dram overall, but just seems to be missing something in the excitement department. Last weekend I saw a bottle at a liquor store in N. Indiana for 80 bucks...way over the top IMO. Give me a bottle of WT Rare Breed and a bottle of OGD 114 for that kind of coin.
Great review and I think you nailed it. This bottle is side by side with 4R SiB for my favourite bourbon. I just keep going back and forth. Its got everything I want in a bottle.
This has become my new go to, neat, on the rocks, or in a Manhattan. Just enjoyed how smooth I‚Äôve found it, and it doesn‚Äôt leave a burning aftertaste. Liquor distributor recommended it to me, and the store had a bottle in the back, so at $40, I had to give it a shot. Really enjoying your reviews. Thanks!
Great review and fine whisky.  This made my evening. Thanks.
I'll take SmB over SiB any day, 5 bottles of SiB and only 1 good one. EHT SmB is way more consistent. Used to be 40 or slightly under, now it's 50+ here  and scarce, and don't buy it b/c at that point other bottles I'll buy instead that are way better. I liked it when it was at 40 and under. 
Nice.
Thanks for reading! I know, sometimes you read a review and you can totally relate, and other times it's like ""did we drink the same thing?""

But that's part of the fun in my experience, finding reviewers with similar tastes since we are all different. And it can really help too when you're trying to decide on a bottle.


I've seen it marked up to around $100 a few times, which is ridiculous enough. And I don't even like Weller SR enough to pay MSRP. Fuck that place lol.
Wow, SR isn't even worth msrp, not even worth 10 bucks. Fuck that place lmao
My cousin sent a picture from Charleston and I laughed. EHT small batch priced at $189! I saw EH Taylor yesterday for $36.99 and I'm currently having a drink. What a group of scoundrels in Charleston. Tell them to their face for me.
I just found a place with 16 bottles at $42.  So I ask if this is a new shipment.  I was informed that they‚Äôve been sitting their for over a year!!!!?  I bought one now, n plan on buying two more when I get paid
I don't know if it's true everywhere, but here in Southern California I have been seeing a lot more of it on shelves. I've been wondering if we are finally seeing the result of increased production at Buffalo Trace, since this is one of the younger and more sought after Bourbons.
Did you say you found this for 40 dollars?
I got this one for $40, sucks yours has gone up. Pry just because of the scarcity like you said, but it could be worse than $10. I would take this over other $50-$60 bourbons such as blantons or bookers though.
San Diego So Cal? I keep seeing it on the Reddit and I am curios.
Yes. $40 plus tax in the Denver area. https://i.imgur.com/ZQC0Zxo.jpg
Yeah at that price I'm buying 1920 and RR SiB, Pikesville etc, or Rare Breed which is only 40 but current batches run circles around damn near everything. Knob 120 has jacked up in price last year as well, used to also be just under or right at 40, then had fee price hikes to 50+ also now.

I'll never buy EHT SiB again though, 70+ bucks and only 1 good bottle out of 5. Two worthy of being drain poured. EHT SmB > SiB any day imo. SmB is consistent, SiB you don't know if you'll get a good, passable, or horse piss bottle lol

Edit - funny you mentioned Bookers. I saw Little Book Chapter 2 in store other day and passed, now it's up to 100 bucks. Nope 
Not quite that far south, more like L.A. area
You are a lucky man and I envy you, sir. 
This is $39.99 every time I've purchased and I've had 8 or 9 bottles over the years.
~$42 in VA and DC (DC can vary) 
Does it show up regularly in the ABC?  I've never seen it in Virginia.
No it does not. I've seen it twice in 2 years and I frequent the store pretty regularly on delivery day. My latest bottle is coming from DC which has it more often. 

Saw it in Charleston, SC for $110. "
I might be getting a little OCD about experimenting with different proofs,,https://i.redd.it/c1551mi6v6m21.jpg,"I'm using [this proof calculator](https://www.straightbourbon.com/calculator/) and some distilled water along with the measuring tools seen here.

Tonight it is a bit more enjoyable at 50%, although even then it is a little watery so I might try 55% next.

EDIT: Damn, 55% is pretty nice
Get an aws lb501, a box of 500 plastic pipettes from Amazon and mix by weight. .01g precision scale, and a drop from a pipette is about .002-.003g with the thinnest liquid I use. should run you about 30$ and it will bring an extreme new level of satisfaction if you're a hardcore precision junky.

I don't do this with whiskey, but I mix my own e-liquid using this setup and it is 100x easier and as extreme level of precision you can get without spending 500-1000$ on a lab-grade balance. e-liquid-recipes.com will also let you add your own ""flavor"" or in this case whiskey, and input your own volumetric-to-mass conversion numbers, also it has alcohol-base as a generic option I believe. 

Have a slow-pour  flow on your bottle, pour-measure to within 1/2 - 2g's of your desired quantity, then use pipettes to bring it to within 2mg or so. Plus, you can measure directly into your glass and avoid loss from legs. Say you're aiming at mixing 50ml, I'd say you're probably get somewhere between 5-15ml better precision given over all loss/overfill mixing combined, maybe better.

And this definitely isn't trying to gatekeep, I just also have ocd symptoms and I definitely wish I had started mixing by weight sooner because of the personal increased level of satisfaction with precision. Just trynna help out.
I‚Äôd say you‚Äôve graduated. 
Oh also, I highly recommend mixing scotches and rye/bourbon. Just a minibottle's worth of Glenfiddich in a fifth volume infinity bottle with ogd bib, Rittenhouse, Evan bib, and a few others added an awesome honey profile to the spice and oak.
That sounds fun. Did you check ABV of any bottle that was open for long time?
You‚Äôre a nerd!



And I love it! 
If you‚Äôre going to experiment, it‚Äôs worth doing right. 
To me this was way too alcohol forward. Adding water definitely improves it, nice seeing your experiment!
Thanks for the advice dude, but I think the setup I have is about as anal as I want to get. I'm a lazy man by nature. Who knows who might read this post and want to take it farther though, so it's still some great recommendations.

Yeah mixing is something else I've been very curious about. I've dabbled a little by just pouring a few random things together but it would be fun to do it in a more controlled way.
All I'm doing is adding precise amounts of water to reach a specific proof(although not as precise as some other methods out there as someone else commented). I use the calculator that I linked to determine how much water I need to add to a certain amount of whiskey. I don't have anything that measures ABV.
Yeah a little bit, thanks haha
Haha no problem, it really is taking it to the extreme with something like this. E liquid flavors are crazy concentrated sometimes and .002g can make a real difference in a small bottle, so it is the most practical for that.

Keep doin your thing my dude, I really just poured the bottoms of some mid-shelf American whiskey's into a 750ml bottle over a few weeks with the addition of an ounce or two of sherried scotch. 

I tried a bit of angel's envy sherry-finished rye a couple months ago and the bottle I mixed ended up having a really similar profile, which was awesome because angel's envy is non-existent where I live, and also really expensive compared to the bottoms of a few 30$ bottles mixed together. Now I don't have an elite palate or anything, but for me it was an awesome experience just because I really wasn't expecting anything special.
Goddammit I do love whiskey.
Yeah a lot of my blending has been a practicality thing too. Me and my girlfriend went to see Gone With the Wind for the 80th anniversary re-release last week, and I brought a flask for us to sip on(its 4 hours long). I emptied the last of my OGD 114 into it and still had room, so after experimenting in a glass I topped it off with makers mark cask strength. It was pretty darn good.
I'll drink to that! "
"Review #68, Mystery Sample",,https://i.redd.it/n9099vh58sk21.jpg,"Mystery sample is from u/I_SAID_NO_GOLDFISH, these are the notes that I sent along for a reveal

*****

**Nose:** This smells like a rich, oaky Rye. Big smooth chocolate and deliciously perfect toasted wood, mellow yet pervasive cool minty Rye, vanilla, toasted marshmallow, pepper, some sharper fruity sweetness that melds nicely into the richly dark notes

**Taste:** Rye for sure, with plenty of rich smooth barrel flavor. Dark and spice-y Rye, cool smooth mint, rich wood char, tons of peppery action, rich sweet caramel, pleasant vanilla

**Finish:**Loooong finish of burnt wood and bright peppery Rye, mellows into warm rich vanilla and mint. So toasted and rich and minty, delicious finish.

*****

This is oaky Rye done right. It's dark and rich and toasted, it hits all the right 'rich barrel' notes without anything unpleasant, tannic, or overly oaked. And yet the wood doesn't hog all the attention at all. Delicious minty Rye goodness still shines through beautifully, and there's caramel and vanilla that come through pleasantly clean and sweet. Normally I prefer Rye that is brash and spicy, almost challenging. This is on the other end of the spectrum, but I still find it so good that it doesn't even feel fair to other Ryes out there.

I've gone on and on about Rye so much in this review, and I'm just now remembering this is a mystery sample so I really hope that it's actually a Rye. I think it has some age on it and is a proper Rye, I'm gonna guess a Smooth Ambler Old Scout Single Barrel Rye at about 55%.

**Reveal:** >!Goldfish's special blend, in his own words: ""Willett 4 Year wax top with GTS/WhistlePig(13yMGP)/Charbay III to taste""!<

* Obviously a very fun sample. I was sure that this was a Rye, and furthermore I felt good that it was MGP due to the fierce ""Rye-ness"" of it. And I don't normally commit this strongly to something in a mystery sample, so I'm glad I wasn't totally wrong. It tasted very rich and dark for a rye though, which I took for being older Rye with strong barrel influence. Nice work blending this, the flavors all work very well together and it comes across as totally cohesive.

*****

**Springbank 14 Bourbon Wood, 55.8%**

**Nose:** So Springbanky, extra peaty though. Earthy peat, menthol, big toasted wood, tons and tons of chocolate, thick toffee and funk, nice sharp brine.

**Taste:** Super thick and rich, not as peaty as the nose. Bright toffee and brine, sweet vanilla, light funky peat, so much rich beautiful toasted wood, thick fudgey chocolate. It's earthy, funky, rich, toasted, briny, Scotchy, bright, dark, and sweet all together. Complex but so deliciously direct. It's fiercely Springbank all the way. 

**Finish:** Long finish of charred oak, thick scotchy caramel funk, brine. Rides out long, rich, and thick.

*****

Fucking delicious, Springbank can really deliver and hit the spot oh my god. The nose could almost pass for a heavily peated Islay, but the taste has so much more going on than that. It has a rich and sweet 'quintessential Scotch' quality to it, but at the same time there's tons of dark, charred wood chocolatey goodness with delicious funky peat and brine too. And it has this all-around huge presence and thick mouthfeel that is unreal. Springbank ftw.

I've seen mixed reviews on this one, but I got the bottle and I'm in your camp.  This shit be very nice!  You get the rich sweetness of the typical first/second fill ex-bourbon vatting, but that Springbank earthiness and funk is certainly prominent.  This is how it's properly done, as opposed to say something like Bowmore's Dorus Mor which is all ex-bourbon cask with no smoke or other character at all.
Love your review notes on this one! Have been holding onto an unopened bottle of this for a while, and I‚Äôm even more excited to crack it open after reading what‚Äôs in store.
I'm glad you enjoyed it. To me, it really showcases their distillate and was quite enjoyable. Though, it was one of the more polarizing releases. 
So, it sounds like you liked this one, eh? Good to hear, I respect your opinion. I just happen to have a bottle of this one that will have to be opened up, soon. Love the sweet caramel and vanilla notes and of course the Springbank funk so it should be fun.  Great review by the way. 
Hey, u/audioguy1988 , be sure to check this write-up out if you haven‚Äôt already.
I'm glad to hear you say that about Dorus Mor. I had a bottle pass through my hands recently, and I almost wanted to get one for myself because it looked so good. But I passed, I've just been disappointed by Bownore too many times(including cask strength IB's). Glad I didn't miss out on anything good. 
Thanks friend! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did
How could this be polarizing? Only way I could see someone not liking this is if they don't like peat or they don't like springbank.
Thanks friendo! Yeah it's pretty impressive, if I found a bottle for a reasonable price I would buy one. I think you will enjoy it. 
Well that sounds fantastic 
I like bowmore and had high hopes, but I sampled it yesterday and it wasn‚Äôt what I wanted at all.  The bourbon cask was nice but all of the distillery character was gone and the smoke was super light, almost not even there.  Disappointing.
I think people thought it was an off profile dram. They wanted the bigger in your face Springer. I liked it. 
I'm really looking forward to it. A bit of a cold right now but that's nothing a little whisky can't cure! 
> smoke was super light, almost not even there. 

I've tried about 5 Bowmores now, including a couple cask strength IB's, and they have all been very light smoke and just kind of boring in general. I don't know if I'm just not a fan of their style, or have gotten unlucky, but at this point it would take a sampling or a very good recommendation for me to buy another one.
I'll drink to that!
It was a decent enough whisky and very sweet and palatable at 55% abv, but yeah, no smoke or anything else suggesting Islay.  If you enjoy your Islay peat then this is a hard pass.  I like their 12 yo just fine, but their other OB lineup is a huge disappointment and the 12 is really for beginners only.  They need a revamp."
"Review #82, ""Ledaig 13"" G&M Binny's pick, 56.9%",,https://i.redd.it/krb3uiiatej21.jpg,"Courtesy of u/Nats_Fan

*****

**Ledaig 13, Gordon and Macphail Binny's pick, 2000-2014, refill sherry hogshead, 56.9%**

**Nose:** Delicious peat monster for sure. Charred medicinal peat, lots of clean brine, caramel, milk chocolate, vanilla, tar. There might be a kind of smooth and dark undercurrent of fruity sherry funk, but if I wasn't looking for it I don't think I would find it.

**Taste:** Still a peat monster, but it's sweet and surprisingly light within that context. Sweet caramel and vanilla icing, charred peat, ashy and burnt wood, delicate chocolate, warm dark fruitiness. Again if there is any sherry influence here it doesn't jump out, but maybe helps to create a dark and fruity mouthfeel along with the fierce charred peat.

**Finish:** Warm and fruity caramel, menthol, intense peat and lots of brine. Clean, sweet peat lingers.

*****

This manages to keep a sweet and light character despite plenty of aggressive peat, char, and dark fruity chocolate. An interesting peated dram. I've had this experience with Ledaig before, where it has all of the delicious flavors of an Islay but stays kind of reserved and doesn't smack you in the face with them. I can't speak to much of a sherry influence here, but if it melded in there and helped with all the stronger flavors I'm all for it.

>I've had this experience with Ledaig before, where it has all of the delicious flavors of an Islay but stays kind of reserved and doesn't smack you in the face with them

This is different from something like Ardmore or Talisker for example, which have unique non-islay peat profiles to me. Ledaig is like a delicious Islay mini-me(friendlier though)."
"Review #67, High West ""Double Rye!"" Rum cask single barrel, Hi-Time Wine",,https://i.redd.it/trkmasbdm0j21.jpg,"I really like double rye. 
**High West ""Double Rye!"" single barrel #9121, rum barrel aged for 1yr 1mo, Hi-Time Wine pick, 51.2%**

**Nose:** It's rich and elegant, doesn't jump out at you and attack the senses. Toffee, creamy pastry, tart berry, metallic twang, banana, clove spice and lots of dill, light chocolate, vanilla

**Taste:** It's sweet and rich, but also brighter and more ""fun"" than the nose. Brash Rye spice and clean crisp clove, settles down into yummy banana, sweet and creamy cereal malt/pastry, dill, orange, toffee, vanilla, caramelized barrel char.

**Finish:** Light and sweet finish. Sweet sugar pastry, light caramel, easygoing but lingering Rye spice

*****

I did not care for this bottle when I first opened it, and even at the reasonable price of $45 I regretted buying it. It was closed and monotone, uneventful. I am happy to report that after being open for about 5 months it has really improved, becoming much more lively and complex with time. I have some experience with Rum-finished Scotch, and I find it can be hard to clearly define what a rum finish adds to a Whisky other than a general ""richness"" which this stuff certainly has. It is definitely a sweet Rye, but not in a sugary overload ""flavor added"" kind of way. It's like a smooth and rich sweetness, it stays very well balanced and is fun to drink. There's also lots of this yummy banana kind of funk, not sure if it has anything to do with the rum finish but I find it unique and delicious. And luckily it also delivers plenty of yummy Rye spice and dill, which is very important to me because I like my Rye to taste like a friggin' Rye. The more I drink this the more I like it.

I remember getting a lot of spearmint out of the bottle I had. Loved the review! 
I've seen lots of Prairie Bourbon store picks, but not as much rye picks.  I'm looking forward to finding a rum finish for either.  Thanks for the review.
That‚Äôs interesting.  I have a bottle of double rye! That when I first opened I disliked so much I‚Äôve never gone back to it.  It‚Äôs probably been open for a solid 6 months, maybe I‚Äôll give it another shot.
R/bourbon: the only place on the internet where men's men can use the word ""yummy"" and nobody bats an eyelash.
How would you say this compares to Angel's Envy Rye? 
Thanks! Gotta love all that minty and spice-ey Rye flavor. Did you have this same Hi-Time store pick, or are you talking about the standard Double Rye?
You obviously don't know me very well, because I use yummy irl all the time haha
I haven't had Angel's Envy Rye before, sorry
I'm not making fun of you, I use all kinds of descriptors in my reviews that wouldn't fly except in whiskey drinking circles. I was just reading this review and caught myself chuckling at that thought.

*****

**Russel's Reserve Single Barrel, Tippins Market pick, 55%**

**Nose:** That familiar Russel's Reserve Nose that I'm starting to love. It's big and it perfectly embodies the dark, rich, and soft side of Bourbon. Chocolate, rich mahogany, brown sugar with warm orange, musty wood, vanilla, plenty of smooth toasted wood, some menthol and slight spice. Just a hint of sweet cherry

**Taste:** Peppery spice and clove hit for a nice spicy opener, then it brightens up just a little with rich maple and brown sugar. Nice chocolatey wood that isn't remotely charred or tannic, tinny caramel, Wild Turkey musty wood funk, orange, hot cherry. 

**Finish:** Smooth chocolate and vanilla, cherry sweetness, and a nice clove spice that tingles all the way down.

*****

I haven't found huge variation with Russel's Reserve picks, but that's ok because they always satisfy. And they always have a delicious kind of signature flavor to them that I have trouble nailing down. This one is pretty typical from my limited experience: Very rich and drinkable with lots of darker toasted wood notes and a rich, smooth sweetness. It's a bit spicy too, and it works very well.

This bottle was the collaborative pick with a few local bars. It‚Äôs a damn good bottle. I have 5 RR picks and this is my favorite. Tippins is well known for their picks, especially their OWA and FR picks which sell for hundreds on secondary. Great review! 
When I tasted this selection at their store, I said instantly ""Cherry"".  We purchased a bottle and opened just before New Years, and have had only one round with it.  A classic lucky find.  I think it a lot better than my usual RR SiB's, which I've always liked.
Very cool, never heard of them but I'm glad I got to taste these couple of picks recently. I have their latest Knob Creek pick coming, I just reviewed a different one and it was fantastic: https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/apo8i4/review_63_knob_creek_single_barrel_bourbon/

I think Russel's Reserve is just awesome in general. We've got K&L over here, and despite the store's reputation I find their picks can be hit or miss for me. But I have yet to have a RR from them that wasn't delicious.
A lot of times when I get cherry in a whiskey it's more of a hot, cough syrup kind of thing. But this was like candy. 

I just had a knob creek SiB pick from tippins too, and it was fantastic. Have you had other stuff from this store? Do they generally do picks this good?
As far as other selections, not recently.  A few years ago I had 4 Roses and Kentucky Spirit ones, and more recently, a HW rye one.  That is not enough to draw a useful conclusion.  But they have a good rep for picks and go to KY for at least some of them.  They tend to up-price their selections over the same non-selections.  I visit AA 3x a year or so.
My experience with Tippins picks is very positive, I have a NCF OWA from him that‚Äôs excellent."
"Review #81, Port Charlotte 10 ""second limited edition""",,https://i.redd.it/ftrii3iwo7i21.jpg,"A little background on this: A few years back, Bruichladdich distillery went through a crisis of diminished aging stock. As a result, their age-stated Port Charlotte and Laddie Scotches were discontinued and replaced with NAS versions, which they promised were temporary until stocks were replenished. Then recently, as a show of good faith, Good guy Bruichladdich released limited edition bottlings of both Bruichladdich and Port Charlotte with a 10 year age statement, which they called the ""2nd limited editions."" This is a review of the Port Charlotte ""good faith"" 2nd limited edition. 

P.S. They have since honored their promise to restore age statements on the Port Charlotte, with a permanent 10yr bottling in a funny looking bottle now available. Here's hoping The Laddie follows suit

*****

**Port Charlotte 10yr, ""second limited edition,"" 50%**

**Nose:** Fruity and lively with huge friendly peat and vanilla. It's a clean medicinal peat that is Islay-huge, yet melds beautifully and doesn't dominate. Tons(and tons) of vanilla, chocolate, tart berry, green apple, rich caramel, malt, strawberry, menthol, charred wood, brine. It smells peaty and fruity and fun with a big vanilla embrace

**Taste:** Warm vanilla with big phenolic Islay peat. The phenolic peat is huge and clean and so delicious, yet feels very natural and friendly without being too heavy-handed. Sharp caramel and fun fruity flavors emerge, tart berry, sweet vanilla, perfect Islay brine, chocolate covered strawberry, still more vanilla, cake frosting.

**Finish:** Charred wood, sweet vanilla, and beautiful, beautiful phenolic peat. It all melds in a warm, friendly way, best way to describe it is ""brightly dark""(I know that doesn't make sense). Leaves you feeling so right.

*****

This is so good and sweet that it feels like it's cheating, kind of like a pastry stout. It has a characteristic huge and phenolic Islay peat, but it manages to be fun and fruity too, and with a warm embrace of sweet vanilla and smooth chocolate. All these flavors meld into a smooth mouthfeel that moves along in a friendly and effortless way. The result is a very unique and fun Islay peat monster. 

I tend to love what Bruichladdich does, and I am admittedly biased when it comes to this distillery. This is another Scotch that makes me feel like that bias is justified. Yay Scotch, and yay Bruichladdich!

thats weird, didnt know the first one was a limited edition
Nice review. Found a bottle in Europe (I'm in US), had to pull the trigger. I've hooked on Lagavulin the past 5 months, I need find something else and this sound like it is it. I like the sound of the way the peat is integrated. 
Nice review!

I had a bottle of this as well and enjoyed the hell out of it. I can totally get behind you on the ‚Äútart berry‚Äù notes, and the peat weaves in and is so well balanced. Bruichladdich gets it right. Need to get the new PC 10 year to see how it compares. 
Looks like this one has long passed from the market place.  Sorry I missed it.  Congrats on getting a shot at it.
I think it is meant more along the lines of ""second edition, and it's limited."" 

I admit I don't know much about an original 10yr Port Charlotte, but this is the case with The Laddie 10 and I assume this one is the same. Somebody can correct me if I'm wrong.
Don't get me wrong it's still a peat monster. It's just that it blends a lot of complex flavors really well. I think it's a safe bet that if you like Lagavulin you will like this though. 
They do a really good job of integrating the wine influence into their Whisky, it's never just an obvious and heavy handed ""wine finish"" with this and the Laddie. Thanks for reading!
Yeah this was released in 2017 I think. But they have since relaunched the standard 10yr Port Charlotte, it's now a permanent part of Bruichladdich's lineup. I haven't had it and can't say how it compares to this one though.

[This is it here](https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/bruichladdich/port-charlotte-10-year-old-whisky/), it comes in a pretty distinct bottle.
Different bottle shape, but when u said ""Port Charlotte 10"", this is the first thing that came to mind: [https://www.whiskynotes.be/2018/bruichladdich/port-charlotte-10-years-2018/](https://www.whiskynotes.be/2018/bruichladdich/port-charlotte-10-years-2018/)

&#x200B;

the funny thing is that bottle was just released about 7 months ago in July.  Makes me want to buy another PC 10 now that it might be limited (lmao).   great marketing ploy
The new standard release is nowhere near as good as the 2nd limited edition, in my opinion.  Still a solid whisky, but the 2nd edition was fantastic.
The new Port Charlotte 10 isn't limited and is now part of their core line. It's replacing the NAS [Port Charlotte Scottish Barley](https://www.bruichladdich.com/laddie-shop/port-charlotte-archive/port-charlotte-scottish-barley/)
Sorry, my wording was a little confusing. So the releases went like this: 

* Original Port Charlotte 10, which was discontinued  -> 

* Port Charlotte Islay Barley & Port Charlotte Scottish Barley, both are NAS replacements and still available ->

* Port Charlotte 10 ""second limited edition,"" the one I reviewed ->

* Port Charlotte 10 relaunch, the current bottle that you linked above.

The original Port Charlotte that was discontinued years ago is the one I haven't had and don't know much about. 


That's what I've heard. I kind of wish I had just bought it when it first was released and my excitement level was still high haha. I have high hopes for a 10yr Laddie though whenever they get around to it.
weird - the boxes are exactly the same.  but thx for the info plumhead

Yeah, once you get into the cask strength PC's its a whole new can of worms haha. I didn't want to further confuse the issue"
"Review #65, Four Roses OESK, Hi-Time Wine",,https://i.redd.it/sp05feszj5h21.jpg,"Thanks for the excellent review - I‚Äôve been pondering this bottle for a while and appreciate your take on it!
It's rare that I add water to full proof Bourbon, and especially rare that I add any to a Four Roses Private Select, which is some of my favorite Bourbon out there. I was feeling it needed it tonight so I did 2 reviews, one neat and one with some water added. I added a 1/2 tsp to a 1oz pour, which according to [my math](https://www.straightbourbon.com/calculator/) dropped the ABV from 58% to 54%. Doesn't sound like much but it definitely made a difference. These were not done sided by side.

*****

**Four Roses Private Selection OESK, HiTime Wine, 9yr 4mo, 58% (Neat)**

**Nose:** Lots of earthy, musty wood funk and super chocolatey charred oak initially. Rich toffee, smoother chocolate, vanilla pudding, nice undertone of clove spice and pepper.

**Taste:** It's a spicy one! Bit of a disconnect from that musty nose. Bright hot cherry and cinnamon flashes, with peppery spice. Settles down into creamy toffee, chocolate, sweet candy cherry, soft toasted wood. One of the things I usually love about these are the perfectly executed toasted barrel notes, but the char is kind of thin and lacking here.

**Finish:** Smoother on the finish. Creamy caramel and butterscotch with a very nice clove spice that rides out long

 * Not as charred or toasted as these usually are, it's dark and rich in an earthy/musty way. Takes you on quite the ride with lots of hot spice in there too. It's a little too hot and all over the place, the more pleasant notes never quite take hold imo. Not bad by any means, but not quite up to the usual FRPS(or HiTime) standards for my tastes.

*****

**Four Roses Private Selection OESK, HiTime Wine, 9yr 4mo, ~~58%~~54% (Water added)**

**Nose:** The wood is still in the forefront, but the funk has been tamed to a general toasted woodiness and more creamier chocolate has come out. It has a softer nose all around with toffee, butterscotch, friendly char, chocolate, the spice has diminished to a kind of menthol feeling in the nose.

**Taste:** Much mellower and more quiet on the palate. Cherry cough syrup and mild cinnamon spice are on the front of the palate, but softer and not so violently hot. Transitions nicely into milder black cherry, creamy caramel, fudge, nice wood that is even less charred now, menthol and clove spice. It's creamier and friendlier, the flavors all meld better for sure.

**Finish:** Sweet cherry and cinnamon with a mild peppery spice. The finish isn't as long or powerful, but again it's more friendly and balanced. Much sweeter too.

*****

**Conclusion:** The small amount of water was perfect, even then it was almost too watered down. Bottom line, I found this Bourbon to be more enjoyable with some water added. It wasn't such a hot mess, it was much more friendly and well balanced. It tamed some of the unpleasant barrel funk/must and brought out the nicer flavors such as the smooth caramel and creamy chocolate. The hot spice that had dominated got cooled down into a pleasant menthol and clove.

But here's the thing that kind of complicates it, I'm not really looking for ""balance"" and a ""friendly"" drinking experience with FRPS. I enjoy that hot, spicy, vibrant assault on the senses. It is like a cacaphony of flavors that all work beautifully together, or as the saying goes ""a party in my mouth and everyone's invited."" This is especially noticeable on the finish, which is lacking on the water-added pour.


**TL;DR** On this particular night I preferred this bottle with some water added, but I would rather have a Four Roses that delivered at full proof. 

**Score:**

Neat: **6**

Water: **7**

You‚Äôre awesome!!!
I have no clue how you taste or smell so many notes!!!

I hate bourbon, but my husband loves it, but he has yet to distinguish ‚Äúnotes‚Äù (even flavor profiles), and it‚Äôs been over a year since he started Bourbon.  

Husband wanted me to try a new bourbon although he knows I despise it.  I took it from him to do so, and for the first time ever, I got passed the alcohol smell and actually found a note of vanilla arising. How do you learn to get to these notes in tasting and smelling?  It amazes me one can!!! I almost had to offer myself up a drink just because I was so thrilled I smelled ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù after I passed through the alcohol smell. 

Again, thank you for the awesome post!  I‚Äôll share with hubby. 
Thanks for posting.   Love that you included the calculator 
Hands down my favorite!!
Thanks for reading! Honestly I don't know if my review comes across as a recommendation or not haha, but I'm glad you found it informative. I did enjoy this bottle though, even if it did have some shortcomings. 
""Not bad by any means, but not quite up to the usual FRPS(or HiTime) standards for my tastes.""

&#x200B;

As some who has enjoyed bottles from several FRPS and HiTime barrels, I agree.  Between this and other FRPS I've had recently, not to mention the price hike, I'm less inclined to assume that these picks are always gold, even from a reputable source.
Thanks for reading, I'm loving the enthusiasm. Vanilla is definitely one of the easier and more distinguishable notes to pick up. Not all bourbons have it very strong, but when its there it's very apparent. Barrel char is like that too, theres nothing quite like drinking charred wood.

Honestly reviewing and picking apart a whiskey is still a challenge, that's one of the things I enjoy about it. Sometimes certain notes don't jump out at me until I actually sit down to review it. If you're interested then google ""whiskey flavor wheel"" or ""Bourbon flavor wheel."" Also search this sub for reviews on a bourbon that you're drinking, see if you can identify with any notes being described. You may have to search through several reviews of the same bourbon to find a reviewer who's tastes or descriptions line up with yours. Theres a Whiskey review archive on the sidebar that can help you with this. 
Sure thing, thanks for reading. The calculator is kind of fun to experiment with.
>I'm less inclined to assume that these picks are always gold

I don't know, theres always been an element of risk buying these or any single barrel Whiskey. Even from a reputable source there's different flavor profiles and styles that one person may like while another doesn't.

I still think these FRPS's are a much safer bet then lots of other stuff, and it will take more than one bottle to make me write off a store like HiTime that I have lots of good experiences with. 
Thank you for your wonderful and informative reply!!!  (I will also show this to the hubs.) 

Can we just hire you out for sniffing? Tasting?  Lol 
Just kidding! 

Have a wonderful evening!  
I grant your point about variety of tastes & barrels both, especially when it comes to Four Roses.  Still, my point is that Four Roses' PS SiB has dipped in quality:

What other readily available SiB brands in the $70-$80 price would you compare to FRPS?  Maybe I'm focusing too much on value vs. quality, but Russell's Reserve (bourbon or rye) offers comparable single barrels for less, not to mention Knob Creek at an even lower price point.
>Can we just hire you out for sniffing? Tasting?

Hey, if you supply the Whiskey then I'm available! ;)
Yeah, if you feel Four Roses is dipping in quality overall, that's a fair point. I don't think I've noticed that, but sometimes I'm pulling bottles out of my stash that are a few years old so it's hard to say for sure.

As far as making comparisons, I haven't found anything that really provides a similar experience to FRPS. RR is delicious stuff for sure, but it's a completely different profile. Knob Creek comes closer, but they tend to be quite a bit oakier and sleeker from what I've had(possibly due to the age). There's ECBP, that's more of an ""oaky juggernaut"" to me. Four Roses just has this brashness and vibrancy that I really love. I don't worry about the age decreasing either, some of my absolute favorites were only 8-9 years old and I've had 10-12 year bottles that were kind of boring. 

TL;DR Who knows, you could be right about Four Roses quality dipping. But I haven't personally seen anything that raises alarm bells for me.
Sounds like a plan!!
Have a great one!

"Review #64, WhistlePig 10yr single barrel, France44",,https://i.redd.it/j21o43rueug21.jpg,"This barrel was 13 years old according to the store, and is courtesy of u/toadpooh. When asked, the picker said he doesn't know whether it is MGP or Alberta Rye, but in the end all I care about is how good it is.

*****


**WhistlePig 10yr single barrel, France44 pick, 55.5%**

**Nose:** Creamy butterscotch and cinnamon, a healthy dose of musty toasted wood, smooth dark minty rye, cherry sweetness, rich caramel, peppery spice.

**Taste:** Rich caramel and cherry syrup with coooool minty rye, tannic and funky wood, cinnamon, crisp green apple and fruits, creamy butterscotch, friendly peppery spice, smooth toasted oak

**Finish:** Sweet cherry, cinnamon, big menthol and minty Rye. A very crisp and minty cherry finish

*****

This one was a little too closed and tannic for a while after opening it, but it is starting to open up very nicely now. It still has a bit of the bitter and tannic wood funk, but the Whiskey on whole is good enough and complex enough that it doesn't hurt it too much. The cherry sweetness and crisp green apple works well with the toasted wood and dark creaminess, and it has that beautifully balanced and well integrated minty Rye spice that pervades nicely. Honestly I was worried about this one for a while, but it's turning out to be another winner.

Have you tried the other barrel they got at the same time?
u/Stefan__1985 you might be interested in this one
France 44 in Minneapolis?
Great review buddy! I need to revisit my MGP pick.. good thing is the floor of those WP picks are pretty high
Hey! I have that same poster/print!
Whistlepig confirmed that this is a 13 year MGP.
No, I have it but I haven't opened it yet. That one actually sounds more up my alley, being higher ABV (61.3%) and the spicier of the 2 according to their description. Have you had it?
Yep, that's the one
I dont remember, do you have this one? How is that multi bottle comparison going? 
Do you have a source? Not that I don't believe you, just wondering where you heard. My friend talked with the guy who did the actual picking, and he didnt know for sure.

Also this bottle was just one of two different 13yr picks they did at the same time, are they both MGP? 
I have. I think I like the 61.3 slightly better- it‚Äôs closer to the normal WP profile I‚Äôm used to, but more refined and balanced than most of the other store picks I‚Äôve had. I liked that 55.5 had a different profile, and it was nice that they had some differences. Definitely a good choice to get both- France 44 does a good job making picks.
Great store! I really like that they'll let you taste anything they have
No, I could not get that one ;) But I have several other 13y MGP ones. Not even started that comparison... I'm still working on my MGP Bourbon comparison :) I'll keep you posted when I do the comparison.
>Definitely a good choice to get both

Implying there's a choice, lol. Seriously though I love this stuff and buy as many different picks as I can get my hands on. So that's good to hear that my guesswork may have been right on that other pick being the better of the 2. I've never had a bad bottle though, so they are a pretty safe bet imo. 
Several places I went to in minneapolis let you taste stuff, the town has a lot of cool stores. I think south lyndale had just about every bottle being sold available to taste. Unfortunately I didn't want to drink though since I was driving in an unfamiliar city.
Agreed- the Whistlepig picks and Four Roses picks are the two I buy every time I see a new one. Total Wine got a pick around the same time F44 did, and the F44 picks both blew the Total Wine one away... but I liked that one too and was glad I bought it.
Those are my two main stores. South lyndale does store picks fairly often. Ace spirits is supposedly really good and they have a four roses store pick coming soon. The owner was there in January selecting it. 
If you like WP and FR picks, you might enjoy [my recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Whiskyporn/comments/ahzc5i/just_visited_minneapolis_im_impressed_with_the/) from when I visited Minneapolis. I'm actually from California, and I found lots of cool stuff out there. I wish I could have brought back more!
Yeah, Ace does some good picks as well, and they always have quite a few. Their last Four Roses pick was a 13 year and sold out in a day.
Nice! Is the 3rd WP from South Lyndale? I have that one but haven‚Äôt opened it yet. Looks like you got the Haskell‚Äôs FR pick, but where is the other one from? I don‚Äôt think I have that one
Yep, those are the ones. The other Four Roses is from some store that a friend local to the area told me about, I don't know if I should broadcast it here
Fair enough- I know of a couple others, so I could probably figure it out. Glad you enjoyed your time in Minneapolis!"
"Review #63, Knob Creek Single Barrel Bourbon, Tippins Market",,https://i.redd.it/lgehtmsjs1g21.jpg,"sample courtesy of u/RudolphSchmidt

**Knob Creek Single Barrel Bourbon, Tippins Market, 14yr 6mo, 60%**

**Nose:** Deeply huge toasted wood. Like, *perfectly* toasted wood. Not tannic, or super-charred, or overly woody, no hint of must or funk, just the definition of perfectly toasted Bourbon-y oak. There's chocolate, tobacco, dark fruits, menthol spice, burnt sticky maple, but all these flavors just dance around with the huge toasted oak that defines this nose

**Taste:** That same huge, clean oakiness translates perfectly to the taste. But even with the huge wood notes it is fun, bright and nimble on the palate. Darkly sweet caramel and huge toasted oak, burnt maple, metallic sweetness, warm orange zest, fruity cherry, the perfect amount of mouth-tingling spice. Just wow.

**Finish:** Plenty of oak that gets more and more charred, but sweet burnt toffee and caramel take over on the finish with tons of lovely spice

*****

I don't have a lot of experience with Knob Creek, I think I need to change that because this is beautiful. Everything this Bourbon does, it does so fucking well. I'm in awe, I've never had something so goddamn oaky that can still be so bright and fun tasting. It's such a wonderful oakiness too, it never gets overly rich or dark but just maintains a fun and pleasant toasted character from nose to finish. This stuff is sweet, dark, toasted, bright and burnt all in one, so much fun. 

P.S.-Oh and I was so busy enjoying it I didn't even think about the fact that this is 60% ABV, which goes to show how delicious and drinkable it is.

The thing that annoys me the most about this review is not the review itself, but the fact that I went to school at UMich very recently and had no idea this store was there. It's probably closer than even the Liquor Castle to where I used to live. I'm terribly jealous!
Thanks for the review! Do you know if this had a barrel number? Tippins has put out several KCSB picks and was curious if you knew specifically which one you reviewed. 
Those 14yr picks can really be something. Tasted one a few months ago and had to go and get a bunch more. 
What did this bottle run you? I think I need to pick some up.
These 14 yr KC store picks have been amazing. I'm on my 3rd bottle, all different barrels and stores, but all phenomenal. Really one of the best values available in bourbon right now. 
Damnit man!  Don't you know the first rule of KC Sib Club is that we don't talk about KC Sib Club?  These things won't stay underrated for much longer.  Nice review!
Sorry I don't know, just that it's 14yr 6mo old. And thanks for reading!
14y 6m WH-W Floor 3. 

That's all the info on the bottle. 
I think this was thier ""Cowbell Pick""  (sticker had the skit from SNL on it). They released anothe pick at the same time called ""Peanut Butter"" which I tasted side by side and actually preferred. That was just over 10 years I believe but my bottle is up north and I cant check. 
Yeah, it's terrible whiskey. No one likes it. Leave it on the shelf (for me to take).
Oops. I just loved it so much I had to shout it from the hilltops haha. I've had it and enjoyed it before, but never had one quite this good.
How long ago did you pick the bottle up? Would love to swing by Tippins and see if they still have a bottle. 
Thanks. I swear they had a KC store pick a couple weeks ago when I was there, just not sure if it‚Äôs the same one. Probably not. 
They had it about 4 or 5 months ago. 
Worth picking up anyway. I haven't had a 14 yr one that was disappointing yet "

**Nose:** Rich clean smoke, but far from being a peat assault. Light caramel and vanilla, mild charred wood, some slight menthol. Everything about this nose is light and reserved

**Taste:** Clean and reserved, delicate almost. It has a clean, gleaming caramel quality to it, with a smoky background that intertwines rather than laying over everything. Actually it almost tastes like a blend with just a mild smoke influence. Very light floral sweetness, sweet vanilla icing, nothing remotely rich or dark here.

**Finish:** Not a huge finish, delicate caramel and vanilla icing with very mild charred smoke

*****

My experience with Bowmore IB's is that they are a much mellower and smoother peat than most other Islays, but this bottle takes it to an extreme. This goes beyond passive-aggressive descriptors like ""smooth"" and ""elegant,"" and goes into ""delicate"" territory. There's nothing really offensive or bad here, and even though I am kind of a peat-fiend I don't mind some light smoke now and then. But this is just so delicate and light that it tastes like it's barely there. It does get slightly richer with some significant air time, and it might have it's place for people who are not as into smoke. I only paid about $60, and really it's not bad for that price.

**Nose:** Deliciously ashy and charred peat, sweet vanilla, mineral funk, milk chocolate, root beer char, nose-tingling menthol. Dark, charred and mean peat on the nose, it's real nice.

**Taste:** ...aaand much friendlier and softer on the palate. Smooth rich caramel and malt, milk chocolate, clean friendly smoke, lots of sweet vanilla, a mild kind of sweet fruitiness. There's some char and ash but it's mild and in the background. This Scotch gets thicker and richer with more air, I'm enjoying it more and more the longer it sits out. 

**Finish:** Sweet and floral with strong friendly peat and caramel, leaves with a very mild char. Sweet and pleasant.

*****

I admit I have a bias with Ardmore: I want to imagine a highland peated malt as a lighter and friendlier smoke. The nose contradicts this with a very mean and charred peat, but then the taste safely re-affirms my preconceptions. To put it another way it's orc-smoke on the nose, but hobbit-smoke on the palate. I enjoy both styles of smoke just fine, but feel like I might enjoy this Scotch a little more if the nose and taste agreed more. That sounds incredibly picky, but hey I can be picky when I'm paying almost $10 per year. A fine dram though.

>orc-smoke on the nose, but hobbit-smoke on the palate

SMWS Name: ""Ted Sandyman's New Mill""

I'm curious, has this malt evolved in any notable way since you opened the bottle? Asking because in my experience aggressive notes on the nose are often the first thing to start fading with extended oxidation (i.e. years), which might be interesting with this bottle given that the nose and palate are clashing with each other.

Nice review, cheers.
Oh shit, Ted Sandyman is an obscure enough reference to know that you are a real Tolkien fan. We just became best friends haha.

Thanks for reading! I tend to really notice and pick apart a Scotch much more once I sit down to review it, it's one of the things I enjoy about doing this. It's been open for almost 3 months and my impression before reviewing was an overly friendly and soft peat. So honestly if anything I notice the intensity of the nose more now. With this review I can revisit down the road, because I don't see this bottle going quickly.
>obscure enough reference to know that you are a real Tolkien fan

That would be correct. In addition to the primary texts I've got the whole History of M.E. series published by Christopher T., as well as Tom Shippey's books. So yes, best friends.

>because I don't see this bottle going quickly

That may be for the best. I'm guessing this might be a very interesting bottle to check back on periodically, say every 6 months or so, for a period of several years.
I've dabbled in History of M.E., I feel like they are more interesting as a window into the writing and creation process, not as much for the lore. Mostly I've just done the Hobbit, LOTR, and The Silmarillion, but many many times over the years. Shoutout to the Appendices too, I go back and read them on their own sometimes. I even have a cd of the appendices I burned from an audiobook, love to pop it in when I'm driving sometimes haha.
> they are more interesting as a window into the writing and creation process, not as much for the lore

I agree with that. I got about a half dozen volumes in and sort of lost the plot, but figured *in for a penny, in for a pound* and decided to stick it out to the end. But as an insight into the creative process I found it fascinating.

Tom Shippey's books have been very rewarding, especially *Author of the Century*, in cross-fertilizing some ideas in the area of one of my other reading hobbies - modern European history.
Yeah, I got into the letters, really enjoyed that insight into Tolkien's mind. Other than that I've pretty much stuck to treating middle earth lore as actual history haha. I also love Fonstad's Atlas of Middle Earth. A few of the maps aren't 100% accurate(I think Eriador particularly), but its invaluable and a lot of fun to thumb through or use during a re-read.

"Review #62, Old Overholt Bonded Rye",,https://i.redd.it/7k2onrz36of21.jpg,"**Old Overholt bonded Rye, 50%****

**Nose:** Light and pleasant. Clean menthol rye and oregano. Light and smooth bourbon-y notes of vanilla, caramel, mellow barrel char. Wet cardboard. 

**Taste:** Zing of Bourbon corn with sweet vanilla and smooth toffee, very mild spice, lightly toasted oak. Light Rye that lends more of a menthol-y ""feeling"" rather than outright flavor. Pleasant and inoffensive, but lacks any real punch or wow factor.

**Finish:** Sweet finish with basic Bourbon corn and more of that clean ""background"" menthol and rye spice

A little too sleek and smooth for my tastes, ends up being kind of boring. It's also very Bourbony which is a big turn-off for me with Rye. I don't mind a spicy high Rye Bourbon, but when I'm drinking a Rye I want it to taste like a goddamn RYE. This tastes like a very smooth and light Bourbon with some minty Rye background noise. Overall it is pleasant and well executed though, especially for the price, so I think I will score it a little higher than my actual enjoyment level.

Yeah I prefer Rittenhouse for a bonded rye, but Overholt is totally fine, especially for the money. Definitely fine to cocktail with or to shoot, but in both situations I‚Äôd still be more prone to go for the Rittenhouse 
Big fan of Old Overholt, and a bigger fan of the OO Bonded. I agree it‚Äôs very much like drinking a high rye bourbon, though at the end of the day I may just be less inclined to hold that against it.
What‚Äôs the poster in the background? I‚Äôm fascinated by it. 
I like Rittenhouse better than this stuff for sure, but it's still too Bourbony of a Rye for my tastes. If anything the Overholt has more Rye flavor to it imo.

*****

**Four Roses Private Select OBSQ, McScrooge's Wine and Spirits, 8yr 5mo, 60.2%**

**Nose:** Classic FRPS nose, a bit on the dark side though. Clean rich caramel and cherry syrup zing, darkly burnt wood char, cocao fudge, vanilla(which I don't usually get in these), thick spice that pops clean and bright, spicy and floral with sharp corn.

**Taste:** Dark and rich, but it slowly builds big and spicy and sweet. Dark burnt caramel and molasses with tannic wood, cherry cough syrup, sticky toffee, dark and rich rye spice, brighter fruit sweetness. The dark caramel and toffee is thick and sludgy, mixes well with the brighter flavors of sweetly rich fruit and spice. Besides the deliciousness, these competing light and dark notes also make for an interesting and engaging mouthfeel.

**Finish:** Perfect toasted oak and rich sweet black cherry, slowly builds brighter from the initial taste and lingers nicely.

*****

Another great bottle of FRPS. I tend to prefer these more bright and fun, so this one is a little different but works really well. It has a nice mix of dark, rich burnt flavor and brighter sweetness, and a really nice thick and rich rye spice. Well balanced and even-keeled for a FRPS(especially for being 60% ABV), but still maintains a nice complexity.

**Taste:** Brash cinnamon red-hot and Rye spice hit strongly, first impression is that it's quite hot and not as interesting as the nose. Some nicer flavors emerge as it calms down, Vanilla and caramel, buttery pastry, clean smooth Rye spice. Nothing that is outright ""bad"" or unpleasant, but kind of thin and overly hot. With quite a bit of air it gets a little more bright and pleasant.

**Finish:** Hot cinnamon and Rye spice with some caramel and cherry. Long, hot finish

*****

I've gone through quite a few of these SiB store picks now, it is generally some of my favorite Whiskey around. This might be the weakest bottle I've had by those high standards. To be honest I was pretty disappointed when I first opened it, but it's still a solid Rye and has actually come a long way since then. It was thin and had some funky notes and wood must thing going on. While it's still on the thin and hot side, the flavors have evened out a little and there's some good stuff here. It gets much nicer after the glass has sat out for a good while(like a good 30min), and some water does help it out, enough to bump the score up a notch. FWIW a [different Bevmo pick](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/96n7uo/reviews_5253_stagecoach_and_bevmo_whistlepig_sibs/) happened to be one of my all time favorite bottles of WhistlePig.

"Reviews #58/59, Binny's and Bevmo Bone Snapper Rye picks",,https://i.redd.it/asel451wcfe21.jpg,"Don't know much about ""Backbone Bourbon Company"" other than the fact they bottle some Barrel proof MGP Rye in the form of Bone Snapper. And being a huge fan of MGP Rye, that's enough to get my attention. ~~I don't think there's anything older than 4 years~~, and my Bevmo bottle is actually only about 3.5 years, which might be indicative of the current high demand for this juice. Nice of them to give us an age statement though on something so young, and the stuff only goes for about $60 which is a pretty good price imo.

*****

**Bone Snapper 4yr Rye, Binnys single barrel, 55%**

**Nose:** Yummy Rye goodness, I can already tell. Rich toffee, buttery cream, chocolate. Rye pervades with lots of nose-tingling menthol and peppermint. Healthy dose of charred wood with lots of funk, light apple fruitiness

**Taste:** Total MGP Rye. Clean, gleaming caramel and toffee with bold dill and minty Rye spice. Sweet brown sugar, clean toasted oak, a subdued fun fruitiness.

**Finish:** Sweet hot cherry and toasted caramel with nice minty Rye. Leaves with mouth numbing menthol

This is a lovely Rye, it reminds me why I love that 95% MGP so much. It's creamy and rich, and the Rye is less spicy and more mint/menthol. The toasted wood notes are on point. All the flavors meld beautifully. It lacks a little bit of the oomph of the great MGP Ryes like Willett and SAOS, and it's a little heavy on the musty wood funk, but these are minor complaints at this price point. All the delicious flavor I look for in a Rye is here and it totally satisfies my Rye-lust.

Score: **7**

*****

**Bone Snapper Rye single barrel, Bevmo pick, 3yr 7mo, 58.2%**

**Nose:** Fiercely oaky and charred with brash Rye spice, dark burnt caramel, tobacco, gritty brown sugar, peppery and minty Rye. Despite all the darker tannic wood notes it is kind of thin and washed out on the nose.

**Taste:** Lively and hot on the palate. Burnt sticky caramel and cherry red-hots, cinnamon, lots of intense peppery and spicy rye. A nice backbone of darker toasted oak, gritty brown sugar, toffee. Some pastry sweetness manages to peak through all the heat.

**Finish:** Toasted brown sugar sweetness with cherry red-hots and cinnamon, plenty of mouth-numbing peppery Rye. Very hot and action packed.

This Rye is hot and spicy and kind of all over the place. It's super oaky and charred for such a young Whiskey, which works very well with the minty and peppery Rye. Lots of great flavors that I usually crave in a Rye but it never totally comes together here. It's fun, interesting and action packed though, and plenty enjoyable. I should note that I'm finding it needs lots of air and time to shine: It becomes very nice after 20 minutes or so compared to the hot mess it is when first poured, and it's gotten much better after being opened for a few weeks compared to the first pour. Impressive for such a young Whiskey, and I'm finding it hits the spot for me the more I drink it.

I did a similar side by side but my picks were 4y 10m. I liked them a lot. 
Thanks for the review. Some Binny's locations still have these in stock, so I think I'll grab one.
I should have gone after that or the X-ray in Chi when I had the chance.  Since Backbone Co. (and Binny's - lol) has some staying power I may have another chance sometime.  Thanks for a good review.  I was tasting along with you in my mind.
Thanks for the review! I just picked up a 5yr 7mo pick of these from BevMo yesterday for $45 after a $10 off coupon. Thought it was a steal and your review seems to confirm that :)
Thanks, and thanks for reading! The Binny's pick definitely feels like the more ""finished"" and well-balanced Whiskey of the 2. But FYI I got this sample back in May 2018, so I can't say if this is the same bottle they currently have. 
Wow, that's quite a bit older than the one I found. Have you tried it yet? Love to hear your thoughts on it. "

Got Campbeltown covered right now,,https://i.redd.it/3ejq5yoy39d21.jpg,"For anyone wondering, this covers the only three distilleries left in the once booming Whisky region of Campbeltown. What Campbeltown has lost in quantity they make up for in quality, because these are all fantastic. Springbank needs no introduction. The Glen Scotia took me a bit to warm up to but has opened up very rich and elegant and is quite nice. The Kilkerran has been amazing from the get-go and is probably my favorite of the 3. 
Nice choices. 
All fantastic whiskies. Campbeltown is right in my sweet-spot
I love that Glen Scotia 15. A trip to Edinburgh back in 2017 resulted in me bringing home about a dozen bottles. One that I didn‚Äôt get that I truly regret is that Glen Scotia 15.  Really great and priced right. 
3 great pours there.

Part of me wishes that the apocryphal ""*pickled herring barrel*"" story about the crazy days in Campbeltown just before the bust were actually true. Can you imagine how whisky geeks would react if surviving bottles turned up of something like that? The tasting notes on whiskyfun would be epic.
I'm not familiar with this story so I looked it up, found this:

>The demand for whisky at the early part of the 20th century drove Campbeltown productions rates so high that impurities were carried over into the final spirit, as corners were cut and quality inevitably dropped. This led to a fishy smell that Frank McHardy, of Springbank, describes as having people accusing the Campbeltown distilleries of ‚Äúmaturing the spirit in herring barrels because it tasted and smelt so fishy‚Äù.

Funny how a story like that might spread, true or not haha. SWA rules might not *specifically* forbid it, so who knows maybe someday we'll get a throwback ""Pickled Herring barrel"" Scotch from them. Interesting fact, thank you

"Just visited Minneapolis, I'm impressed with the variety of local picks",,https://i.redd.it/1zozbzyanlb21.jpg,"Not much variety.
A cool area with lots of interesting stores and barrel picks. Plenty of other stuff I wish I could have tried too, but luggage space was limited. Something else I'll say as a Californian visiting Minnesota in January, holy shit that weather is no joke. I learned the true meaning of the word ""cold."" 
What do you think we do all winter? We drink... a lot. 
Priced fairly there?
Which 4R recipes, asking out of curiosity? I can just make out a Q on the side of the leftmost one, the rest of it is a mystery. Looks like a really nice haul in any event.
WhistlePig straight rye is straight heaven
Where did you visit while you were in town? I know a lot of bartenders here. 
Gratulations my friend! Very nice haul
Dear god. Minneapolis in the winter? Are you mad, man? 
These 2 bottles are definitely my main priority haha, but I found plenty of other stuff too. Russel's Reserve, Knob Creek(Bourbon and Rye), lots of 1792, and other stuff I can't remember.
Glad you enjoyed our state! Barrel picks aren‚Äôt lacking here. Some great liquor stores with great availability at normal prices.

Come back in the summer - the couple months of summer are majestic and make up for ridiculous winters.
[deleted]
As long as it's indoors haha. It was really neat seeing all the frozen lakes out there too though. I saw a bigger lake that I assume people were fishing on, there were cars parked out on it and some kind of tents were set up. And smaller lakes with nets set up to play hockey. I knew that kind of stuff happens out there, still blew my mind to actually see it.
Id hope you can find this stuff anywhere.
Yeah prices were good. With the exception of one of the FRPS which was $80, these were all priced at the bottom end of what you see them going for in Cali. Prices on other stuff seemed good too.
Also curious which stores you found the 4R picks at...
An OBSF that is 8yr 9mo(58.1%), and an OESQ at 8yr 11mo(62.6%). I bought 2 of the OESQ after trying it, really liked it. 
Agreed, I'm a Rye fiend and love this stuff so much
Thanks, I knew you and Dixie would get a kick out of this.
It was a family thing that came up suddenly, had to go. I actually live in the mountains in California and we do get some snow and cold temps up here, but nothing that could prepare me for that Minnesota cold. Fuck me it was cold, and I definitely needed some better gear.
I went to South Lyndale and Haskell's and a few others, it was mostly just the amount of store selects that blew me away. I can get these picks in the L.A. area, but it's always the same couple of stores and it's all a lot more spread out. I think Bay area might be a little better though. Ace looks really cool too, I wanted to go but didn't get a chance. 
I wish, I have to drive out of my state for barrel strength 4R.
Cannot find the SiB barrel strength anywhere around me
Where'd you find the OESQ?
Sure :)) have you seen my WP family? See link at the other spot
Damn. My liquor stores have a dank selection then. By im in midwest so that helps
Thats sad.  4R is my favorite all variety‚Äôs and my liquor store has em all 
Holy shit dude, 15 if I'm counting right. That's no small feat over there in Europe. Just out of curiosity, what is the best and worst ones you've ever had? I just opened one that was a little disappointing, might be the worst I've ever had(still a decent rye though). But the best WP I've had was from the same place, Bevmo.
Best is really hard to say, i have a huge sbs planed.. the good bevmo from you is part of it. I have a very good spec pick and some good 13y mgp. I need to sbs them to be fair..
Worst i would say a blackwells pick and a total wine but thats just out of my head
Is the bevmo pick you have 59.7% ? That one might be the best bottle I've had. And the disappointing one I have now is 55.8%. I liked the totalwine pick I had, it was the first one I ever tried. They do a lot of picks though I think.
Yeah, it‚Äòs the 59.7% one :) did you had mgp wp‚Äòs? Of yes how would you rank those in the game?
Nice, hope you are enjoying it as much as I enjoyed mine. How many WP's are you doing for your sbs, and are you gonna post it? 

I've never had any that the store claimed as MGP. I often wonder if I would be able to pick one out and tell them apart. To me MGP has that dill flavor, and more fruity/candy sweetness, which I don't think I've found in a WP. But I had the Redemption 10yr Rye, and all those ""MGP"" flavors were tamed by richer wood flavor, so who knows. 

I just opened the France44 55.5% bottle. It is 13 years old, and really good. Probably the oakiest WP I've ever had. I think it needs a little more time to open up though.
I will, i had already a tiny sip of it, back when you reviewed it :)
The SbS will be 14 (8 samples and 6 open bottles).. i‚Äòm a lazy fucker with posting, if not i‚Äòll let you know my outcome! 
Some of the MGP WP smell/taste like the typical MGP dilly and others not. I could imagine it would be pretty hard to pick them blind. I can remember that france44 one üòÑ oaky but still spicy and sweet?"
"Review #78, Bruichladdich ""Laddie"" Scottish barley",,https://i.redd.it/poxr4n5iu7a21.jpg,"Note: bottle code is 16/187, you can enter it on [The Laddie webpage](https://www.bruichladdich.com/laddie-shop/bruichladdich/bruichladdich-the-classic-laddie/)(in the ""transparency recipe code"" box) to find batch info. This batch is made up of 7-10 year old barrels, 75% 1st fill Bourbon and 25% red wine barrels(Spanish ribera del duero and French rhone)

*****

**Bruichladdich ""The Classic Laddie"" Scottish barley, 50%**

**Nose:** The nose pops with crisp sweet malted barley, lots of pear and tart fruit. It has a real lively snap to it. Wine funk, wet wood, salted caramel.

**Taste:** Pops with brashly sweet malt and cake frosting, vanilla, fruity funk(or funky fruit), friendly brine, floral notes. It's complex and action packed, but it has a nice dessert-y creaminess to it at the same time. The signature Bruichladdich funk is definitely there, but tastes well integrated and works really well for me.

**Finish:** Warms up and evens out on the finish with sweet briny malt and vanilla

*****

I love this stuff, and Laddie will always hold a special place in my heart. The original 10yr was one of my early Scotch loves, and I was sad to see it go. This NAS Laddie is certainly no replacement, but I don't think it ever tried to be. Instead it does it's own thing and does it well. It uses its youth to it's advantage, being brash and lively with plenty of nice complexity and flavor. The wine funk is in a sweet spot where it adds an interesting element but still let's the sweet malt be the main attraction, and Islay brine is in there nicely too. There's really just nothing like a Laddie. And good guy Bruichladdich fully embraces and showcases all this craziness by bottling it at 50% and disclosing all the batch info. The only real downfall to me is that it is a little hot and astringent, especially when the bottle is first opened. But this review is from the bottom of the bottle after being open for quite a while, and I think that heat has mellowed a bit. Thanks for reading!

Ha, I like your unbiased scoring. This sounds quite good and that‚Äôs cool that you can look up the bottle info. Never had the original 10 but this sounds like a good bottle to have.
Thanks. I Edited the review to include a link to the Bruichladdich webpage if you wanna look it up, it's pretty interesting. 

The original 10yr was thicker and more balanced to me, a really good bottle. But I get a craving sometimes for that Laddie funk and this NAS Laddie still hits the spot. I did a sbs review of the 10yr, 2nd edition 10yr, and NAS Laddie [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/5yu1yz/the_laddie_10_old_and_new_reviews_789/) a while back if you're interested.

"Review #77, Staoisha 3yr(heavily peated Bunnahabhain), John Milroy K&L pick",,https://i.redd.it/mibqbz2d4q821.jpg,"**Staoishi(heavily peated Bunnahabhain) 3yr, John Milroy K&L pick, 2013/2017, refill barrel, 56%**

**Nose:** A combination of fresh young spirit and clean peat that doesn't dominate as much as I would think. Mineral peat, thin vanilla, ash, buttered popcorn, tart fruit, clean and sharp youthful spirit. 

**Taste:** Vanilla and earthy peat, tart green apple fruit, root beer char. There's plenty of new make flavor here too, it's hard to describe but it tastes fruity and metallic to me. The flavors are all pretty simple and easygoing, nothing jumps out as really huge or offensive. It gets much smoother and more balanced the longer it sits out, very nice.

**Finish:** Finish is surprisingly big actually, with sweet vanilla and warm, friendly charred peat.

*****

It definitely shows signs of it's youth with a kind of overly simple feel and plenty of new make flavor, but considering it's a 3 year old Scotch from a refill barrel it's really good. No individual flavors, good or bad, dominate or force their way to the forefront. So it ends up simply being super sharp and youthful charred peat goodness. An interesting experience where you can taste a lot of the base spirit, but at the same time you see the beginnings of all that big Islay vanilla and charred peat goodness that I love in older bottlings. Good stuff and worth every bit of the $35 it went for. 

I feel like I might score this higher if I tasted this blind and didn't know it was only 3 years old. But I didn't taste it blind and I do notice some of the more youthful notes, even though it was very enjoyable.

This was the best $ for value peated scotch in 2018, IMO.
Yeah it was definitely a great value. But I find myself reaching for it more as an ""interesting experiment"" as opposed to a straight up ""delicious Scotch."" It's fun to show people what such a young spirit is like. TotalWine has a 4 year peated Bunna I remember liking a lot more, I had it as a mystery sample. It was quite a while back though, and it goes for $55 so not as good of a value.

You aged some of this in a miniature port seasoned cask right? I read a pretty good mystery review of it from u/throwboats.
I did, yes...it turned out well. It married really nicely with the port. "

**Nose:** Butterscotch, honey, vanilla, green apple and pear, overall pleasant Bourbon barrel malt notes but with a pretty prominent kind of tart funk. Is this the waxiness everyone always talks about with Clynelish? It's almost off-putting but actually makes it interesting to me.

**Taste:** Sweet caramel malt, bright and tart fruitiness, vanilla, yummy pear, banana funk. It's somewhere between being a light, floral Scotch and a rich, heavy, robust Malt.

**Finish:** Sweet caramel and vanilla with light, pleasant fruitiness. A nice, easygoing finish

*****

I've really enjoyed this bottle so far, but I've gone back and forth on just how much. I loved it when I first opened it, had a few ""meh"" pours that were good but kind of boring, but today I'm back to loving it. Straightforward Bourbon barrel goodness that is on the lighter side, with a nice little bit of tart, bright, and happy sweetness. Not what I would call the ""malt bomb"" I'm usually after with these, but it's tasty and has a unique character that I'm digging.

Nice review. Sounds interesting.  I'm far from a Clynelish expert, but for me the waxiness is more mouthfeel and happens on the palate.  Did you ever have one of those wax candy bottles filled with juice/soda as a kid?  It's like that, but with Scotch inside. 
Hey, great review.  This sounds wonderful. I have yet to have a Clynelish I didn't like, though I did have a 7 year old, CS, Signatory that was a bit harsh, ah well.  Any briny notes? Love those maritime notes with Clynelish.  Did you try it with a little water? Just curious.
I was looking for it since this is my first Clynelish, but nothing really jumped out at me. And no, I'm not sure what candy you're talking about. I was always all about chocolate haha, never went in much for the fruity or sour candy.

It had a real lively funk and tartness that could possibly be picked up as brine. It does kind of taste like it could use a little water, but when I did it just got kind of boring. I only add 1/2 tsp of water at a time, so I don't think I added too much. Might experiment more with that. Thanks for reading!

I agree. Weird stuff and then the wax would get stuck on your teeth. Weird stuff.

"Review #57, Four Roses OBSF, Hi-Time Wine",,https://i.redd.it/zh9wmdre14821.jpg,"**Four Roses private select, OBSF, HiTime Wine Cellars, 9yr 5mo, 55.1%**

**Nose:** A smooth, soft nose. Brown sugar and chocolate, strawberry, lots of musty wood, mint, baked bread, candy corn

**Taste:** A little sharper and brighter than the nose, but still maintains a beautifully soft and well-rounded mouthfeel. A zing of sweet corn and cherry syrup, settles into softer orange zest, warm fruitiness, caramel, roasted marshmallow, and that perfectly toasted oak
 
**Finish:** Brash and complex finish that leaves charred and sweet. Chocolatey charred oak, black cherry, mint

*****

A delicious private select, and a really fun one too. Kind of soft and well balanced for a Four Roses, while still maintaining lots of delicious flavor and complexity. The huge toasted oak and cherry syrup I always get from these takes a bit of a back seat to more warm and fruity flavors, but there's still just the right amount of brash Bourbon goodness and oak that I love in these. 

What I wonder about is how they pick these, because I've noticed these are usually waaaay better after being open for a few months. I definitely like this one a whole lot more than when I first opened it, and I'm not sure if people picking can account for that.

I'm interested in your comment about how they pick these, and not being able to account for them opening up over time. I have and OESF and it was like mint and grass clippings the first pour. A month later I like it a lot more. Maybe my palate just can't pick out flavors like a pro. I mean, certainly it can't, but I wish it could :)  I'll just keep trying. 
Thanks for the review! I love hi-time and have had a store pick in the past. Good stuff. 

I wish they held more whiskey classes like they have wine classes.
Yeah that's what I wonder too. Can some people just tell how well a Bourbon will open up, or are our tastes different enough that they just like it more than I do when they first pick it? I think it ends up being a moot point(with Four Roses anyway) because they just always seem to end up delicious.
Just keep trying. You'll build margins of reference. What you're experiencing is oxidation once the bottle is open. In my experience, I can't remember the first pour ever being the best. Bottles open up for the better as you work your way through them and they get some air over days to weeks. Eventually, this tips the other way though and the nuance disappears into a generic cheap whiskey flavor. This takes quite a while though.
Thanks for reading. Yeah, their Whiskey picks always seem to be pretty solid. "
Literally was covered in dust,,https://i.redd.it/esjeqoapbg721.jpg,"Cool dusty, and for $60 I thought it was definitely worth checking out. Haven't seen much on Whisky Galore bottlings, but apparently they're put out by Duncan Taylor.

Full story [here](https://scotchwhisky.com/magazine/features/8384/the-true-story-behind-whisky-galore/), kind of interesting.
[removed]
Nice find!  I would have bought it too
I mean it could be worse, those are 3 good Scotches at least. But I could see how that would be aggravating.

>Something about that quite pale color.

Yeah, funny how that works. A bunch of producers artificially color their Scotch to make it darker, meanwhile I'm over here getting excited when I see that natural pale gold.
1992/1993 bottlings can have that super thick waxiness. I just found a dusty 13yr that was distilled in '93 and bottled in '07. Enjoy!
Nice, what kind of bottling is it? 
G&M. I actually tried this exact bottling in November when a friend brought over a bunch of Clynelish to try. This bottle won the night. It's 43% but that's the perfect proof. I took notes for all the drams but it's not just the flavor that worked, the mouthfeel was like a melted candle...so buttery and viscous. it made me understand why people go gaga over Brora. 
Cool, glad to hear you'll be enjoying yours then.

I'm really not that familiar with Clynelish, I had the standard 14yr years ago, don't remember being all that impressed with it and never revisited it. I just opened K&L's recent 10yr Signatory though and I'm diggin' it, it's my first real experience with the distillery and then I found this bottle. I also happened to get a sample of a 1978 Brora 35yr in the gift exchange, so everything's just coming up Clynelish right now!
If you enjoyed the 10yr K&L, I have a sneaking suspicion you're gonna love your recent dusty find. "
It's been a good month for Rye,,https://i.redd.it/clbhylis22621.jpg,"I see buddy you got that owl ;) addicted to now ? 
Nice call on the darkstar November. Have you tried their other beers from the stasis project? If you can try the paisley cave complex, it‚Äôs an imperial blueberry stout literally tastes like a blueberry muffin. Soooo goooood. 
Check out pike creek. A great rye for a pretty reasonable price. 
Hows the MWND? I've got a bottle but too nervous to open it up for some reason haha
I managed to resist buying it all this time because of the price, but then I tried some recently and holy shit is it good. Not enough BP Ryes out there there that aren't Bourbon-y. And since batch 2 was priced up and proofed down I don't think I'll be interested in future releases, so I figured I should just grab this.
I had the Red Eye November, it was seriously good. I got 2 more of those to age. I only grabbed one of these Rye stouts, I've never had one before so I didn't know if I would like it or not.

I could have grabbed a vanilla and a few others too, but I generally don't care for Stouts with a bunch of added flavorings. They get too sweet.
It's not just that it's delicious, it's very unique and interesting. Honestly I have to be in the mood for it, but when I am there is nothing like it. I recommend you just open it, it's made to be a winter Whiskey after all.
Well done buddy... tought the same :P
Just get everything. FO is an amazing beer. DSN and Ren are mid tier bottle logic. 
Well now I wish I had grabbed one. When the cashier saw me with the DSN she brought out like 3 or 4 more Bottle Logic beers that hadn't hit the shelves yet. I think they were all stouts with a similar label, but they all had different flavorings and additives. The FO just kind of blended in with those as a crazy added flavor beer that I wasn't interested in. I wasn't about to drop another $100 though just to try them all.
I‚Äôm more in the beer game then bourbon, I pay way over retail for my monthly allotment of bottle logic. Stick to the stouts, strong ales, and porters with them. 

Last night I drink a Respondent Angel which was a Barrel Aged Porter with cacao nibs added using Angel Envy barrels. 
Right on, that does sound good. Maybe I just haven't had enough good ones, but stouts I've had with vanilla, cacao, maple, fruit, etc just haven't appealed to me. They start to taste artificial and overly sweet to me. But I would definitely give that one a try, I've liked all their stuff so far. 

Whiskey is definitely my main game. I've always loved stouts and good beer in general, but I'm getting more into BA stuff the last year or so. One of my favorites so far has been Barrel Aged Old Rasputin, fantastic bottle.
Yeah. That is a pretty old school bottle. Bottle logic is a pastry stout brewery and don‚Äôt usually have barrel forward beer. Check out the bruery for things a big more barrel dominant.
I've had SHIT, I didn't care for it. But I didn't like BCBS either at first until I aged it for a year, whole different experience. A lot of BA stouts I've had have been too boozy, tannic, and overly sweet, but if they all age as well as the BCBS then maybe I'm just doing it wrong drinking them fresh. 
SHIT is a bad beer.  Nothing like Black Tuesday.

Got to try some Westvleteren over the holiday. I love Trappist Ale!,,https://i.redd.it/egbtnro1fb021.jpg,"A friend from Belgium shipped me some bottles, we drank the 8 and the 12 and threw in a St Bernardus Abt 12 for good measure. I'm not one to buy into hype at all, and honestly I was expecting to be underwhelmed and not find it *that* much better than readily available trappist ales. I was wrong, it's pretty amazing stuff. I definitely liked the 12 better than the 8, but it wasn't necessarily hands down better. My cousin actually preferred the 8, so it really boils down to personal preference. I've always loved the St Bernardus 12 which supposedly uses the same recipe and yeast, but honestly it can't hold a candle to the Westy. Cheers, hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving because I did!
Most do some sort of distribution just not Westvlettern which sorta adds to the allure. Orval is pretty solid. 
I like the 12 a lot. I usually do Rochefort 10 as my readily available Trappist quad 
My favorite beer of all time is the Westvleteren 8. It doesn't get much better than that. All of them are dynamite, though. 
I don't drink many dubbels but the 8 was insane. I have the 12 and the blonde but haven't tried them yet.
There's a lot of people saying the Westy XII tastes exactly like Abt 12. Those people have never tried a XII.

St Bernardus makes an amazing beer, but just the volume they produce makes it impossible to duplicate the Westvleteren XII. Btw, their past year Christmas Ale was excellent.


I'm not sure if I've had that one, but I'll definitely pick one up this weekend so thanks. I usually go for Tripels, but I dont think I've had a Trappist Ale I didnt love. I like Westmalle and Affligem a lot. Tripel Karmeliet isn't actually Trappist but it's one of my favorites.
> There's a lot of people saying the Westy XII tastes exactly like Abt 12. Those people have never tried a XII.

I can say with 100% certainty now that this is completely true. And yeah, I really enjoy their Christmas Ale
Make sure to get Straffe Hendrick quad too. And it's not that known, but I also liked the Urthel Samaranth, really good stuff.

Cheers, mate!
I'll have to try those, although it looks like the straffe is more readily available near me. Thanks for the suggestions."

The cup is lying unfortunately, I'm still not drinking anything. My 90 days isn't up until early January :(

I only managed to have a sip of this before I had to quit, I don't remember exactly how it was. I only recall it was good but I was a little underwhelmed, but it's always hard to tell from a first pour and I was hoping it would open up better. It's one of the ones I'm really looking forward to trying again to see how it's come along.

> I love stealing someone's glass just to nose the stuff

OK, question time: has *nosing only* changed your perceptions of the whiskies in question, either collectively or more notably in the case of a specific pour? I've always wondered what it would be like to go entirely on aroma alone, forsaking the palate & finish, but never had the self-discipline to try that as a extended experiment on myself.
Sounds like a good thing to me!
Thanks! It's nothing too serious, I've been fine for a while now but it's just a long regiment of an antifungal to make sure an issue with my foot is completely eradicated.

That's an interesting question, and I had kind of wondered the same. From just casually nosing a lot of Whisky I haven't noticed anything too drastically different tbh. Although I have noticed peat seems much more intense to me than it used to. I've poured some Laphroaig 10 and Triplewood, and both just seemed way more peaty and boggy and intense than I remember, it really made me want to take a sip. Almost like that first time I ever had peat, just so intense and strange and alluring. 

What I ought to do is pour something I've already reviewed, make some new notes on the nose, and then compare it to my review. I actually poured some OGD 114 just now since you got me thinking about it, just to roll the glass and nose it. But I haven't reviewed this one yet. "

Oof. I'm in California, so I'll take what I can get as far as a hands-on distillery tour goes. San Diego does have tons of great breweries though, she's doing some beer tastings too. I'm pretty jelly, but I can't drink right now anyway.
Bazinga!
Damn you BOOMED him!

True though. 
Is that the gin? She said their barrel rested gin and their rum were delicious. She said the whiskey was just okay, she liked the single malt better than the bourbon. 

A post of yours is actually what turned me onto the distillery in the first place, so thanks because she had fun.
Yep! Their gins are fantastic, and the white and aged rums are really good too. I agree with her about the whiskey - it's drinkable, but has heavy batch variance and is way too pricey for what you get. (Malahat next door is able to release a straight bourbon at roughly the same age and proof for like half the price. And it's better whiskey to boot.) 

The tour is awesome, though - they've got pretty large-scale facilities for a craft distiller and they'll let you see and even taste their fermenting bourbon mash. The barrel-aged spirits tasting at the end is $10, or free if you buy a bottle. (Hint: Buy the gin.)"

Kind of gimmicky, but I think it's cool and the couple of these that I picked up looked pretty interesting anyway. Especially this one, which is actually an unsherried Glenfarclas but is called ""Blairfindy"" because they don't let independent bottlers use the distillery name.

***** 

**1997 Blairfindy 16, Blackadder Raw Cask, Oak Hogshead, 54.1%**

**Nose:** Grassy malt, vanilla, briny funk, sweet cake frosting, berries and fruit. Sweet and fun

**Taste:** Thick, oily and sweet. Cake frosting, honey, some earthy and briny funk, sweet malt, vanilla, sugar cookie. The malty sweetness rides very steady and dense.

**Finish:** Honey and big grassy malt with some nice brininess and mouth numbing toasted wood. Rides out long and sweet.

*****

Sweet and malty throughout, this never hits a sour note. It's like dessert, and it's dense with flavor. The brininess and woody funk adds a really delicious and interesting element to this too. I kind of wish it ""popped"" a little more, it tastes a little reserved like it's just kinda missing something. A minor complaint though, it's really a delicious Whisky. Lots of fun to try some un-sherried Farclas too.

This is a tastee one at that. I think I had similar notes. 86/100?
They finally got back to me last week - ‚Äúwe bottle a lot of casks so it is hard to remember everything but if we haven't stated specifically on the label then it would have been either an ex-bourbon or an ex-refill (generally these are ex-bourbon but sometimes sherry).‚Äù
I‚Äôm on to you man! But I just haven‚Äôt quite figured it out yet....
Haha, that's why I like the 1-10 scale that I stole from t8ke, really simplifies it. I never really understood the 0-100 scale where 0-60 is never even used, but I'd say a 7 here is probably equal to a low/mid 80's score.
Yeah I missed a great opportunity to give it that score haha.
That's good to know, thanks for sharing. So unless it specifies sherry barrel it sounds like you can count on them being either first fill or refill bourbon barrel. I can see how this comes across as wine finished, but it just seemed real oaky to me, chocolatey rich.
R/dataisbeautiful post showed that majority of ratings on this sub is 86/100
Yeah, I guess it shows that there are quite a few very nice scotch‚Äôs out there. Some spectacular and some not so good.

*****

**1994 Bowmore 17, Blackadder Raw Cask, 50.7%**

**Color:** 1.4, I don't usually mention color but this is so dark

**Nose:** Creamy chocolate interwoven with smooth phenolic peat, dark berries, rich caramel, big dark vanilla, strong oak, more phenolic peat that gives way to minty evergreen

**Taste:** The smooth, laid back peat kind of takes a back seat to rich, chocolatey barrel notes. Creamy chocolate, sweet vanilla cream, thick caramel maltiness, clean and friendly phenolic peat, peppery clove

**Finish:** Brightens up with sweet berries, vanilla and peat, ends peppery and minty and peaty

*****

A humdinger for sure, but I'm actually not sure what to make of it. My very first impression on nosing it is that this is super rich and not your standard Islay. It comes across as having some kind rich, sweet wine finish. But once I dive in and start tasting it, I think it just has lots of big smooth barrel influence. It almost gets tannic and oaky but in the end it remains big, smooth, and chocolatey with lots of vanilla and friendly peat.

Interestingly enough I sent this out as a mystery sample to a few users, and they both guessed it was a wine finished peat bomb(one guessed a sherried or port finished peated bunna, and the other guessed Longrow Red Pinot Noir). And the nose really does make me think of some kind of rich wine finish other than sherry, but I don't think I get that once I dive in and taste it. I think it just has a lot of barrel influence

This sounds amazing. A real humdinger for certain and 87/100? That said, I‚Äôll look for this one.
Interesting bottle to be sure. I am surprised to see that poster btw, I developed a mild obsession with it since I saw it in a thrift store last week and it's amazing to see it this way.
I missed a golden opportunity not giving it this score!
This is already getting old now
Honestly for the price I paid, around $200, I don't think it was worth it. It was kind of an interesting Islay though, not your average briny and medicinal peat assault. Whether it's the age or barrel(wine?) influence, it has definitely been smoothed and softened out. Not really what I was looking for, but I could see it being more up someone else's alley. Thanks for reading!
That‚Äôs good to know. I‚Äôll take a pass on it then. My sweet spot on pricing seems to be the $70 - $120 range with going up to $170+- for something really nice. Sometimes a bit more, but not often...."

It's a mix of several different Bourbons from Indiana, Tennessee, and Kentucky, aged for 9 years and finished in Bourbon, Brandy, Amaro, and Cognac casks. This one really threw me through a loop, and I waste no time embarrassing myself.

*****

**Barrell Whiskey Batch 005, 9yr, 59.2%**

**Nose:** Wonderful malty Scotch! Sharp malty caramel, sweet vanilla, green apple, grassy hay, peppery, chocolate

**Taste:** Big sweet and malty blast, creamy butterscotch, grassy malt, floral zing, green apple, a sour twang that works nicely

**Finish:** Sweet malty caramel and tons of green apple

*****

* A straightforward Scotch. It's kind of a hot blast of sweet malt, water helps thicken it up and even it out a bit but it stays pretty bright and action-packed. I really like all the green apple and sour notes it has, keeps it kind of interesting. It tastes 55%+, and age is always difficult but I'll say 12-15 years.

**Post reveal thoughts:** Well shit, don't I feel silly. It's not even like I was weirded out or unsure, I never even questioned that this was a malty Scotch haha. That's what it immediately reminded me of and I went with it. It did taste very hot and lively for a malt bomb, but I just thought that it had a unique and funky character. What a jamboree of flavor.

Just finished a bottle of this one.  It is definitely way off the standard bourbon profile.  The only giveaway for me (granted I didn't taste this blind) was a a similarity to past Dickel barrel bourbon releases.  I believe that some similar barrels to those that were used in BB Batch 011 were also used in this one.  However, the finishing and other distillate incorporated in this blend  were enough to make it a pretty unique animal.  I can totally see someone guessing this to be a sweet malty barrel proof Scotch or even an Asian Malt.
Blind tasting is humbling.  And assumptions and suggestions can quickly derail our senses.
Well thanks for the encouraging words, I don't feel so bad now. It's definitely pretty unique. I don't usually mind drinking a whole sample and then moving on after the reveal, but this time I wish I could try more of it knowing what it is.
Exactly this. You can really get the full range too, because I've definitely had pretty good blind tastings that make me feel like some kind of badass connoisseur, but then sometimes you get ""humbled"" like you said haha.
Definitely!

Which is also why reading tasting notes before tasting yourself will almost always lead you to at least partially agreeing with the tasting notes.  We're too suggestive and the sensory inputs are too vague for most of us to easily disconnect from our other thoughts."

**Wild Turkey Longbranch, 43%**

**Nose:** Light caramel, orange, herbal spice, menthol, mild toasted oak

**Taste:** Pleasant, but it's kind of thin and one dimensional. Caramel, orange zest, slight peppery spice.

**Finish:** Falls flat, a pretty thin and typical caramel/brown sugar and cherry thing :/

* This is one of those Whiskies where the nose is the best part. It immediately reminded me of Four Roses or some kind of high Rye Bourbon, but the flat flavor quickly changed my mind. I'm not trying to talk shit though, it is tasty and doesn't have anything real off-putting, at a cheaper price it could be a solid sipper. It is some quintessential sweet bourbon. With some air especially it gets pretty nice. 45-50%

"Review #73, Laphroaig Triple Wood",,https://i.redd.it/2ekx5c4aq3n11.jpg,"This one is quite the experiment on Laphroaig's part, being matured in three different types of casks: Standard Bourbon barrels, quarter casks, then European sherry casks. Thus the ""Triple Wood"" name. 

*****

**Laphroaig Triple Wood, NCF, 48%**

**Nose:** Strong Laphroaig nose of medicinal and ashy peat, caramel, vanilla, sweet honey, some nice warm fruit, barrel char. The sherry influence is not immediately apparent to me, it's just strong Islay peat goodness that leans on the sweeter and fruitier side.

**Taste:** Darkly sweet with ashy char and smoldering peat, dark caramel richness. Brown sugar, fruity, lots of clean vanilla. The peat is there but it's dark and sweet and smoldering, not an in-your face peat assault. Again it doesn't scream ""sherried,"" to me, it's clean and peaty but with a darkly sweet edge to it.

**Finish:** Charred with sweet caramel and that dark, smoldering peat. Leaves ashy and charred and peaty with a wonderful fruity sweetness. A tad quick on the finish but still wonderful.

*****

Instead of getting a standard ""sherried peat"" expression that I've had plenty of times before(think IB Caol Ila), this drinks more like a unique and delicious Laphroaig Experience. It has all the peaty Islay/Laphroaig hallmarks I know and love, but flawlessly incorporates a wonderful sweetness. And it doesn't come across as a strong wine sweetness to me, there's no overwhelming sulphur or gritty sherry fruitiness. It's a clean, subtle sweetness and mild fruit that leaves the Laphroaig-y vanilla and medicinal/ashy peat completely in tact. It showcases the brand quite well, and bottling at 48% with no chill filtration was a perfect move on their part. Yummo

**Finish:**Finish gets sweet with vanilla and nice smoke that is very friendly and approachable, ends with a lightly ashy char

* It's kind of light and smooth for a peated Scotch but there's some wonderful flavor and complexity here. It's a nice mix of sweet smoke and richer chocolate and vanilla. The nose screams peat monster, but it ends up being a little more subtle and interesting than that. 43-46%, and I suck at guessing age but it doesn't taste young. I'll guess Longrow even though I've never had it, the rich chocolate reminds me of Springbank.

I think you nailed this one.  It's not my favorite Springbank by any means, and while good, I thought it was underwhelming for the price. 
I feel like Springbanks peat levels tend to be all over the place. The first time I tried the 10yo it was *very* smoky, and I had barely any of that in the 15, and you now you come out having it the other way round.
As I was reading through each step of your review, I was guessing a score better than just 'a cut above.'  There are a lot of good scotches in that price range, but you haven't noted a single off-note.  Perhaps the good component parts are not as intense as those in others?
Agreed, and these springbanks fetch a premium.
Interesting. Other than the 10 and 15 I've only had a couple of single barrels, and I've never got this much smoke from a springbank.
It just felt a little too thin and almost watered down. That's why I guessed 43-46% instead of a solid 46%+ I think. Its nitpicking though, it was delicious and scoring is always the hardest part for me anyway.
The 12CS I had was also very little smoke, so it can't be the additional age that the 15 has over the 10 (in my case, where I remember the 10yo to be quite smoky). One day I have to do a side by side just to check if my memory isn't cheating me.
I actually have samples of the 12cs, 15, and 18. I was planning on doing a sbs myself before I received this as a mystery sample. The 15 I have is a few years old at this point too so it would be interesting to see how it compares to this one like you said."
"Review #54, Smooth Ambler Old Scout Rye 7/99",,https://i.redd.it/jgxonf54opm11.jpg,"**Smooth Ambler Old Scout Rye, 7yr, 99 proof**

**Nose:** Dark and rich but with a nice Rye sweetness too. Sweet cherry, warm spiced Rye, darkly rich toasted wood, orange and chocolate, light dill, minty freshness

**Taste:** Rich, spicy Rye with lots of dark and toasted sweetness. Beautifully toasted oak, burnt caramel, maple, mint, mild dill, warm sweet cherry. Orange and grape fruitiness.

**Finish:** Rye spice and caramel lingers with tons of Rich chocolate and toasted wood

*****

I really like this bottle. It kind of walks a line between bright, happy spicy rye and dark, rich spicy rye. It's not just that it's delicious, it's so engaging and interesting. The Rye spice is strong, it's got a drinkable sweetness without getting syrupy, lots of richer toasted wood notes, it's just perfectly balanced and has anything I could possibly want in a Rye. The dill notes I see some people complaining about are there but meld with the herbal Rye notes and never feel as strong as other MGP I've had. If I have any complaints it would actually be how well balanced it is, as I often prefer a Rye that is more bright, spicy and in your face. I'm not complaining though, this one does it's own thing extremely well.

"Review #71, Single Cask Nation Laphroaig 5",,https://i.redd.it/4doscwl5zwl11.jpg,"This was drank as mystery sample #8 from u/Sezna

*****

**Laphroaig 5, Single Cask Nation, 2011/2016, refill Bourbon hogshead, 57.9%**

**Nose:** We have peat! Heavily peated, smooth and creamy. Clean peat, deep vanilla, barrel charred goodness, musty funk, a nice fun fruitiness and warmth.

**Taste:** The nose is very nice but it's kind of stable and controlled, the flavor explodes way more than I was expecting. Big fruity sweetness, creamy vanilla, darkly charred goodness, intensely heavy yet clean smoke. Some wildcard flavors of cinnamon and spice in there too. Peaty but with a complexity that flows effortlessly, very nice and very fun.

**Finish:** Delicious vanilla and smoke, root beer char and clean menthol. It's textbook peat finish as it should be imo.

*****

* This is a delicious dram. It's very well executed with huge, clean smokiness but with lots of other delicious and fun and fruity flavors. It reminds me of Port Charlotte, heavy peat but with a fun twist. I'd say it has some age on it though and not just some youngish NAS bottle. A delicious and smooth 46%.

**Post reveal thoughts:** Honestly I don't pay much attention to color, but even looking at the picture I took I don't see any of the sediment this apparently has. What surprises me most is the ABV. It's very smooth and drinkable, I almost guessed the ABV at 46-50% but decided it just wasn't strong enough and had to be a solid 46%. It tasted like a really awesome standard release to me. Good stuff. Bourbon barrel Laphroaig is the way to go IMO.

Ok man, the real question is any iodine? That‚Äôs the one taste with Laphroaig that I grapel with.  I was all in with ‚Äúdelicious vanilla and root beer char‚Äù you had me but any  iodine?
Yikes, this sounds amazing! Great review.
I'm not sure what you mean exactly by Iodine, I think of salt when you say that but I assume you mean that signature ""bandaidy"" medicinal flavor? I don't specifically remember since I actually drank it a few weeks ago, but I don't think it had that real ""Laphroaigy"" taste I know(and love), or I might have guessed that instead of Port Charlotte.
Yeah it was really good. I got everything wrong except for the fact that it was a smoky Islay haha, but these ones that mess with your expectations can be a lot of fun. Mystery samples are a hoot.
Medicinal, bandaids. That‚Äôs it. I think of iodide when I think of medicinal and bandaids.  It‚Äôs an odd taste. That said I‚Äôve been blending my own. A signatory Old Pulteney 8 year old with a Balblair 2003 - quite nice! 
You got the smoky Islay part right. Sounds like an incredible Laphroaig. 
That sounds delightful. IB Old Pulteney sounds real good. I've only ever seen a couple of Cadenheads and they have pretty mixed reviews around here.

I haven't really experimented too much with home blending myself, but I do have some infinity bottles going that are pretty good. I've got 4 of them: A bourbon, a Rye, a wine/malt and a peat bottle. 
Same here. But I thought I‚Äôd try the IB PULTENEY with the Balblair. It worked. This is an 8 year old Old Pulteney, Signatory, quite good. It‚Äôs got a new make butterscotch taste with a Pulteney base spirit taste. I might need any bottle. Sounds like you‚Äôve got a nice experiment going.
‚ÄúAnother‚Äù
You've got me curious to try some blends now actually. I've heard doing a blend with a very small amount of a peated scotch can be nice.

And btw, not sure if you saw them and I hate to plug my own reviews, but of the 8 mystery samples I received I'd say these were the most fun and interesting ones:

[Glenfiddich 15 distillery edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/9fdrve/review_70_glenfiddich_15_distillery_edition_51/), probably the best one too

[unknowingly comparing Laphroaig 10 and Ardbeg 10](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/98qptg/reviews_6768_ardbeg_10_vs_laphroaig_10_done_blind/)
I missed those somehow. That Glenfiddich sounds really good. Is it a distillery only bottling? If so, I hate myself as I was at the distillery in 2016, arrrg. Great reviews. Really liked the Ardbeg/ Laphroaig reviews, too.
I'm not sure, I cant find much on it. Everything just says ""limited edition."" It was for sale on master of malt at some point. It was so good, I wish glenfiddich did more quality stuff like this
Yea, I found the same. Looks like it was limited and not available now. Let's hope they release more CS like it. Sounds like it was like a single cask Arran or Ben Nevis? Something to look forward to. 

So as for blending, I haven't done too much of it. I've tried to add a little Talisker to some Clynelish that was ok but not great. So I thought I'd try to add some Balblair to that Signatory CS Old Pulteney. It was good. It added a bit more sweetness to the OP and toned down the ABV a bit. Now I'm thinking what that OP needs is some sherry, like maybe some glenfarclas?  Just havin fun. Cheers and have a good weekend."
"Review #14, Balcones Rumble (done blind)",,https://i.redd.it/0hnarepbwwl11.jpg,"This was drank as mystery sample #7 from u/Sezna. I don't think it's technically a Whisky, but this still seemed like the best place to post it. Here's a description of this unique spirit from Balcones: ""Crafted from fermented Texas wildflower honey, Mission figs and turbinado sugar, it is twice distilled in traditional copper pots then artfully matured in premium oak casks.""

*****

**Balcones Rumble, 47%**

**Nose:** Delicious! Sticky sweet caramel and fudge, butterscotch, deeply rich fruitiness like plums and dark cherry. Mint and spice on the tail end that morphs into a mentholy zing to the nose.

**Taste:** Oh wow it's spicy. Starts as kind of a light and sweet Whiskey, some caramel and warm citrus, and then it's cinnamon red hots right up front

**Finish:** The red hot cinnamon and spice just keeps building stronger. Never had such a cinnamony taste linger so long.

*****

* Not sure what to make of this one, pretty unique flavors. The cinnamon red hot isn't just a hint or flavor that pops up, it's the main attraction and it kind of puts me off. All the spice had me thinking some kind of flavored or barrel finished Rye like High West does, but the nose and initial smoothness is very Scotchy to me. The only Scotch I've had with this much cinnamon was a Kilchoman single barrel, but this doesn't seem to have any peat. Could also be some kind of weird experiment from an American distillery. I didn't like it at first, but after a decent amount of airing out the cinnamon spice was tamed a bit and I enjoyed it more. Still don't think I would buy a bottle though. As far as proof goes, I think it's 50%+.

**Post reveal thoughts:** I definitely started thinking craft whiskey or some weird experiment the more I drank it, since it was just so hard to nail down. It still drank like a whisky to me though, maybe its the barrel influence or just where my head was at. More like an aged mead I guess. It was good and I almost ranked it higher at 5, I just personally don't care for the heavy cinnamon spice flavor. An excellent mystery sample though!

Thanks for reading. Yeah I think I did another balcones review in r/Bourbon before and it worked out fine, probably should have just thrown this one in there too. It's not even a whiskey though so it felt weird 
It's American though, not sure where else it could go.  I've long been wondering what Rumble was like.  Good blind test.

*****

**Glenfiddich 15 Distillery Edition, NCF, 51%**

**Nose:** Sweet sherry, cake frosting, fun strawberry and tart berry fruitiness, orange, fresh pastry. Fantastic nose on this, so fun and sweet and yummy.

**Taste:** Definitely cask strength, it hits hard. I added a drop of water to smooth it out and enjoy the sweet sherry more. Water helps a lot here, it's dark and rich but still has that fun fruitiness. Dark fruit and strawberry, tart cherry, plum, rich spices, thick caramel. It's thick and builds beautifully.

**Finish:** Builds to huge, sweet and fruity finale. Super rich with nice gritty barrel char.

*****

* Really excellent stuff, I like this a lot. A good lesson too on how much just a drop of water can open up a dram, this just transformed beautifully with only a 1/2 tsp added. I keep mentioning sherry so I hope that's right. I think it's right around 55%, and I've never been good at guessing age but I'd say it has some years on it and isn't just some NAS. It tastes like lots of sherried drams I've had so I don't really have a guess. I want some though!

**Post reveal thoughts:** Never heard of a cask strength Glenfiddich before, how cool. 51% is usually so drinkable, this one packs a punch though. Wow, what a zinger.

This one is so good! Really an underestimated whisky.
Is this the standard 15 (i.e. Solera vatting), just at Cask Strength? If so, I'm very interested!!! 
I used to love this one. Wish I could still get it 
This sounds amazing and from a quick search, not readily available? Great review. That‚Äôs a bottle I‚Äôd like to find.
Yeah, I'm glad I got to try it blind because it really is phenomenal. It's kind of infuriating though, because a distillery as big as this must have enough stock to make stuff like this more often.
I haven't had the standard 15yr, but I don't imagine it's this heavily sherried. But it is fucking delicious and I recommend getting it if you see it. I don't think it will be an easy one to find though.
No this isn't the Solera, [here's some info](https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/scotch-whisky/single-malt-whisky/glenfiddich/15-year-old-distillery-edition-whisky/)
I believe it is travel retail only.

*****

**Ardbeg 12, That Boutique-y Whisky Company, 52%**

**Nose:** Intense and briny peat, citrus,sweet grassy malt, butterscotch

**Taste:** Sweet malt, smoke is clean and light and not as intense as on the nose. Sweet vanilla, butterscotch

**Finish:** Super sweet on the finish, thick caramel and brown sugar

* It's a delicious Islay I'll wager, it's pretty sweet and malty though and with a real nice peatiness. Lovely dram, I'm thinking IB Laphroaig since the peat can be surprisingly clean and sweet with these sometimes. Bourbon barrel, low 50's ABV.

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** I was pretty sure it was an IB Islay, but I was arguing with myself whether I should guess Caol Ila or Laphroaig. Ardbeg never even entered into my thought process, since I don't think I've ever seen one before. It was as tasty as I could have hoped something like this could be.

When you say ""boutique-y"" it makes me think flowery like gin. But that doesn't make sense. Could you please explain that term for me?

Also thank you for the review. If I see this I'll pick it up.
This was a great dram, finished mine off last night, i also said 7/10, although didn't do a formal review.  Thanks /u/nsquare14

I dont think i'd pay the retail for the small bottle, but solid stuff.  I need more IB ardbeg in my life

Nice review.  Do you find it interesting that despite tasting this whisky blind, bias still entered into the thought process? i.e. when you decided it was an IB, you (consciously or unconsciously)  eliminated Ardbeg as an option. 
Glad you liked it. Gonna kill this bottle soon. One last dram remaining. 
You might be thinking of the word ""bouquet"" which is an arrangement of flowers or a flowery smell. ""Boutique"" is like a really fancy and upscale store, so they're basically calling themselves ""that super fancy whisky company,"" a little tongue-in-cheek humor I think.

It is really good, but it's probably not something you will find on shelves. Good luck though!
thanks for reading. Yeah this was super tasty but these boutique-y bottles aint cheap that's for sure. 
Yeah, I totally get what you're saying. Once you have a certain amount of knowledge about how this industry works, it's hard to be completely blind to a tasting. Color too, just seeing the color can start to influence before you even start to taste it.

**Green Spot Single Pot Still Irish Whiskey, 40%**

**Nose:** A lightly sherried malt I think, dry and fruity. Light strawberry and plum fruitiness, smooth caramel and malt, apple, very light spice

**Taste:** Kind of watered down. Honey and caramel, smooth pastry malt, sweet fruitiness. Just kind of lightly and sweetly moves along, not a big production but pleasant enough.

**Finish:** Honey, vanilla icing, light fruit. Short and sweet.

* Nothing amazing here, but it's very pleasant and enjoyable. If it is a sherried Scotch it's a very light influence, but I could also see this being just a super sweet malt, I kind of remember AnCnoc being like that. I think this is probably only 40-43% though. A japanese malt wouldn't surprise me either. The sweetness and very light fruitiness works very well for me, and I would definitely consider taking this to a party for non Scotch drinkers to enjoy.

Agreed. The Chateau Leoville Barton version of GS is 46% and NCF, that definitely kicks it up a notch to my taste.

Nice review, cheers!
Thanks! Also I found out about yellow spot, which is apparently very similar but with a 12yr age statement and bottled at 46%. But I'm not into paying almost $100 for stats that should be pretty standard anyway imo
> I'm not into paying almost $100 for stats that should be pretty standard anyway imo

Yes, I can understand that. I'm willing to shell out a bit more (i.e. more than I really should based on specs) to have 1 really nice bottle of Irish whiskey on hand at all times - for me it fills a different niche from scotch, something I can drink when I'm not in a mood to analyze and intellectualize over the dram, but instead just want something fruity, friendly and fun that tastes really good and makes me happy."

**Mystery #3**

**Nose:** Islay nose for sure. Briny and boggy phenolic peat, vanilla, ashy char, rubber, sweet cream, chocolate, more toasted char

**Taste:** Sweet vanilla frosting and chocolate, builds back up to big Islay peat, ashy charred goodness, briny sea and creamy sweetness.

**Finish:** Big finish, creamy sweet vanilla and big charred peat, delicious.

* This doesn't seem bandaid-y enough to me to be Laphroaig and it's heavy on the sweetness and brine, which is more how I remember Ardbeg 10 being. So I'm gonna go with that. Delicious stuff.

Score: **7**

*****

**Mystery #4**

**Nose:** Smells like more Islay, or peat anyway. It's big peat but warm and friendly with a phenolic quality. Caramel and malt, chocolate, lots of crisp menthol, clean brine

**Taste:** It's smooth and friendly peat, not a peat assault at all. Sweet caramel and earthy peat, warm friendly malt, light vanilla, menthol. It's soft and watered down tasting, I thought it was kind of boring at first but I think I'm just conditioned to Islay peat, the more I drink this the more I like it.

**Finish:** Malty caramel and warm, soft peat. Gets darker and more charred on the finish which is nice

* It's heavily peated for sure, but maintains a soft and friendly character compared to most Islays. Tastes like it's probably around 43%. I don't think it's Islay, I wanna guess maybe a peated Japanese Whisky? They tend to be lower ABV and quite smooth too which would fit here. It's been a long time since I've had Talisker though, I kind of want to guess that too.

Oh no! Laphroaig 10 was my first Scotch love, and it's still one of my favorites. I have 3 unopened bottles that I got at a really good price, just there to grab on my way out to a party or a camping trip. I feel like my life is a lie, I rated Ardbeg 10 higher! :O

Even knowing it's Laphroaig 10, it doesn't ""click"" for me. I got some phenolic notes in the nose, but it just didn't have all the bandaid I remember from Laphroaig 10 at all.I looked up my review done NOT blind, and honestly I don't really describe it as a ""peat assault"" there either. Maybe the idea of Laphroaig 10 is bigger in my mind than the actual flavor. I even commented in the post that I would have given it a 6 or 7 on the 1-10 scale. I'm glad I got to try tyhis blind, It's good to have our expectations shattered a little sometimes. I have always loved Ardbeg 10 as well, I think I just have more of an emotional connection with Laphroaig since it was my first fine Scotch love. So this was fun.

A sample of The Corryvreckan was my first Islay malt and boy did it kick me up the arse, as I was only used to Irish whiskey and a highland/speyside Scotch whisky. The only peat I had ever tried was that of a HP 12yo which is very mild in comparison. 

Even though I didn't like it to begin with I kept coming back to it, to the point of constantly thinking about it. As soon as I finished the Sample I bought the Ardbeg 10yo and that was it I was hooked, I've been an Ardbeg fan ever since. 

Now I have the An Oa, 10yo and the Uigeadail. I'm getting the Corryvreckan for my Birthday and probably the Grooves for Christmas. 

I have yet to try the Laphroaig but I will as I have heard many great things.
I'm with you on the Laphroaig. My first antiseptic-soaked love years and years ago -- now it's too sweet and watery for my taste. Not sure how much of the change is me, the whisky, or both.
Recently had a ""smoky scotch"" tasting and after Ardbegs, Ledaigs and Longrows the last dram was Frog10. It's clearly more stinky, rubbery, phenolic than any of them. I never felt that way when finishing up a bottle, but side-by-side it was super apparent.
Great review. Very interesting with the blind element and the outcome.
To me, Laphroaig 10 is like Nirvana and Ardbeg 10 is like Soundgarden.  Both have a full sound and great songs, but Soundgarden's arrangements can be more complex.
Your life is not a lie; you've just glimpsed the truth.

Frog 10 is a great intro to Islays/peat, but to me Ardbeg 10 is the superior, more interesting dram.
> I have 3 unopened bottles that I got at a really good price

What's a good price for Laphroaig 10 in the US?
I've had all of those Ardbeg varieties save the Corryvreckan. Looking forward to see what you think. I'm working on Grooves right now, but different from their others but very good. I definitely gained a deeper appreciation for scotch after visiting some distilleries in Scotland. 100% worth the trip if you've never been. 
I‚Äôm exactly the same as this. A friend brought a bottle for us to share as he‚Äôd been to the distillery on a tour in the late noughties, and it blew my mind. 

I recently finished another bottle of Laphroaig 10 and spent some time sampling it against the Ardbeg 10, and I‚Äôm somewhat sad to say I prefer the Ardbeg. The Laphroaig is bottled at 40% here which shows compared to the ~47% Ardbeg. 
That's kind of where I'm at with it right now after this blind tasting. I will say that Sezna got back to me that the sample was from the tail end of the bottle, but I still feel like I should have been in the ballpark with it. I didn't even think it was an islay. Tempted to crack one of my bottles now to see how it compares.
Great analysis
Objectively speaking, I think you might be right. But also, you shut your mouth!
I never get tired of reading Ardbeg 10 reviews. It's the greatest $40 whisky there is.
Found them for $30 USD, bought 2 or 3. 
I've never been but I would to take the wife and kids there, only problem is we both love scotch so much we may never come home lol

From what I remember of the Sample of Corryvreckan, it was 3 years ago so my memory is a little sketchy, is the absolute intensity of the spice and peat. Even though it is similar in ABV to the Uigeadail it is so much more rich and intense. It had the longest finish of any whisky I've ever tasted. A large portion of the whisky is made from European oak which is notoriously spicy. If you love Ardbeg then you need to at least try the Corryvreckan.
Hey, great reviews. I really like Ardbeg 10 and for that matter just about everything Ardbeg puts out. Wasn‚Äôt really fond of Corryvreckan though. As for the Laphroaig, I wondered if it wasn‚Äôt the tail end of a bottle. Both are winners and at $30 a bottle, what a steal.
Great deal, definitely jealous.
I look at it like this, at that price, most definitely stock up, I'd always keep a bottle of the frog around at that price even though its not my fav.
You're right, when I asked him it turns out it was the tail end of the laphroaig bottle. Still pretty surprising results to me.
That was a freak deal, never seen it before or since. I usually get it for around $40.
It‚Äôs interesting how whisky changes over time. I think we‚Äôd all agree, it‚Äôs cool stuff!"
"Review #12, mystery sample",,https://i.redd.it/f5tdiwgke6h11.jpg,"Mystery sample #2 from u/Sezna

**Nose:** Hey now, this smells goooood. Winey and malty, a beautiful combo. It's lightly fruity and chocolaty, melds beautifully with a rich, robust maltiness and sweet, sticky caramel. There's some tart berry in there too keeping it interesting.

**Taste:** Comes alive on the palate. Sweet and fun fruitiness explodes on the tongue, rich caramel, butterscotch, tons of creamy chocolate. It tastes less and less like a Scotch the more I drink it, but I'm not sure what it tastes like lol. Whatever it is I like it. It has lots of fruity and sweet flavor but without being overly sickly-sweet, it maintains a creamy and chocolatey richness.

**Finish:** The fun, sweet fruit peaks and then settles down, leaves rich and sweetly creamy with chocolate and caramel and malt. Oh yeah.

Wow, this was different. The nose is quite Scotchy but the flavor almost comes across as a rum to me. But it's a little too smooth and well-aged and has a creamy thickness that I've only ever gotten from Scotch before. And so much chocolate, just delicious. My mom always taught me to go with my first instinct, and the first nosing told me this was a wine aged malt. Don't think it's sherry though, and I don't think it has the punch of something bottled higher than 46%. So I'll say Glenmorangie 12yr Quinta Ruban, port finished? This is a little better than I remember that being though.

Nikka Coffey Malt, 45%

A pretty surprising reveal on this one. I really thought I had it pegged as a wine finish, there was so much sweet chocolatey port(or so I thought). Definitely curious to try this again.

Score: **8**, for sheer decadent enjoyment that appeals to my sweet tooth.

"Review #66, mystery sample",,https://i.redd.it/26zgpkzrc6h11.jpg,"Mystery sample #1 from u/Sezna

**Nose:** This smells immediately familiar to me, but it could just be that kind of Scotch. Bold rich caramel malt, vanilla, banana funk, musty wood, slightly tannic, a nice hint of floral perfume in the backgrond that doesn't overpower the meaty and malty profile

**Taste:** Smooth caramel, Bourbon barrel goodness. Warm and sweet vanilla cake, caramel maltiness, light chocolate, slight pepper spice. It has a rich and smooth character that sludges along, it's tasty but not complex or in a big hurry to throw flavors at you. But the thick caramel and maltiness is nice

**Finish:** Smooth chocolate and rich caramel, continues lazily but thickly along with a nice little fruity kick

This reminds me a lot of The Balvenie 12 SiB, but it somehow tastes older than 12 years to me. It tastes like it managed to pick up a lot of the rich Bourbon barrel flavors but without being too woody at all. 46-48%. So Balvenie 15 Single Bourbon Barrel?

That sounds really good. Have you had other Arrans?
Nice review.  My bottle is almost gone. It's a very sold entry level OB in my opinion, and the price is right.
Ive had a couple sherried ones that were real good, the 12yr cask strength and a 15yr SiB. Arran seems to take to sherry very nicely.
Agreed. It really takes sherry well but that 10 sounds really good.Ok then, on the lookout for more Arran.
Their SiB's are always cool, give a lot of info on the label about exact age/dates and barrel info.
A dense moment here, ""SiB's"" ?, single bottles?  
Sorry, it's not any kind of officially recognized term but a lot of people around here use it as an acronym for ""Single Barrel."" Might be more of a Bourbon thing though.
Got it, seems pretty clear now, thanks. I have a nice 15 year old, SiB (quick study, haha,) Arran, Binny‚Äôs https://www.binnys.com/arran-distillers-15-year-old-sherry-cask-2000-296-binnys-handpicked-938189.html?binnysStore=8. I will definitely keep a look out for more. 
I'm so jealous of all your excellent bottles haha. It makes me think of all the awesome bottles of scotch I could have if I wasn't also so obsessed with American Whiskey. It's a constant balancing act trying to support both sides of the habit. I'm always jealous of people who only like one or the other with Scotch and Bourbon.
I see it as a curse ;). I‚Äôve tried bourbon but just can‚Äôt warm up to it so I just keep focusing / obsessing with scotch.  I intend to keep trying American whiskey though. I just picked up a Signatory bottle of a 9 year old, sherry cask aged Glenlivet. It becomes the hunt, we all have it whether it‚Äôs bourbon or scotch. I‚Äôll toss it in the back of my closet and eventually get around to it but only after the next find....Saw a Blackadder bottling of Arran that looks üëç, see what I mean. Cheers!
Yeah I hear you, it doesn't really matter what you're into you are gonna spend too much money and time pursuing it haha. 

I had a sherried signatory glenlivet 9, 2006. It was really good but somehow had very little sherry infl ui en e and tasted like a malt bomb https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/77azct/review_30_signatory_glenlivet_9/
Nice review on the GL9. I‚Äôm looking forward to trying mine and seeing how much sherry influence it has."
"Review #64/65, Laphroaig 10yr Cask Strength, batch 007 vs 009",,https://i.redd.it/m5a5u9levng11.jpg,"**Laphroaig 10yr Cask Strength batch 007, 56.3%**

**Nose:**¬†Uber-Laphroaig peatiness that is intensely phenolic and bandaid-y, with a smooth, warm backbone of sweet caramel and vanilla. Iodine, ocean bogginess, leather, seaweed, beautiful ashy root beer char.

**Taste:**¬†Gritty caramel, barrel char, huge vanilla, builds slowly and steadily to the huge Laphroaigy peat. Sweet grass and lemon, seaweed, earthy char. Everything about this is huge and hits like a sledgehammer, yet still manages to be complex and well balanced.

**Finish:**¬†That wonderful phenolic peat just coats the mouth and lingers for the longest time, ends sweet and charred and phenolic, leaving the mouth numb and wanting more.

*****

**Laphroaig 10yr Cask Strength batch 009, 58.1%**

**Nose:** Boggy, phenolic peat hits strong but it's smoothed out a little, the sweetness and vanilla is upfront and integrates nicely with the huge peat. Caramel, sweet vanilla, lemon, rubber, boggy and salty seaweed, tart berry, toasted wood and ashy char

**Taste:**¬†Sweet, sweet peat, compared to the 007 it tastes a little more lighter and easy sipping. Lemon and fruity sweetness, vanilla, salty caramel, huge warm and friendly phenolic peat with burnt rubber

**Finish:** The peat carries through spectacularly to the finish and builds to it's highest levels. Briny, phenolic peat, sweet berry and vanilla, light char.

*****

These are both amazing, and the differences are much more pronounced than I was expecting. The 007 is what I have always known the 10yr CS to be, which is everything I love about Laphroaig dialed up to 11. The textbook phenolic Froggy peat is so amazingly huge, but it delivers with a wonderful warmth and charred goodness that is just about perfect. The 009 is still hugely peaty and delicious, but everything is just a little more smooth and balanced, and it leans on the sweeter side. For me personally ""*balance*"" and ""*sweet, well integrated peat*"" are not necessarily what I am looking for in a Laphroaig. So I definitely prefer the 007, but I could see someone who is maybe not such a Frog fanboy preferring the sweet complexity of the 009 over the vanilla-bandaid-peat hammer of the 007. I should say the 009 drinks much better and stronger on it's own and not side by side with the 007. Both are powerful and worthy Laphroaigs.

Score:

Batch 007:¬†**8.5**

Batch 009:¬†**8**

Recently picked up a 6. Store has two other batches on the shelf: 7 and 9. I actually have stood there debating which to get next. Your review was like a gift. Also a curse....because now I know I need to buy both! 
I just finished my 7 last weekend, this is great thanks! I still need to see what is available but at least it is good to know the 9 is a solid choice.
Where do you see the batch number on the bottles? I see a few shops near me have this and it sounds like a must try. As always a huge thanks to everyone that posts all these reviews, even though it is turning into an alchy
Oh man, they both sound good. Is the 9 the most current?
I'd go with the 007 if I were you, I liked it better and its older so it wont be as easy to find in the future.
Can't miss it, right on the front under the red stripe.

EDIT: It's actually under the red stripe on the tube, but over the red stripe on the bottle. 
I think I've seen reviews for batch 10 that aren't as favorable. Some people say these are going downhill, so I was happy that the 009 at least was as good as it was.
I have 9 and SBS it with the 10. Those two are not much different. 
Good to know. I hope the quality isn't sliding but seems to be a trend with some it seems. The Laphroaig CS is such a great value. That would be a good discussion, what are your all around solid, great value, whiskies. Cheers, time for a dram.
Fwiw I thought b9 was going downhill
Good to know, gives me some hope even though I'd rather have the 007
Thanks, good to hear. The Laphroaig, CS is just a great, amazingly affordable, whisky, IMHO.
I'm at my local small town brewery myself enjoying a Friday beer, but I'm a few hours behind you. Cheers buddy!
I can see how some people might feel that. My first impression(especially while drinking it sbs with the 007) was that the 009 was a lighter, smoother, more easy sipping version of the 007. And that's kind of true, but when drinking it on it's own you realize it's still a beast of a Scotch and has it's own merits. Just struck me as a slightly different style, but I definitely do enjoy the Laphroaig-assault of the 007 more.
Oh man, that sounds nice. Cheers!
I missed that rich bacony goodness, that was the calling card of the 10 CS to me, when it came to batch 9."

**Nose:** Sweet and minty. Crisp mint and evergreen, thick brown sugar sweetness, tons of vanilla, toasted marshmallow, clove and other seasonal baking spices, toasted wood. Quintessential spicy and sweet Rye goodness, my god.

**Taste:** Instantly explodes with a minty and rye spice bang, bright cinnamon and caramel, cherry sweetness, gritty toasted wood

**Finish:** Long, beautiful sweet rye finish. It's bright and sweet and fiercely spicey and just so pleasant

*****

**WhistlePig 10yr Single Barrel, Stagecoach Liquors store pick, 60.15%**

**Nose:** Brown sugar and chocolate sweetness that is thick and rich. Molasses, vanilla, caramel, rich oak. Mint, menthol and cinnamon pleasantly mixing in with the richer flavors, adds a nice spice kick that lets you know you're definitely drinking a goddamn Rye.

**Taste:** Thickly sweet brown sugar and caramel with a big fruity punch, heavy cinnamon, fudgy chocolate, dark toasted wood. The mellow, menthol-y Rye spice livens up the darker and richer flavors beautifully. Again you definitely know you are drinking a goddamn Rye

**Finish:** The huge Rye spice finally comes through more on the finish, but it remains rich and darkly sweet. Rich caramel and chocolate that builds to a very nice rye spice and dill.

*****

2 different beasts, both delicious. The Bevmo is about as close to a perfect Rye Whiskey as I've had. It's bright and spicy and sweet but with all the delicious richness and perfectly toasted wood that age brings. It's sweet, spicy, and action-packed, and is just so fiercely *Rye* in every way. The Stagecoach is a beautifully thick and luscious Whiskey with a wonderful Rye spice backbone. I like the Bevmo pick better but I could totally see someone with different tastes preferring the Stagecoach bottle. Once again WhistlePig SiB's fail to disappoint, it's some of my favorite Whiskey around.

I saw those at bevmo. I was a lite leery about a store pick as the history with them for me has not been received well.  Headed out when they open to get a bottle.  
Thanks for the review! I just recently received a bottle of WP 10yo for my birthday and I was blown away (coming for a regular Bulleit Rye drinker). I am now making it my personal goal to try as many WP varieties as possible, I'll be on the lookout for these. 

Have you tried the WP Farmstock?
Be aware that Bevmo has had several WhistlePig picks, the one at your store might be different than this one. And don't forget your $10 off coupon! 
What barrel number was yours?
Update...  

Apparently my store was either out or not sure of what the hell I was asking.  Soooo... I grabbed my go to, Russell's 10 year.  For me, it just seems to really hit it.  I will be on the lookout next payday. 
The bottle doesn't give any barrel number or info, you would have to go by the proof.
Dang. Guess that goes to show how many bottles of WhistlePig I've bought. My BevMo didn't have any anyway. Out of curiosity, did you happen to notice if yours had Maker's Private Selects and if so, how much they were? It seems like mine has been hiking prices on bottles like crazy lately.

**Taste:** Caramel malt and chocolate, the sherry is there but much more darker than it was on the nose. Definitely needed some water for me, and it opens up dark and sweet and complex. Sweet grape drink and strawberry, ashy char, brine, earthy richness, chocolate.

**Finish:** Long and lingering finish that is dark and charred, lots of earthy sweetness and rich caramel maltiness.

*****

This is an interesting one. The nose screams ""sweet and fun"" sherry goodness, but then the experience is more chocolatey rich and charred. It's sweet in a smooth, rich and earthy way, and remains malty and thick throughout which is totally how I like my sherry. It's a pretty amazing scotch, makes me realize how bad I am at picking sherried malts.

Please forgive my ignorance, but what is up with the handwritten lables on these bottles? 
Okay, that makes sense. Thanks!
Nice review. Glad you liked it. Pretty amazing stuff.
No problem! A lot of us on here send these samples to each other in the mail, we just trade different whiskies from our own collections. There used to be a subreddit dedicated to it, but it got banned so we migrated to a new site: https://speak-easy.club

Wow!  Very nice..  Get them allllll.
Awesome! Are you able to see a date code on the bottle or label?

What's funny is that most stuff in this store was pretty overpriced. I saw the older Austin Nichols bottle out of the corner of my eye, and I immediately scoffed thinking they were charging some premium for a ""dusty"" bottle. I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually in a bargain bin. I took this picture, then scooped it up along with the 19yr Scotch I was buying. Kind of a funny pairing. 
It was just the one bottle, unless you're referring to the spiced wild turkey. They did have a bunch of older Black Bottle Scotch in the islay-style bottle, I was pretty curious about that stuff but didn't grab any.
Agreed clean them out for that price
I only gave it a quick glance and didn't see anything. I'm visiting family so I haven't got it home yet to give it a proper look
I've had Black Bottle 10 Year Old which was from the early 2000s and it wasn't very good at all. The more recent Black Bottle that I tried was surprisingly much better, not too bad for an inexpensive blend so unless you try beforehand I'd say stick with the current juice if its same price or less.
I'm not like a huge fan of the newer one or anything, I got a bottle years ago and thought it was decent bottle for the price. I heard the older version was better is all, more smoky like."

**Nikka Whisky from the Barrel, 51.4%**

**Nose:** Caramel, toffee, thick vanilla. It's dark and earthy and rich but in a light, easygoing way. Sweet tart berries, graham cracker, some chocolate and woody char.

**Taste:** Smooth chocolate and earthy caramel, ashy and toasted wood, bitter tannins, cinnamon. Not much of the sweetness the nose had, it's earthy and dark and smooth.

**Finish:** Earthy and charred and chocolatey, but with more pleasant sweet fruitiness and caramel popping up.

*****

This isn't like other Japanese Whisky I've had that tends to be fruitier and sweeter(basically just Yamazaki and Hibiki). It's quite dark and woody. I actually didn't enjoy it very much at first, it tasted kind of closed and hot, thought it was a dud. But it seems like Cask Strength Japanese Whisky is a pretty rare thing, so I really didn't want to water it down, and as it turns out it just took a long time to open up. Once it did though it got creamy and smooth and chocolatey, not to mention darn drinkable which is how I'm used to Japanese Whisky being.

**Taste:** Yep, it's a really sweet one but definitely has much more going on than that. Honey and sweet butterscotch, creamy wheat, delicious brown sugar, sharp green apple and a cinnamon burn, lightly toasted wood.

**Finish:** The easygoing creamy sweetness basically holds, but darkens a little into gritty caramel, spicy cinnamon, and toasted wood. Not a real long or powerful finish, but super tasty.

As someone who is a big fan of WHEATERS, this is delicious and a dream come true. It's sweet and creamy and pleasant, everything I look for in one of these. It's as full-flavored yet easy-drinking as you could hope for at the price, and perfect at the proof. The only other OWA SiB I've had was good and all, but much oakier and a little more thin and tannic. That pick was good, and kind of interesting as a different approach to the 107, but not really anything that special to me. This on the other hand is WHEATER heaven, and for me at least an example of why people probably go crazy for this stuff.

**Laphroaig Cairdeas 2013 Portwood, 51.3%**

**Nose:** Bit of a muted nose. Caramel and thick strawberry fruit, dark chocolate, vanilla, the peat is very subdued and brooding. Rich wood(like wood furniture) and char.

**Taste:** Gritty dark chocolate and toasted wood, dark and rich fruit like strawberry and plum, thick and sludgy peat, you can almost chew on this. It's creamy and thick but velvety soft at the same time.

**Finish:** Continues dark and mysterious, with darkly-dark chocolate, darkly warm fruit sweetness, and sneaky peat

*****

This is my second time trying this and my opinion hasn't changed much. It's an excellent Scotch and very well crafted, but it's something I would have to be in the mood for and just not really up my alley. It's smooth and mysterious and brooding, sludgy and chocolatey. But it just tastes kind of muted and boring to me, and a little too ""porty."" I feel the same way about other Ported Whiskies such as Benriach Solstice and MWND, so maybe Port finished stuff just isn't always for me. I don't mean to make it sound like I didn't enjoy this though, it's still a delicious pour. But the 2015 remains my favorite Cairdeas. I guess I just prefer more of an assault on the senses and a straight-forward Bourbon barrel Laphroaig.

After receiving a sample of this from him in a swap, I got some pretty off notes that tasted kind of weird. I had just gotten over a cold and probably shouldn't have done a proper tasting yet, but regardless he still offered to send another sample along for free along with some extras to boot. Thank you much sir, I'll have you know it didn't go to waste this time!

This Cairdeas was aged in a combination of bourbon barrels and Amontillado hogsheads, which is a type of sherry.

*****

**Laphroaig Cairdeas 2014 Amontillado, 51.4%**

**Nose:** Malty caramel, heavy medicinal peat that is rock solid and clean, ocean brine, smooth chocolatey wood, some light friendly char. The wine finish is not strong or readily apparent to me, maybe just a nuttiness and sweet funk.

**Taste:** It has a smooth, rounded, and sweet mouthfeel, not an Islay smack to the face at all. Smooth chocolate and caramel malt with clean medicinal peat, light root beer char, earthy sweetness, honey, grape fruitiness, menthol

**Finish:** Clean, shimmering caramel and smooth chocolate, honey, leaves with light phenolic peat and ashy char.

*****

An interesting Laphroaig. Unlike the other two wine finished Cairdeas' (2013 Portwood and 2016 Madeira), this is not a heavy handed wine influence at all. The sherry is smoothly and sweetly integrated and the Laphroaig medicinal peat is tempered nicely. I would probably have bought a bottle of this if I had tried it when it was available, in contrast to the last 2 Cairdeas' which I actually kind of regretted buying full bottles of.

So far I have not been enjoying this bottle, and I planned on doing this review to slam the stuff, but this is actually a pretty good pour. It's over a year old and at the bottom of the bottle, so maybe the oxidation and age finally changed it for the better. Or maybe reviewing it just helped me appreciate it more(happens to me a lot). It's a bright, happy kind of Bourbon that's sweet and spicy with nice toasted oak that isn't overwhelming. And it does all this in a big way at that proof. I always hear a lot about the Jim Beam ""peanut funk"" in these, but I can't say I really picked up anything that specific. Maybe it's the earthy funk I was picking up.

I like your heavy pour. You‚Äôd make for a good friend.
I like Booker‚Äôs, but considering my local store has 14yr old single barrel Knob Creek for $40, it‚Äôs hard to drop $70 on this. 
>have not been enjoying
Wait, I‚Äôm confused‚Ä¶ *have* been enjoying?
I like everything about this drop except for 1 thing - I find it burns on the way down. Drinking it on the rocks helps with this, but it obviously dilutes the flavour. 
I don't know why but proof seems to hide the Beam peanut character.  Luckily.  If Booker's had the peanut of the basic Beam bourbons and ryes, I'd never touch it.  
This has been my least favorite Booker's batch thus far - the flavors just seem to lack any richness and depth, despite having a lot of punch due to the proof. Some of my favorite batches I'd rate a 7, maybe even 8 on your scale, I'd put this one about at a 4 or 5.
I always pour heavy for reviews, I like to really dive in. I'll pour heavy for friends too though!
I‚Äôve taken the same approach. I really like Bookers but found most of their 2017 batches to be very ‚Äúmid B level‚Äù and a step back from a strong 2015 into 2016 (never had this one). Just hard to drop 70 bucks on a ‚Äúfine‚Äù whiskey with lots of other options out there.
When I was visiting Chicago it was 55 and I passed because it is so easy to find in Michigan. I forgot state minimum is 80 on it. 
Nice, where at?
I did not like this bottle until recently, but now that it's down to the last little bit I'm enjoying it more. I thought of it as having kind of a weird, herbal funk or something that always put me off. But I just really enjoyed this pour.
Instead of ice try adding water, about 1/2 tsp at a time until it's at a drinkable proof that you like. But if you prefer it on the rocks, nothing wrong with that.
Yeah, I never did add water so maybe you're right
It's the only bookers I've had, I bought it during that whole price hike fiasco just to say I've tried it. And yeah I agree, it was a 4 or 5 for most of the bottle's life. And since I always hear about the batch consistency with these I had just written off bookers in general. But I enjoyed these last few pours a little more, cant explain it.
That‚Äôs good advice. I recently did my first review (wrote it in a journal) and felt like I needed more. I‚Äôll start doing that from now on. 

Maybe one day I‚Äôll feel comfortable enough to post on reddit.
And I just recently got into Scotch (still prefer bourbon), so $70 gets me a really good bottle. I can spend a lot less and get a fantastic bottle of bourbon.
It's $69.99 at Binny's. Total Wine in Wisconsin has it for $59.99 I think.
Binnys in Chicago has a bunch of store pics from 2004. 
Ahhh I see. I‚Äôve always enjoyed Bookers myself. Nice review!
The fun of reviewing is kind of challenging yourself(for me anyway). I'm still not totally comfortable with it, and half the reviews I set out to do don't even yield anything postable. But something about knowing I'm gonna post it makes me take it more seriously than I otherwise would. "
"Review #59, Wolfburn Aroura",,https://i.redd.it/i7ofs10d8g411.jpg,"Wolfburn is one of the youngest distilleries in Scotland, having just started producing it's first spirits in 2013. According to the info on the bottle this was aged in Bourbon casks for 3 years, and then finished in Oloroso sherry casks for an undetermined amount of time. Since this was a recent release, some simple math tells us this isn't older than 3-4 years. I found it on sale for $30 which pretty much meant I had no choice but to check it out, especially since it's 46% and NCF and no color added.

*****

**Wolfburn Aurora sherry oak, 46%**

**Nose:** Vanilla, cake frosting, honey, brine, light plum and apple fruitiness, floral perfume, wood funk. Sweet and pleasant, with minimal sherry influence.

**Taste:** Sweet fruit and honey, vanilla, apple and pear, Gritty and malty sweet grain notes that give it some nicer body. It's sweet and malty with a light fruity touch. Smooth and mellow, not young or harsh tasting in any way.

**Finish:** Malty and more of that light, sweet fruitiness. It finishes sweet with vanilla, rich malt and mild spice.

*****

This is such a pleasant and tasty Scotch, I would not have guessed it's only 3 or 4 years old. All my experience with young Scotch so far has been heavily peated Islays that use their youthful brashness to their advantage, but this is completely different. It tastes smooth and refined, sweet with some decent complexity. The sherry influence seems very light but masterfully executed, lending just the right amount of light fruit to the sweet, delicious malt. It's a light enough Scotch that I think it easily could have been ruined by chill filtering it and bottling at 40%, so mad props to Wolfburn for bottling this right because it's good.

Great review. This has been one of my favorite finds this year. 
Nice notes...you definitely captured the flavor profile well. I don't quite like it as much as you do (a little too malty to me) but for $30 it was a slam dunk. 
Got it from my dad years ago, doesn't look like it's too hard to find.

Too...malty? I don't understand these words together, you're just speaking nonsense man! I'm a malty fiend, not what I was expecting with this one but it's surprisingly good."

*****

**SMWS 35.190 ""Hot apple and cinnamon sponge,"" Glen Moray 16, refill sherry butt, 59.5%**

**Nose:** Wow, I instantly get the reference to ""hot apple and cinnamon"" in the name. It's like a christmas potpourri. Chocolate, baking spices, toasted cinnamon wood, rich warm fruit, sweet strawberry.

**Taste:** Dark, syrupy cherry and tart fruit hits big. Gets gritty and chocolatey in a real nice way, warm fruit, baking spices, toasted oak, cinnamon

**Finish:** Sweet burnt fruit(does that make sense?) that peaks real bright, with rich chocolate, cinnamon and wood spice

*****

What I usually like about refill sherry is the light sherry influence and malt shining through, but this does not drink like a refill sherry butt at all. It's a big, rich, beautiful sherry influence. Not as ""winey"" or sulphury sweet as some sherry bombs, but not light hearted and easy drinking by any means. Sweet, warm, big and fun. Yummy stuff.

Delicious stuff, it really is. So far all the SMWS stuff I've had has been delicious, I'm honestly glad I don't have a membership because I really don't need any more temptation than I already have.

I'm an unapologetically huge fan of WHEATERS and Weller in general, so I'd like to extend another big thanks to him for hookin it up. 

*****

**Weller Antique 107 SiB select, UCF, Loch & Key pick, #3135**

**Nose:** Sweet creamy butterscotch, slightly bitter toasted wood, thin vanilla, burnt caramel, dark cherry. It's definitely oakier than I remember standard 107 being, and it has just enough tannic bitterness to possibly turn some people off, but I really like it.

**Taste:** Sweet and lightly oaky. Caramel and sweet cherry, honey, cinnamon red hot candy, friendly toasted oak that isn't as strong as the nose. The sweet creamy wheat is there but kind of thin and toned down. It's refreshing and ""pops"" with a gentle creamy sweetness.

**Finish:** Cherry cough syrup, creamy wheat, red hot cinnamon burn. Not really much of a finish, but pleasant enough.

*****

It's been a while since I've had the standard 107, but I do feel like this is a step up. At the very least, it's definitely different enough to be an interesting pour. It's a little oakier than I remember the standard 107 being, and it plays nicely off the sweet creamy wheat. As a big fan of the WHEATER profile, this is another nice example for me of the easy drinking sweet sip-ability they offer. It's a tad thin unfortunately (I've had lower 50% Bourbon that drank much fuller than this), and there's not much of a finish to speak of, or this would score higher. But overall it's pleasant and yummy :)

Nice review! Thanks for tagging me or else I fear I‚Äôm sure I would have missed it.  I enjoy the private picks, the UCF is a nice feature for the private pick to have (given the choice I can‚Äôt imagine I‚Äôd say no go ahead and filter it) but I still don‚Äôt see how secondary has gone so crazy over these.  Ppl were flipping this bottle!  Like you said six out of ten, I‚Äôm perfectly happy with this at around $30 or whatever I paid, and I don‚Äôt mind just having a pour over ice on a hot day there‚Äôs nothing precious about it to me.  Glad you are enjoying the bottle.
I need to see if this is the microbatch  UCF version I have from L&K.  They have a couple of them. Maybe I'll review mine.  Probably about a 5.5 for me on your scale. 
Yeah it's thoroughly enjoyable, and it's a shame the hype makes it almost impossible to get. I kind of realized as an afterthought that it's UCF, not really sure that anything jumps out at me as being that much better as a result. Maybe it would be a little thinner or more boring? 
Yeah I'd be interested in seeing your take on it if it's the same one."

I'm still the new guy around here, aside from my love for bourbon and Irish being my # 2, I've really been wanting to try Laphroaig soon.   Any tips or recommendations. 
I love most islays, talisker was the first I ever tried and I was hooked. But drinking laphroig makes me nauseous idk if it‚Äôs just me. 
Normally I wouldn‚Äôt consider bringing a bottle outdoors. But hell, why not! 
You should post this pic to the Laphroig community on their website. It looks like a goddamn ad (and that‚Äôs a good thing).
I dunno.  Looks photoshopped to me...
Every time I drink this I get must feet notes anyone else with me on this?
Woah didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôre right it‚Äôs Island I kept thinking it‚Äôs islay. Love ardbeg never tried ledaig and longrow but will try them soon
I‚Äôve only tried the 10 wonder if I will have the same response to qc 
I'm tellin ya
Just be warned it has a pretty intense smoke that isn't for everyone. If you haven't tried much Scotch before, I'd recommend maybe starting off a little simpler with some Glenlivet 12 or Glenfiddich 12, and you could try some Johnnie Walker black label to see if the smoky profile suits you. These are all relatively cheap and easy to find at bars.
Try Laphraoig Quarter Qask before the 10y old.

The Smoke is not as intense as the from the 10 but he¬¥s more complex with a nice touch of oak.

The 10 year old could be ""overwhelming"" for you, in a bad way...
Talisker is heavily peated, but it's not an Islay scotch. Peated scotches from Islay tend to be much more phenolic and oceany, lots of funky and unique flavors can spring up compared to the cleaner smokiness of stuff like Talisker. Have you tried Ardbeg or Caol Ila? One of those might be more up your alley, or maybe some other non-Islay peated scotches like Longrow or Ledaig. 
I always bring a bottle camping, along with some sturdy glasses.
Can't tell if you're joking, but I'll take it as a compliment that I took a picture that good. Tbh I have no idea how to even use photoshop, but I assure you I'm pretty good at drinking/photographing my precious bottles. This pic was taken literally about 10ft from my tent at our campsite.
I don't get that specifically, but I can see it. Most of the descriptors for laphroaig and islay peat in general are of unpleasant things, but they just work together so well in a scotch somehow. 
Cool beans. There's all kinds of interesting scotches out there to suit whatever your tastes are, it's a fun journey. And who knows, you may come around to Laphroaig some day :P

And a little Reddit tip for ya, you can reply to a comment to create a single discussion thread, instead of continuously replying to the post over and over.

"Review #48, Redemption Rye 10yr barrel proof",,https://i.redd.it/dalryf3vxxz01.jpg,"This is sourced MGP Rye that is 10 years old, bottled at Barrel Proof, and costs less than $10 per year. I love me some MGP Rye so I really had no choice but to buy it.

*****

**Redemption Rye 10yr, batch 002, 58.1%**

**Nose:** Rich, darkly toasted wood. Clean and crisp Rye, peppery and minty. Black liquorice, chocolate, sweet burnt cherry, rich caramel, hint of dill but not overpowering. Familiar crisp MGP Rye shrouded in lots of rich, toasted wood.

**Taste:** Rich toasted chocolatey wood and strong, bright-ish peppery MGP Rye. This is dark, toasted and rich. Caramel, dark cherry sweetness, herbal and minty spice, lots of cinnamon and pepper, deliciously toasted oak. The minty dill is definitely there but it's been tamed by age and rich oak. It's perfectly toasted and rich with no tannic bitterness, and all while still retaining the fierce MGP ""Rye-ness."" Super drinkable at full proof too.

**Finish:** Minty, clean Rye takes over on the finish with caramel and black liquorice toasted wood. Leaves toasted and spicy.

*****

As someone who is a big fan of MGP but mostly familiar with sourced Willett SiB's, this one is much darker and richer than I'm used to which maybe makes sense considering the age. It manages to keep that MGP Rye profile that I know and love, but it's cloaked in lots of rich toasted oak, really delicious stuff. It delivers like only MGP can for me, it's the definition of Rye as far as I'm concerned.

This stuff is magic in a bottle, and I'm still pissed at myself for not picking up a second!

Also, if you happen to have a SAOS barrel proof bourbon around the same age, I highly recommend trying a pour of 1oz of each blended together...Barrel proof Bourye is pretty spectacular!
i'm working on an older bottle of the 8 year right now that tastes like a cask strength mgp rye should which is great.

side note - i hate these new bottles. they look dumb.
Great review buddy! Agree with your notes! I love it as well :) did you had 8y mgp rye from willett or saos? And how you compare them? 
Been wanting to try this one and your review only adds fuel to the fire. Love the 8 already
wish i could find one of these around here
I think you've convinced me I need some of this!
Nice review. Both the 8 and the 10 year are great, but I prefer the 8yr. The 10 is a little softer and drinks like 100 proof. The 8 yr packs more of a punch and drinks like a barrel proof rye.

I also had the same reaction to the string. Really don't like that it's easily tampered with. 

Does anyone know when the first and second batches were released? I didn't pay much attention to them originally due to the price tag.  
I don't, but I do have an infinity bottle going and it will get a pour of this for sure. So far it's all high proof MGP and WP SiB's. 
> side note - i hate these new bottles. they look dumb.

Agreed. I hate the stupid piece of string that they're using as a seal too.
Looks better than [these ones](https://m.imgur.com/NO5ZuAg) imo
i've had a lot of SAOS rye, willett rye, and have sampled few redemption 8/10s as well as owned a redemption 8. it all tastes mostly the same. 
Thanks, glad to hear you got to try this over there. I haven't had much SAOS SiB to compare, but it is similar to the 7/99 to me being a darker, richer MGP. The Willett SiB I've had drinks much brighter and crisper, more lively. I think I prefer the Willett, but this is just a different take on it and really delicious.
PM'd
Same
Yeah, me too.  The central KY shops act like they never got it - and not in the normal ""I know nothing"" sort of way.  I wonder if our distributor just didn't get much/any, which could be because the previous younger batches with the crazy wax sat around forever - in fact, some still do.
I kind of prefer Rye to be a little more spicy and feisty, so that 8yr does sound really good. I have some Willett 7 that is like that. This 10yr is more oaky and mellow, but it's an interesting take on MGP and it's nice to have one that's a little different than I'm used to. This 10yr I reviewed is batch 002 and it was just released earlier this year. Not sure when batch 001 was released.
Nice!  I have a barrel proof infinity myself and it's pretty tasty if I do say so myself!  
Is the string all that holds it on? When I first went to open the bottle there was no plastic shrink wrap seal, kind of weirded me out. I thought maybe I had already removed it and forgotten, but that's not like me.
This 10130918234x.  They use the same stupid string on the 18 year rye, too.
Give me tamper proof wax over string every time
i think the old ones were fine looking.  the extra dipping is a bit much, but way better than the new ones
i mean the old ones were plain and simple. nothing wrong with that. the new ones look like the definition of trying too hard. 
In the Boston area I see the wax bottles all the time.   I may have even grabbed a 7 year old that had been marked down to $70
Yep. No shrink wrap on these. Would be easy to try before you buy at a store that isn't well-staffed.
The string as a seal pretty much eliminates secondary market on this.
Personal preference I guess. When I first bought the bottle I was expecting that black one, but once I saw what it actually looked like I was pleasantly surprised."

>**Bourbon Production and Warehouse Update**
 
>As we continue to build more warehouses on our farm adjacent to the Distillery and increase our barrel storage, we are now able to roll away more bourbon for aging than ever before! Because of that, we are able to produce bourbon at full capacity, and earlier this year moved to a seven day operation schedule for the first time since 1973!
 
>In April we officially dedicated Warehouse AA, which is the first of 30 new warehouses to be built on our farm over the next 10 years, each of which will hold 58,800 barrels. As soon as we finished the construction of Warehouse AA at the beginning of this year, we began filling it with barrels right away. We are now beginning to fill Warehouse BB with barrels!
 
>The foundation for Warehouse CC has been poured and the first ricks are taking shape, and the ground is already prepared for Warehouse DD.

>You can view an aerial photo of our warehouse construction in the collage above.
 
>**Expansion efforts and tour modifications**
 
>Along with the warehouse construction mentioned above, we are continuing forward with a number of distillery expansions marking the first large scale structural expansion on our campus since the 1950s.
 
>This $1.2 billion dollar expansion is all part of our efforts to continue making more whiskey.
 
>We‚Äôre currently replacing our old 1951 boiler and will be working to install a new boiler throughout this summer and into September. You can view a photo of this work in the collage above.
 
>This July and August we will begin renovating our mash house and upgrading our cookers. We will be moving from three 10,000 gallon cookers to four 20,000 gallon cookers! We‚Äôre also planning to upgrade our cooling tower and make our condensers two and a half times larger.
 
>We are also moving ahead with our bottling hall relocation to make room for 12 new fermenters.
 
>We will begin vacating our old distribution center this summer as we begin upgrading the space with modernized bottling lines to allow for more efficiency and better capacity. We are also planning to add the new bottling hall to our tour routes in the future.
 
>Additionally, we just finished installing a brand new laboratory in our Eagle Rare Building and will soon begin transitioning our lab team and equipment into that space in the next few weeks. You can view an image of the new, empty lab above.
 
>With all of these construction projects taking shape, this summer we will be temporarily replacing our traditional Hard Hat Tour with a limited-run Expansion Tour during our annual summer shutdown in which we halt production to focus on necessary repairs and the above mentioned upgrades.
 
>The Expansion Tour will explore the backside of the Distillery and the areas we are expanding as we make room for our growing whiskey production. This tour will run Monday-Friday at 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. and Saturday at 10:30 a.m. You can find more information about this tour and make reservations here.

>**7 Millionth Barrel**
 
>We rolled out our seven millionth barrel produced since Prohibition on April 11th, marking a significant milestone of growth, and held an official dedication for the first warehouse built on our farm. Our Freddie Johnson had the honor of carrying on his father‚Äôs legacy, and rolled the seven millionth barrel into Warehouse V with a little help from his grandson. Freddie‚Äôs late father Jimmy Johnson was a former warehouse supervisor, and had notably rolled out each millionth barrel produced here since Prohibition.
 
>The seven millionth barrel was rolled into Warehouse V, the world‚Äôs smallest bonded warehouse, which was constructed specifically to house each millionth barrel produced at the Distillery following Prohibition.  Up until last month, Warehouse V held the six millionth barrel, which Jimmy Johnson had rolled out at age 92 on May 14, 2008.
 
>A private audience made up mostly of employees witnessed the historic milestone. Our employees also had the opportunity to sign the barrel before it was rolled away.
 
>It took nearly 10 years for us to replace our six millionth barrel with our seven millionth barrel, but we‚Äôre anticipating a much shorter turnaround for the eight millionth barrel as we continue to expand bourbon production and roll more and more barrels into the warehouses on the farm.
 
>We plan to bottle the bourbon from the six millionth barrel this summer and offer 375ml bottles of the bourbon to charities for fundraising efforts. Information about how to apply for a bottle will be announced online this summer.
 
>Check out a video compilation of the 7 Millionth Barrel arriving, being filled and rolled into the warehouse here.

>**Corn Crops Update**
 
>Last summer we planted 22 acres of a conventional strain of corn on our farm, and harvested it in November. It has been drying in our newly installed grain silo, which also sits of the farm where its temperature and moisture level is being monitored. Now, we are looking forward to cooking up that corn next month!
 
>At the end of this month, we‚Äôre planning to plant our next crop of corn on the farm. Each year we‚Äôve grown a different strain of corn on our farm so each year in the future there will be a unique release. In 2016 we grew Japonica Striped corn on the farm, and the year before grew Boone County white corn, the same strain of corn that Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. used at the Distillery in 1870. This year we‚Äôre planning to grow Neon Pink Popcorn. Years from now when we bottle the bourbon made from this bright pink corn we plan to donate the proceeds from the bottle sales to breast cancer research.
 
>Each crop harvested on our farm is being distilled and aged on site to one day become expressions of ‚ÄúSingle Estate‚Äù bourbons. Name, age or price of this future bourbon is still to be determined.

>**OFC Fermenter**
 
>You may recall our recent discovery of the distillery foundations and fermenters buried under the floor of our OFC Building from when Col. E.H. Taylor, Jr. was distilling here in the late 1800s. We excavated the site with the help of a bourbon archaeologist and have now preserved the space and launched the E.H. Taylor Tour that includes that discovery.
 
>Our work in the OFC Building is not yet complete though. We are now working to recommission one of the fermenters we uncovered and use it to produce Old Fashioned Sour Mash similar to how Col. E.H. Taylor, Jr. did during his time here.
 
>We cleaned up some of the bricks we uncovered during the excavation and used them to line the top of the fermenter, and are now preparing to reline the fermenter with copper, which we anticipate will arrive around the end of the month.

>You can view a photo of this fermenter as it currently appears in the collage above.

Good info
If I recall correctly, when it comes to sheer output for American whiskey, JD and JB still lead by a significant margin, is that still the case? 
They just produced their 7 millionth barrel in 75 years and they are expanding to be able to store 1.75 million more barrels? That's quite the growth. Thanks for posting this.
Looking forward to trying some of that breast cancer bourbon!
Planning tater exciting releases decades ahead!
Great post. We all are gonna have a lot of drinking to do. Anyone else worried about over capacity?
Buffalo Trace and Four Roses were my favourite distilleries when I went a few years ago! 
Woodford reserve 'corn to cork' tour was fantastic, got to sample bourbon straight from the barrel. They also go very in depth in explaining all the processes behind making and bottling.  Just be sure to reserve in advance because they only take 6 people at a time and i believe only two days a week. 
Yup
I had tried to read all this as best I could, but your math really puts it in perspective. So now I'm glad I posted it too!

I come from an industrial background in my work, so it's really interesting to see this whole thing simply as a production plant. They have specific processes to make their product, and output is gonna be limited by the weakest link in their production chain. It's not as simple as just ""making more Whisky,"" because they still need somewhere to age it. And so they need more fermenters to produce more Whiskey than they are sending out, in order to fill all these new warehouses. And then there's all the infrastructure to support it all like boilers, cooling towers, electrical, piping, etc that has to be updated and improved. They have to expand the entire process, and even though we think of them as a big, rich company their capital isn't infinite so they have to do it as efficiently as possible. And they have to do it all without interrupting current production. It really is a huge feat.
I took the Hard Hat tour that they offer last week and they said that they are building a new warehouse for the barrels every 5 months for the foreseeable future. 
That's pretty much my plan haha. I'm looking forward to hopefully getting my first bottle of BTAC or Pappy in 10-15 years.
Relative to the size of Sazerac the amount spent here isn't all that much. Clearly Saz sees a lot of potential.

"Review #57, Laphroaig 15",,https://i.redd.it/w3cbnlk77cz01.jpg,"[deleted]
There were two versions of Laphroaig 15yr: the original release which was discontinued in 2009, then a re-release in 2015 for the distilleries 200th anniversary. I'm not sure which one this is, but I would guess it's most likely the latter. Sample is courtesy of u/ebvigilante who can maybe help clear it up(although this swap is from quite a while back).

*****

**Laphroaig 15, 43%**

**Nose:** Clean and soft smoke, brine, sweet vanilla, light fruitiness and malt. It's Islay, but in a very clean and reserved way.

**Taste:** Sweet and soft. Gentle peat, warm caramel maltiness, light-hearted vanilla, lightly sweet fruitiness

**Finish:** Leaves sweet and ashy, with lightly charred peat. A nice combination I haven't seen a lot before.

*****

A side of Laphroaig I haven't seen before, light and easy and downright pleasant. It retains it's signature peatiness but in a softer, more approachable way and with a nice amount of vanilla and sweet fruitiness. For people who think that the true measure of a Whisky is smoothness, and that older=better, this would be proof. I see it as another way to enjoy Laphroaig, a different take on their malt that is thoroughly enjoyable in it's own way. Have to deduct points unfortunately for the low ABV that leaves this a little watered down, which no doubt contributes to it's smoothness.

2015 cairdeas is still king for me too. And yeah it's a bit too smooth, but good for what it is imo. I remember when it was available a store had them for about $60. I didn't understand at the time that it was a limited release, always meant to pick one up but never did. I think it would have been good at that price, a nice easy sipper.

"Review #56, (the redemption of) Laphroaig Cairdeas 2017",,https://i.redd.it/wptuwvmrphy01.jpg,"Being the Laphroaig fanboy that I am, I bought this Cairdeas when it was first released about 8 months ago. Unfortunately I was a little disappointed upon opening it, as I had been with the 2016 Madeira, and vowed to stop buying these automatically. However, unlike the 2016, it's been slowly growing on me, and I finally sat down for a review with the last couple of pours from the bottle. I then found an old review from when I first opened it, and thought it was an interesting example of how time and oxidation can change a Whisky for the better, so I thought I would post them both. 

2017's release was a cask strength version of the Quarter Cask bottling, which is partly aged in smaller casks to impart more wood influence on the Whisky. 

*****

**Laphroaig Cairdeas 2017, Cask Strength Quarter Cask, 57.2%**

*****

**newly opened bottle**

**Nose:** Rich, heavy, medicianl peat. Slightly bitter old wood. Cocao and Creamy rich leather. It has a dank, charred sweetness. The woodiness is kind of sharp

**Taste:** Sweet peat, cocao, gritty woodiness that is kind of unpleasantly musty and bitter. Some dry sweetness, not as pleasantly sweet as the nose though. With some air the rich chocolate comes out more and the wood mellows nicely.

**Finish:** light peat and brown sugar sweetness that's not too dark and not too bright, leaves with a nice peaty barrel char and some mild menthol

*****

**last pour**

**Nose:** Right off the bat there's tons of chocolate, vanilla, and wood, but then charred peat kicks in with lots of medicinal bandaid, caramel, menthol, ashy charred oak

**Taste:** Ashy and charred peat, super chocolatey, sweet barrel char, caramel, tar, peppery menthol

**Finish:** Sweet and oaky peat, leaves chocolatey rich with sweet ashy char.

*****

When this bottle was new, there were too many unpleasant harsh and bitter wood notes, which seemed to have really mellowed over time into a creamier, richer chocolate. There's still lots of char and ash here too, but it stays pleasant and sweet and never quite reaches that black liquorice level that I've had in other Scotches. It feels remarkably well balanced at this point for still having so much wood influence, something I did not feel at all when I first opened it. Over the course of 8 months this has gone from a bitter oak bomb to a wonderfully sweet, wood-rich peat.

Great review!  I really enjoyed the sample of this I had.

I‚Äôve noticed a few other cask strength bottles I‚Äôve had really benefited from the accidental slow oxidation of sitting in my cabinet.  Talk about slow decanting!  
That's one nice pour!
This is especially true of cask strength sherry for me, it needs lots of time to open up I find.
Sometimes it's hard to gauge how much is left on the last pour haha. Besides, it's no good trying to pussyfoot around and stretch out the last bit of a bottle.
My findings would concur!  I‚Äôve discovered I need to be a bit more patient that i had thought necessary.
So true. I‚Äôve been there. You pour it out and think, dat‚Äôs a good one, better get drinking! I‚Äôm glad to see though, that you didn‚Äôt give up on that bottle."
"Review #55, Octomore 8.1",,https://i.redd.it/zkmhcmg6yby01.jpg,"This one is aged entirely in first fill American oak casks, distilled in 2008 from 100% Scottish Barley harvested in 2007, and aged for 8 years which is just slightly older than the standard 5-6 years these Octos usually get. Sample is courtesy of u/Ethanized

*****

**Octomore 8.1 ""Masterclass,"" 8yr, 59.3%**

**Nose:** Classic Octomore, I'm pretty sure I could pick this out blind. Huge, meaty peat, menthol, white cake and vanilla frosting, bbq meat, caramel, a metallic crispness, tart berry

**Taste:** Epically huge and meaty, again classic Octo. Clean and sweet caramel, huge peat, brine, delicious vanilla icing, lemon, fruity berry. It's both heavy and sharp at the same time, a dank and thick peat that shimmers with a sweet metallic crispness. 

**Finish:** Loooong, sweet and peaty. Just a hint of ashy char, very clean yet heavy peat with lots of sweet vanilla. Leaves with huge mouth numbing peat, fucking yum.

*****

With the price these Octomores fetch, and the fact that it seems to have gone up with these latest 8.X releases, I wish I could say I didn't enjoy this as much as past releases. But goddamn it this stuff is as good as ever, no question in my mind that they are still in top form. It's just huge and delicious and each sip performs beautifully from nose to finish like it's my first time trying it. This one presents more sweetness and vanilla in a crowd-pleasing dessert kind of way, but along with the standard issue huge and meaty peat that fills the senses. I tend to like the wine finished ones a little more, but this is without a doubt my favorite X.1, and I'm probably gonna have to get a bottle of this.

Great review, I picked up a 7.1 over Christmas and I really liked it and now I want to try all the others I can! I'll have to get around to doing a review sometime. (have way too many back logged now).

Glad you enjoyed it! I kind of found the vanilla/cake notes a little out of place (works with other Laddie's, but not Oct), but I""m told that's classic Octomore like you say. My first was 6.1, which was all tar, so I guess that's always been my benchmark.
I finally got to try an Octomore (the 10 year) at a bar and I really loved it. My wallet is going to hurt soon... 
Yeah this one is a far cry from 6.1. It has a lot of the sweetness of a wine finished release with none of the funk, pretty interesting bottle. It's amazing how much variety there is in Octomore while still maintaining that quintessential Octo-ness. 

Have you had any .2 or .3's, what's your thoughts on those?
I've had the recent 2's and 3's. Love the 2's because of the wine and peat combo. The 3's are ok, I like them just fine, but preferred 6.1 over 6.3 because 6.1 was more in your face, and 7.1 over 7.3 because  7.1 had a really nice pineapple note. 8.3 is a little more rough around the edges than 8.1 it seems, but I like the flavors."
"Review #54, Craigellachie 13",,https://i.redd.it/a76xxfmf8xw01.jpg,"**Craigellachie 13, 46%, NCF**

**Nose:** Robust bready malt, warm vanilla, white cake, sweet crisp pear. Slight floral perfume and fruitiness, but overall it's very malty and thick and meaty, and I'm not complaining one bit.

**Taste:** Sweeter than the meaty nose, full bodied and big flavor. Big barley malt, sweet fruitiness, some gritty caramel and brine, pepper, creamy buttered bread, vanilla.

**Finish:** Thick and gritty barley sweetness that you can almost chew on, finishes sweet and pleasant and creamy.

*****

I'm a sucker for a Bourbon barrel malt bomb, and this is just so completely up my alley. Not as complex or fruity to me as some other malt bombs out there, but it's a malty freight train and it hits the fucking spot. This is right up there with Old Pulteney for me as a ridiculously delicious yet cheap entry level malt.

Can you name some other malt bombs you enjoyed (perhaps more)? I'm looking at exploring that space more & wondering what stands out from the crowd as malty goodness.
Really???? I have a bottle and the after taste for me tastes like soap
Yup, it's just good.
Oh boy, puttin me on the spot. AnCnoc 12 comes to mind, Old Pulteney 12, balvenie 12 single barrel. The discontinued Glenlivet 16 Nadurra. Compass Box Oak Cross is a blended malt. I liked a Balblair 10yr a lot, but they don't have standard releases so you never know what you're getting. Now that I think about it a lot of really good malty Scotches I've had were IB's, because they seem a lot more likely to bottle and then clearly label something simply as ""Bourbon barrel."" Maybe someone else can help out with some others I might be forgetting, I'd always like to hear more too.
I haven‚Äôt had the reviewed whisky, but I‚Äôd guess that Balvenie 12 Doublewood would be a good start. Technically has sherry influence, but comes across as very malty to me, and stronger flavor than baseline Glenfiddich or Glenlivet.
I just killed the bottle tonight, and honestly from the very first sip to the very last I got nothing but sheer enjoyment out of this bottle. Different strokes I guess.
I had that problem with Balvenie 12 for ages. I just put the bottle away and came back 8 months later and now I don‚Äôt get the soap note. My palate/preferences change a lot so when I dislike something I put it away and come back.
I don‚Äôt taste soap but the after taste is the worst part for me as well.
I feel like the review took too many damn words to say exactly this. From the first sip
That's a good list.

Other good unpeated ex-bourbon cask malts that come to mind - of the OB's: Deanston 12 (piecrust), Teaninich 10 Flora & Fauna (very crisp and acidic - like a nice chablis), various Bruichladdichs (if you don't mind lactic notes), and the Glenmorangie 10, 18 & Astar. If you don't mind STR cask notes, Cotswolds is putting out a good product at a young age with a nice thick mouthfeel. Amrut, especially the cask strength.

Much more rare and hard to find but worth trying if you come across one: age stated Glen Ord (very dry and malty), and Dalmore has released some 10-12 yo vintage year dated bottles at 46% ABV for the French market which are ex-bourbon and have more heft and bite than their other OB bottles. Also any of the Bere barley or other heirloom barley malts that have been put out over the years by Bruichladdich, Glenmorangie, Glenlivet and others.

On the IB side I've had particular luck with Imperial, Linkwood and Glenburgie.
I wonder if I just got a bad bottle/batch
Plus there would be plenty of in bottle oxidation in that period.
Ok. I think I‚Äôll hold off drinking it for a couple months
Haha, yea. That might be a good way to do a future review.
Nice additions, like I was saying though a lot tend to be IB's which are aged and bottled in a very simple and straight forward way. I almost mentioned Laddie, because it satisfies me in a similar way but it does have lots of wine barrel influence. Also you reminded me of springbank local barley, the 11yr I tried was the maltiest malt bomb I've ever had. Made me want to try more bere barley stuff, especially the bruichladdich one. And what's STR cask?
I tell ya man, sometimes my taste buds go south. What was amazing one time really kind of sucks the next. I‚Äôve learned though, never give up.
Word. Not saying that the whisky will change much‚Äîmy Balvenie was still pretty full and oxidation was minimal‚Äîbut rather that if I wait long enough I come around to liking it. Worked with Laphroaig üòõ
The SB 11 yo local barley is a really good one, I like that malt a lot. If we are bringing mildy peated expressions into the conversation I'd add the Benromach 10 specifically and Glen Garioch more generally. Also the Kilkerran WIP series.

STR = Shaved, Toasted and Re-charred, developed by the late Dr. Jim Swan. It is an effective way to get some wood-driven flavors quickly into a young spirit, but some folks don't like it, viewing it as a technique which smothers the underlying character of the malt with overly aggressive cask engineering.

Cheers
Oh yeah, kilkerran is a good one to mention too. Haven't had the newer cask strength, but the bourbon barrel WIP was amazing. Interesting about the STR, that would almost give you a new barrel to age in. I knew about recharring, but not sure how common or widespread it is."

*****

**2004 Glenfarclas 11yr Single Cask, 63.4%**

**Nose:** Sticky sweetness, deep fruitiness, strawberry, rich woody funk, dark chocolate, some nice caramel and warm malt shining through. After adding water(see below) it all melds and softens beautifully into a thick, cohesive medley of sweet chocolatey fruitiness.

**Taste:** Super hot and sticky sweet, this drinks like a high proof Bourbon like Stagg jr or ECBP and I love it. With some water it's less of a heat attack and more of a thick, viscous experience. Dark, rich fruitiness, cherry cough syrup, rich chocolate, orange, thick malt, caramel, gritty wood.

**Finish:** The finish builds brightly sweet and fun, then slowly descends into earthier, fruity sweetness where it rides out super thick and long. Stays with me forever, I basically haven't stopped tasting this stuff since I started drinking it.

*****

This...might be the best sherried Scotch I've ever had. I'm very impressionable though and easily distracted by whatever is right in front of me, so let's just say it's definitely one of the best. In any case it's a real treat. It's just huge, with absolutely none of the funk or brooding, sulphury wine-ness that can put me off with sherry sometimes. It has the perfect mix of fun punchy sweetness, darkly rich fruit, and THICC maltiness. Awesome stuff!

Oh man, that sounds amazing. Great review. 
It's only gonna be a matter of time until Glenfarclas single casks become the new hot ticket item instead of the Glendronach ones. 
Great review, and I‚Äôm really glad you enjoyed this! 
It seems like they're already pretty expensive though whenever I've seen them.
Thanks, and thanks for sending it. Like I said I don't always love sherried Scotch but this stuff was really good. It blows away a bottle of Glendronach 12 Single Cask I had, and I preferred the 105 over the A'bunadh, so I think I'm a Glenfarclas fan.
how Much are we talking and sadly for me, Binny‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt have any.
This one was only EUR 60!
I've only seen ""family cask"" single casks, and they're usually $200-$300+. Although that is for 18yr and older usually, so I guess it might not be as bad as it seems. Those Glendro's used to go pretty cheap though, like $10 per year.
Holy shit that's awesome, I bet you regret not buying another. Such odd circumstances too, a special bottling for a cruise ship.

60! = 8.32098711274139e+81


Yea, still kind of pricey. Yes, those Glendro‚Äôs use to be reasonable and available. No more I‚Äôm afraid. Here‚Äôs a mail order site that has some interesting looking Glenfarclas https://www.whiskysite.nl/en/. I‚Äôve never ordered from them. Has anyone else?
Yep. It definitely seemed odd but apparently this is the cruise line that hosts an annual [whisky fair](https://www.vikingline.se/hitta-resa/kryssningar/temakryssningar/whiskykryssningar/whiskymassa-cinderella/).

"Review #47, High West Double Rye, MWND finish",,https://i.redd.it/gcf61ytawwu01.jpg,"High West's Double Rye is a mix of 2 different Ryes(a 2yr, 95% Rye and a 16yr, 51% Rye), and then this one was finished for 8 months in a MWND barrel. But MWND is just Rendezvous Rye finished in Port barrels, so I guess this was aged in used Port barrels? Sample courtesy of u/iDriveAvolvo

*****

**High West Double Rye, finished 8 months in Midwinter Nights Dram barrels, 49.6%**

**Nose:** First impression is that there's lots of yummy toasted barrel influence here. Vanilla, burnt caramel, dark and rich rye with plenty of sharp herbal spice. Some faint sulphury bitterness and wine funk, it's background enough to be interesting but not intrusive.

**Taste:** Clean caramel-rich Rye, a little thin even at the proof, but very clean and delicious flavor. Sweetly dark brown sugar, nice toasted barrel char, vanilla, toasted marshmallow, mellow Rye spice, faintly sweet cherry.

**Finish:** Builds sweeter and a little brighter, and the wine finish shows up more. Creamy Rye and strawberry fruitiness with a fair amount of peppery Rye spice.

*****

This is balanced and delicious and quite drinkable. The wine influence is minimal or at least not very intrusive, which is very much to my liking as I feel like MWND and other wine influenced Ryes(and Scotches for that matter) can be too overwhelmingly wine dominant. It has a dark and rich character, but it's kind of hard to pinpoint if it's just the toasted, woody nature of this stuff or a result of actual Port influence. It drinks a little thin on the mouthfeel despite the rich and toasted flavor, but not enough to really detract too much.

*****

**Smooth Ambler Old Scout Single Barrel Bourbon, 8yr, 60.81%, by Sarah**

**Nose:** Huge toasted wood that is beautifully rich, warm and smooth. Sludgy chocolate, smooth corn sweetness, warm orange zest, herbal spice that cuts through nicely

**Taste:** A charred and woody explosion of beautiful, rich oak. The perfectly toasted wood is just so huge on this. It's not bitter or tannic oak, it's huge, warm, rounded, and just plain smooth. And rather than dominating it kind of sets the stage for tons of brighter cherry sweetness and lively, exciting spice to build on. Rich chocolate, orange zest, so big and sweet and oaky.

**Finish:** A long, cherry sweet finish with lots of minty spice that leaves the mouth tingling.

*****

Just wow, this is so fucking good. I think this is the 3rd or 4th SAOS SiB I've had, and the others were good and all but didn't do much for me. This is light years beyond those. It's huge but not hot, rich and oaky but not tannic or overly charred, plenty of spice but not an herbal attack on the senses. It tastes so perfectly rounded and complete, like this is as good as it could hope to be. I'm finally starting to understand all the love I see for these single barrels, but from what I've seen there's some interesting variation. Not variation in quality necessarily, but in profile.

My favorite of the bunch I‚Äôve tried for now, it‚Äôs a 2014 bottling by Sarah. Not a store picks, just a regular single barrel. I‚Äôm glad you liked it. Great review! 
https://imgur.com/a/I5uTI
I really need to try one of these low proofed SAOS SiBs. They get a lot of love online and seem appealing. However, I think the branding on these bottles is awful. If I saw one on a shelf I wouldn't even consider it unless I already knew it was good stuff. I think the contradiction label is their best.
On the SAOS SiB stuff I much prefer the low Proof barrels. 
Haven‚Äôt seen one younger than 10 for a while.  Sarah is just one of the employees at saos, not sure how much she picks them, might just be who does the bottling.  There are some that value Sarah picks above all others which I find amusing
My favorite too, thanks for sending it! It's so drinkable at that proof too. Weird because before this my other favorite was super low proof for a Bourbon, like 48% or something. 
I have an Ashton pick. Maybe Kutcher moonlights as a distillery worker! 
Yeah, some of the references I found were people saying how Sarah picks some of the best Whiskey. I think I saw the phrase ""Bourbon Goddess"" somewhere.
I agree, for a 60%, it‚Äôs not hot, well balanced, a real treat. The best SAOS I‚Äôve were this one and a 9yo around 60%. The dude I‚Äôve bought the bottle from had two of them, I‚Äôm kicking to have bought both of them. 8yo and 9yo are the sweet spot, always on the look out for those, but I can‚Äôt some. What‚Äôs the next sample you‚Äôll be reviewing ? Yours were excellent, no exception, I‚Äôve already killer those ;-) 
She's just works on the bottling line. She's the main person who does labels and signs, but there are a few others too. I met her on a tour this fall: nice gal (like all their employees).

She doesn't pick as far as I know: certainly not regularly.
I might just go for the other 10yr SAOS SiB you sent, keep it going with these Amblers and see how it compares.
Great idea, cheers! "
"Review #52, Johnnie Walker Double Black",,https://i.redd.it/5g7ei4f11dr01.jpg,"This is Johnnie Walker's next step up from the standard black label, which is their smoky 12 year bottle. Sample courtesy of u/tenpiecenugget.

*****

**Johnnie Walker Double Black, 40%**

**Nose:** Nice briny peat, total Islay nose. It smells chocolatey and thick, ashy wood char, burnt caramel, delicious.

**Taste:** Little bit of a watered down disappointment after the wonderful nose, but still nice. Clean smoke and boggy brine, chocolate fudge, a smoky and woody sweetness, some minty mouthtingle in the background. Musty in a pleasant way. Some root beer char, but the low ABV keeps it from really kicking in.

**Finish:** Rich chocolate and caramel, sweet with light smoke

*****

This is really nice stuff, but the low ABV definitely hurts it. I feel like even at just 46% this would be fantastic. It has a really nice aggressive Islay-style peatiness, but at the same time a tamer clean smokiness on the palate, and it's all kind of tempered down with rich chocolate and toasted wood notes. It's a really interesting and delicious balance that makes me contemplate on the art of blending. And it's hard to explain but it kind of drinks like a single malt, maybe there's more malt in this blend? Or maybe I'm just talking out my ass. Doesn't have the 12yr age statement that the standard black label has, but that doesn't seem to hurt it one bit. Young peat often works quite well for me anyway. If this can be found closer to the price point of the standard black label, it's vastly superior imo.

Agree wholeheartedly with you..I wish they made all Johnny walkers with a higher ABV.  I would gladly pay extra for it
I mean that's always gonna be true with a decent low ABV Scotch, but I just feel like this is a greater disservice than usual. I really feel like this could be an exceptional Whisky. If that silly ""Director's Cut"" had been a high proof Double Black instead of standard black label, I might have got one."
"Review #10, Lot 40 Cask Strength",,https://i.redd.it/2gwyds7d10q01.jpg,"Sample courtesy of u/RudolphSchmidt, who probably contributed to a few reviews of this stuff when he sampled out an entire bottle on r/Scotchswap (RIP). It's a cask strength version of a Canadian Rye that I rather enjoyed. My sample says ""B# 4129,"" I'm assuming maybe that's batch number? Because I don't think this stuff is a Single Barrel.

*****

**Lot 40 Cask Strength, #4129, 55%**

**Nose:** Fierce and herbal rye spice, the same funky and interesting dill I remember from the standard Lot 40, perfectly toasted wood, sweet brown sugar. All the crisp and minty notes I look for in a Rye

**Taste:** Crisp and clean, there's no mistaking that this is a Rye. Minty and herbal Rye that is just as fierce as the nose was. Cherry red hot and cinnamon that sets fire to my mouth in a good way. More warm dill goodness. Sweet brown sugar and a kind of bready creaminess. Tart green apple fruitiness

**Finish:** Creamy caramel, sweet brown sugar with lots of cinnamon and spice that leaves the mouth tingling.

*****

As a big fan of REAL Rye(meaning Rye that doesn't taste like a fucking Bourbon), this stuff is fantastic. It runs through a checklist of all the notes I look for in a Rye, and the flavors are presented so crisp and clean and vibrant. A sweet, spicy rye bomb with a heapin' helpin' of dill, it jumps out of the glass and explodes on the palate. Gimme more!

**Finish:** Morphs beautifully into big sweet & bright cherry, creamy Bourbon, and huge minty spice, holds it real nicely 

*****

Yet another delicious FRPS. I hear a lot about these F recipe's being super minty, I think I even saw someone comment once about them tasting like toothpaste. The recipe guide lists F as ""herbal,"" so I'm guessing that's what people are referring to. I did indeed get some mouth-numbing herbal character on the taste and finish of this one, but not any more so than plenty of other Bourbons and that hasn't always been my experience with other F's. If anything the unifying theme for me has been that the F's seem a bit brighter and sweeter than others, with the exception of one super dark 12yr I had. And I've also really loved every F I've had, with the exception of that same 12yr. But honestly every recipe seems pretty random to me and subject to a lot of bottle variation, so I still don't feel close to unlocking any ""favorite"" recipe. I seem to just love them all!

I just finished the same recipe & select by Binnys from ‚ÄúBottled on May 15, 2014‚Äù 6.1% 

Took me a while to finish it (last night) cause it was very minty & full bodied, so it came across very strong. But at the same time have had other OESF with way less mint.

While these FR selects are a great value& I‚Äôm gonna try to start asking for a sample before purchase  - cause there‚Äôs a bit too much variation. Obviously everyone has a different palate. 50-65 is still pushing it for me on the bank. 


I could get more serious about finding and trying F recipes.  I believe I've only had one, and that was a heavy, not complex version.  Since a mint julep is one of the few mixed drinks I like with bourbon, and since I always look positively for mint in a rye, the mint part of F would probably be fine with me.  Your review got my attention.  Thanks."

Right now some beauitiful St Patty's Day snow is falling outside in this late California winter, and a sherried dram just felt so right. Sample courtesy of u/xreekinghavocx

*****

**Macallan Classic Cut 2017, 58.4%**

**Nose:** Fruity strawberry and cherry, rich raisins, chocolate, cinnamon, wood spice, creamy malt. A drop of water didn't change the character too much, but really enhanced everything. Reserved and mellow nose.

**Taste:** Sweet and fruity with some earthy nuttiness, sulphury wine, dark chocolate. Creamy caramel malt that melds beautifully with the darker fruitiness. Not punchy or sweet in-your-face sherry, it has an elegant and flowing character that is really nice. Not a ""sherry bomb"" so much as a ""sherry soaked malt.""

**Finish:** Dark fruitiness and rich chocolate, with mouth numbing menthol and spice, a feeling that I'm more familiar with in Bourbon than Scotch. Leaves darkly sweet and fruity, delicious.

*****

I'm not a huge fan of sherried Scotch, I never cared for the A'bunadh that everyone is always raving about around here, but I really enjoyed this one. I've always been a fan of the 12yr Macallan though, and this kind of personifies the Macallan character to me of rich, elegant and chocolatey sherry malt. But being Cask Strength doesn't just make it ""bigger"" or ""stronger,"" it's actually just better executed in general. More complete, more polished, more satisfying, which is exactly what Cask Strength is supposed to be all about.

I think I personally find lighter sherry finishes and sweet/punchy PX more to my preference though, or I might rate this higher. Because really I have nothing bad to say about this, except maybe it could use an age statement.

Very nice review.  As you pointed out in my review, we are definitely on the same page with impressions from this one!  

The Macallan irritates me as a distillery, but this was a good enough whisky to keep me interested still.  I might even buy another one of these later this year before they (presumably) start to disappear.
Nice write up!
Fantastic review. I think you‚Äôve really nailed what I like about this. Need to get my own review out. 
Nice review. That sums it up well. I think my review was right about there. Have you had the original CS and if so what are your thoughts?
Thanks man, and thanks for the sample
Thank you much, and thanks for reading! I often have trouble reviewing sherried malts, a lot of them tend to taste the same to me, and I'm not sure I know what dates or figs taste like lol. But Macallan has always had kind of a different character to me from other sherry bombs, that creamy chocolatey and fruity taste. Maybe it's the oloroso?
I had the [older red label Cask Strength](https://www.spink.com/lot/SFW26000030) as a mystery sample, and I loved it, hard to say how it compared to this though. I checked my notes and it was so rich that at first I thought it was Port finished peat, but as it mellowed I came around to it being big sherry. I also mentioned the perfect melding of malt and sherry, so sounds similar in that respect. Wasn't much of a reviewer when I tried it so that's all I got. I remember it being really big and warm and a little brighter than this seemed though.
I have a little bit of the older red label left, compared the two and thought the same thing. I‚Äôm coming around to this newer CS. It‚Äôs pretty tastee.
Right on, glad to hear my year old notes and memories made some kind of sense haha. I can still get this bottle, and I've been really tempted to go for it since I reviewed it. I don't often find sherried Scotches I enjoy this much. 

I actually have a sherried bottle I need to open though, Deanston 10 PX Cask Strength. I tried that one blind too and it was friggin amazing, really enjoyed it. I need to drink some more tonight, and either talk myself out of buying the Mac or talk myself into buying it, not sure which :D
Made perfect sense. It‚Äôs a good value too.

Deanston PX, sounds amazing. There‚Äôs only one way to know what to do, drink some more.

*****

**Longrow Red Pinot Noir, 12yr, 52.9%**

**Nose:** Sharp and powerful phenolic peat, toasted wood, vanilla, strawberry, tart berry sweetness, ashy char. Beautiful peaty and charred nose that kind of sneaks the sweetness in there really nicely, you have to look for it.

**Taste:** Strawberry and red wine give a sulphury yet gentle sweetness, along with warm earthy peat that isn't nearly as strong or in your face as the peaty nose. It has a lighter maltiness to it too, and lots of darker charred flavor with vanilla, toasted wood, and black liquorice

**Finish:** Long finish that carries on with the warm, sulphury sweetness then slowly descends into earthy peat, toasted wood and ashy char.

*****

A very interesting and enjoyable meld of peat and red wine, it's all very cohesive and well-layered. It's dark, toasted, peaty and sulphury but still has a kind of light and malty feel to it. And it's very sweet but not in a sticky, syrupy way. This is still the only Longrow Red I've had, and I really like it.

Oofff...that colour! (not that any of us judge whisky by its colour)
Nice review. I really like how Longrows are NCF and NCA - and it appears the Reds are also CS? I‚Äôm enjoying my way through Longrow Peated now and looking to pick up a Red next.

Cheers!
Noob question... is the use of the word ""peat"" in tasting notes entirely synonymous with ""smoke""?   I'm familiar with the Islay style whiskies, which I tend to think of as smokey, and fully understand that the smokiness comes from drying the grain over a smoldering peat fire.  But I'm just wondering if the use of the word ""peat"" in reviews like this implies something distinct from the smokiness.   Thanks.  
That‚Äôs a healthy pour! No wonder you enjoyed it ;). 

I wasn‚Äôt so impressed with this one. Peat and wine finishes are great, but I thought the Pinot was too subtle in this one. Maybe it needed a longer finish. I liked the Port edition a lot and would love to try the others. 
I've been researching wine finishes and noticed you also reviewed the kilchoman sauternes.  If price wasn't a factor, which do you think you'd go for?
This sounds great. I really like that earthy peat. I just picked up some 9 year old Longrow, Sauternes finish. Great stuff as well.
Yeah, I forgot to mention the color in the review! It's got this beautiful red hue to it, almost looks like a light red wine when you're pouring it.
Yeah, the Red's are all wine finished and cask strength.
No, I'd say they're different, or it might be more accurate to say they're the same thing that show up differently in different scotches. To me peat is more earthy and phenolic, smoke is cleaner. I remember talisker seeming more smoky to me than a lot of islays. But this is probably the kind of thing that varies from person to person and personal taste. If you search ""smoke vs peat"" in this sub you'll get some results, it's been brought up before.
Haha, it doesn't hurt! I don't pour like that with my normal drinking, but when I'm reviewing I like a big pour so I can really dive in and taste it. Always the full 2oz with samples too.

I think the subtle wine influence is what I actually liked, I'm not such a big fan of huge, overwhelming port or sherry bombs. I prefer a lighter finish where the malt shines through.
Oof, that's a tough one. I had to go back and re-read my review for the Kilchoman, but it seems like that one was kind of a different experience. It was more of a thick, creamy sweet beast, this Longrow is lighter and more of a fruity winey sweetness. Might have to say the Kilchoman if I were forced to choose, but really they're both excellent in their own way.
I think this is actually the only longrow I've had. I've had good experiences with sauternes scotch though, that sounds pretty interesting.
I see where you're coming from. Have you tried Arran Amarone? Posted my review a minute ago, and I found the Arran character still came through and wasn't overwhelmed by the wine finish. 
Haven't had that one, but I've really liked the wine finished Arrans I've had. I had an 18yr sherried SiB that was fantastic, not overly sherried at all. I may have got that from you actually. And I've got a 12yr Cask strength batch from them that's the same way.
If that Arran sherry cask was mine, it was 17 years, and yeah: it was amazing. Agreed that the 12 CS is excellent. My favorite of their core range. 
It was this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/ScotchSwap/comments/507pav/swap_11_with_uunbreakablesausage/
Yeah, that's the one. Nearly bought a close relative (not sure if it was the same cask) from the same shop but decided I'd try something new. "
When dumbass operators try to fix something themselves,,https://i.redd.it/gswdvf51djl01.jpg,"You should have torqued him out of it.
If i can't fix it with a pipe wrench its not my job any more.. sorry about that 
Not gonna lie, sometimes I reach for my torx when I run into hex 

Coworker slapped that on an impact didn‚Äôt he
That‚Äôs a windshield mount for a Raymond Reach truck. There is a new improved update kit for those.  The old style keeps coming loose, probably why they are trying to tighten the crap out of them. I‚Äôve found if you leave the mount on the lift cylinder, the one with a rubber grommet and lock nut, slightly loose, so the mount can float, the plastic piece in your picture will stay on the windshield. Crap design really. 
At least that shouldn't be too hard to fix...
Used to know a guy who ran an independent shop with just him and another guy, actually did pretty well for himself considering the size. He was getting old and definitely had reached or passed the ""stop giving a fuck"" stage in life. 

He had a good customer base but you could tell he was burned out and just really didn't care anymore. Basically your stereotypical cranky old man. Knew what he was doing, but hated dealing with people.

One time I was hanging out there, this guy brought his truck in because it needed trans work, but the customer didn't know what was wrong. Old man looked at it, told the customer what was wrong. Customer says thanks, but he'll do the work himself. You know, the typical ""I can't diagnose it but I know I can fix it, it can't be that hard"" type. 

Without missing a beat, old man tells him, ""Alright. Well, give me a call when you're done playing mechanic and I'll come tow it back over here, then charge you for everything else you fucked up in the process.""

Guy looks at him, walks outside, sits in his truck for a minute or two. Comes back in, hands over the keys.
my T30 looks like that... However it's because I reef on that thing.  Hasn't broken, the mild twist isn't detrimental to it's strength as I have found out.  And, if it really bothers me, I just have snap-on replace it next he visits...  
  
Also, if a hex strips out, sometimes hammering in a torx can make it come free.  Best to not strip the hex in the first place though.  I take my hex sockets and grind them on the bench grinder to make the bottom flatter.  They tend to wear out on the bottom and don't bite as deep, causing stripping of super tight fasteners.  Grinding the bottoms up a bit makes them bite better, and still Snap-On will replace the bit free of charge.
Now u can just hammer a hex bit in that bitch 
I know I'm looking at stripped bolts... but what's the black box?
hmmm this doesn‚Äôt fit. better apply some more pressure. 
When dumbass mechanics have time to complain of the work the equipment their fixing, and take all day to do it!
How the fuck did the bit twist counterclockwise? Is it left hand thread, or what? I'm lost...
Ugh.

If you don't have a hex, at least use some pliers. Doesn't work in every scenario, but in this one - the heads are out far enough. 

Or you know... just buy a hex multi-tool for $4
That's a new twist on a pun!
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs face it - you can‚Äôt Torquemada anything!‚Äù
I don't even want this guy handling a pipe wrench
I stripped the fuck out of the hex drive screws holding my locker hubs on... they were very rusty... so to get them out I pounded in an oversized torx bit since I didn't have any extractors. It required some careful patience, but it worked pretty well
I put the impact on [my torx](https://imgur.com/gallery/p3upx) all the time.... Now we wait for the guy with a 3/4 drive  t100 to show up.
Can work the other way around but only if you know if you are about to strip it and also put on a rachet or screwdriver and not a power tool
Wow spot on, you fucking nailed it man. And yeah it's totally a shit design. I would just weld it but I don't really wanna weld on a hydraulic ram. We're sick of messing with them and we actually just took them off, not really necessary. Glad you found a solution though, nice job.
I'm more mad about my torx bit, and the fact that someone so stupid is working here. Most of us learned as children how to fit shapes into the right hole.
It's a mount for a windshield on a forklift
He must have done it while trying to loosen the bolt, not tighten it.
Man, screw this thread.
Raymond mechanic for 13yrs. Forklift mechanic for 22yrs. If you need the kit part number it‚Äôs 1206511. It is a two piece Z connection between the lift cylinder and the windshield mount. Again the original ones work if you leave them loose at the rubber grommet. Apparently the factory didn‚Äôt get the memo because they come from the factory cranked down. Those lift cylinders move just a little, enough to pull the windshield bracket off if mounted solid. Has to be a disconnect between the two. Be safe out there. 
Just rotate the torx bit backwards in the hole. That should straighten it out! /s.
you keep your tools open for anyone to access? rookie mistake
üòÖi goin say something lomg that lines to...maybe he needs go back to 1st garde abd relearn shapes
You can buy that torx bit for really cheap like $5 or if it's snap on or Matco you can have them warranty it 
I'll need to pitch a new idea
That's awesome, thanks. Like I said though I'm tired of dealing with them so we just decided to take them off. If I change my mind or decide to tackle it again I'll consider that though for sure. And who knows, I might hit you up again sometime if I ever have more problems with them ;)

I've worked on some forklifts in my time, but I'm just a general maintenance tech, so it's more of a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" situation.
If you don't mind me asking, do you bend wrenches for a HYG dealer in the US?
Hold on I've done that for my T30 a bunch ... and it works. Am I a stupid? Granted I've warrantied it out with Snap-On a few times, but it works pretty well in the short term.
Wow. Can't tell if retarded or master troll.
You hexed it!

#*Bake em away, toys.*
Not sure what you‚Äôre asking. I‚Äôll answer what I think you‚Äôre asking. I turn wrenches for a now Raymond factory owned dealer in the US. :)
A little column A, a little column B.
What'd you say, Chief?
I don't get it. It's a pun thread, and I got downvoted for a pun?
Gotcha! HYG is Hyster Yale Group. I write mobile work order dispatch software for some of their material handling dealers. If you were a Hyster-Yale tech there's about a 50/50 chance you're one of my users!

Maybe people didn't get the pun? Can you explain it for the slower folks in the room like me?

Not bad but not great. Malty and fruity with some mildly richer flavors, and wood funk that isn't too strong. The funk kind of adds an interesting element actually and keeps it from being too boring. I once saw someone describe a lot of these malty IB's as ""samey,"" which is a real good way to put it.

Reviews #43/44: standard Eagle Rare vs K&L pick (blind tasting),,https://i.redd.it/ojg0vbx6vel01.jpg,"Long story short, I recently found out that in addition to being 10 years old Eagle rare is also a Single Barrel Bourbon. But they don't put it on the label for reasons that have to do with the bottling line process. You can find out more information in a [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/7u5npk/some_info_on_the_eagle_rare_bottling_process/). So I thought it would be fun to do a blind side-by-side of two different bottles, one being a standard bottle and one being a K&L pick that is 11yr 6mo old.

*****

**(1) Eagle Rare, 45%**

**Nose:** Sharp and tannic oak with a metallic twang, vanilla, sweet orange zest, herbal menthol, chocolate

**Taste:** Sweet corn, smooth toasted oak, brown sugar, vanilla, vibrant spice, slight tannic bitterness.

**Finish:**sweet corn and minty spice with clean toasted oak and vanilla

*****

**(2) Eagle Rare, 45%**

**Nose:** Big toasted oak that is softer and warmer, rich chocolate, warm orange zest, vanilla, leather, some light menthol

**Taste:** Sweet corn, brown sugar, smooth toasted wood, vanilla, chocolate, leather

**Finish:** Kind of mellow and even-tempered, it continues sweet and richly smooth with darkly toasted oak, chocolate, and vanilla

*****

Score: 

(1) **6.5**

(2) **6**

These are both delicious and drinkable Whiskies, sweet, toasted and oaky. At first (2) was the clear winner for me, it was a little richer and fuller with more of a toasted flavor and less tannic bitterness. It has a nice smooth chocolatey oakiness that I really enjoy. But as I drank I started to appreciate (1) more. It has more vibrant flavors and complexity, and a nice herbal spice to it. Unfortunately they both taste a little thin and watered down, but it's a minor complaint for a cheaper 45% bottle. I think I may just be addicted to Barrel Proof Bourbon at this point.

Reveal: [(1)K&L pick, (2)standard bottle](/spoiler)

I really love that a random bottle can compete so closely with an 11.5 yr pick from a store with such a good reputation, tells me there's delicious Eagle Rare to be had all over. Feels like it mostly boiled down to personal preference between the 2, although the finish was much better on the K&L pick. But I have seen some people around here complain about bottle variation and bad bottles of Eagle Rare, so a store pick might still be a safer bet. All the ones I've had have been delicious, a great value bottle.

I find Eagle Rare to have the best single barrel variation for store picks. By that I mean: they are never worse than the standard bottling, but they are often different and offer a unique experience. I've never regretted buying one. 
Nice review. That K&L pick seems to sell out immediately. I enjoyed the sample that you sent me.

btw, those are Big pours for sbs review. :)
Great idea for a review. Nicely done. They are all pretty much Single Barrel. I‚Äôve had good bottles both ways.  
Yeah I always seem to enjoy all the ER store picks I've had. I prefer pouring the full 2oz for a review, and I guess I figured since this isn't cask strength might as well make it 2 pours!
Thanks man. It was fun, I really enjoy doing side by side tastings. "

**Taste:** Caramel, clean peat, sweet vanilla, Green apple, sharp crisp wood and light chocolate

**Finish:** Ashy peat and wood char, lots of sweet caramel and vanilla

I'm just gonna say what I was thinking as I drank this, it reminds me a lot of Ledaig 10. It has a little more char and ash than I remember from Ledaig though. But it has that same strong Islay style nose that ends up being more gentle, sweet, and complex on the palate. I'm gonna say 46-48% and just stick with that as a guess. Real curious about this one though.

Fast forward a few months and u/nsquare14, who I got the sample from initially, was nice enough to send me some more so I could give it a proper tasting. A big thank you for the second chance man!

*****

**Amrut Greedy Angels, 8yr, 50%**

**Nose:** Orange and citrus, burnt brown sugar, caramel, warm malt, woody funk, mild spice. Dark and mysterious, interesting notes.

**Taste:** Burnt brown sugar, sweet rich caramel, orange zest, mild spice, sharp red wine sweetness

**Finish:** Delicious slow burn of rich caramel malt, burnt brown sugar, orange and spice

*****

My taste was definitely off before, this is really good. It has a dark, mysterious and burnt quality to it, but it's sweet and malty at the same time. And the warm, mild spice plays nicely with the richer flavors. The word ""interesting"" keeps popping to mind as I drink this, it has a neat interplay of flavors that make it unique and enjoyable. And the most amazing part is reminding myself it's only 8 years old, the complexity and rich flavor this achieves is pretty impressive. All that being said, it's tasty but it's not mind blowing. I think I enjoyed the Kadhambam more which goes for a LOT less money, and was even more unique and interesting to me. I'm pretty impressed with this distillery in general though.

*****

A beautiful malty Scotch that's on the sweet side. There's lots of sweet and fruity flavor that keep it from being a straight up ""malt bomb"" though, and it works wonderfully. Flavors flow very nicely, being sweet and rich and malty without going overboard in any one direction. It's just delicious and pleasant from start to finish. I'm gonna score this pretty high because I'm a sucker for a well-executed malty Scotch, which seems like it's a harder thing to accomplish than you'd think, and this does it quite well.

Coworkers don't know how coolers work,,https://i.redd.it/8bqwykxn20i01.jpg,"this is the maddest I've ever been at a thing on this subreddit. 
And fuck that person who brought the obscenely large blue cooler. 
Ugh, this is a thing at my work too.
I think the coolers are for ""don't steal my lunch""
this is just being lazy af.
Wtf are they keeping in them? Live organs?
First, this is annoying because they can simply leave their cooler (with ice packs) at their desk and their food will still be plenty cold by lunch time. 

Second, and even worse, is that they're too lazy to take the food out of the cooler before putting in the fridge. If it really needs to be in the break-room until lunch, leave the cooler on a counter? Idk. This just really bugs me. 
They know, they just don't care about the space they're using.
downvoted op because this is r/mildlyinfuriating not r/reallyinfuriating

Savages! 
The fridge will extract heat through the cooler's insulation, but slowly. It's better than leaving them in the sun.
This is the same situation at my work!

One of those lunchbags is even identical to the one I own! Yet I understand how the bag functions and it sits happily on the counter out of the way.
I fucking *hate* this!
This is more mildly stupid than mildly infuriating
You know what's great? The outsides of those coolers are dirty AF, which means so is the inside of that fridge.
bahahaha
I hate this. Unless you literally have a 2-hour commute in 85+ temperatures, your sandwich will survive the trip from your house to the office unrefrigerated.
Right? I'm glad you guys understand 
When the clock strikes 5 and he pulls out some cold ones for the boys you‚Äôll regret saying that.
It's a production plant, so not many desk jobs but there's plenty of space in the break room to keep the stuff. They just kind if mindlessly do it without thinking. Honestly it's not a huge problem 90% of the time, until you go to throw something in there and then you're mildly infuriated.
My favorite comment so far
Please tell me yours isn't the one that looks like a purse in the upper left. He still gets shit about that. 
I've packed a sandwich pretty much everyday for the last 5 years. Never have I refrigerated said sandwich. I survived just fine. I'm more afraid of what germs live in our office fridge (that the janitor probably cleans with the same mop he uses for the bathroom stalls).
No you misunderstood, he means *fuck* them, appreciatively. 
That part makes sense about not many desk jobs; but still, it's mildly infuriating just looking at it, not sure how I'd feel about having to actually deal with that on a daily basis. 
Lol, nope! I'm the bottom right light blue type! The purse guy at my company ""manned up"" (his words, not mine) and started carrying his lunch in a fabric toolbag.
I have a cooler of my own to where I don't even use the fridge, and yes I actually keep an ice pack in it if I want to keep my food cold. It's more annoying just seeing it all the time. "

**Taste:** Sweet brown sugar, sharp and tannic toasted wood, nutty grittiness, chocolate, light cherry sweetness. 

**Finish:** Sweet and mellow with nutty funk and light tannic wood.

I really enjoyed this pour. And it doesn't really taste ""overly oaked"" to me as I often hear, I feel like the ECBP I've had is way oakier(not complaining!). It's a little thin at 45%, but it's delicious for what it is. The tannic and earthy wood plays really well with the sweetness, it's an enjoyable sipper for sure. What this immediately reminds me of as a Scotch fan is some of the higher end Johnnie Walkers I've had, it's delicious and I'll gladly drink it and enjoy it but I'm not gonna pay top dollar for a bottle.

Love this stuff. While my general preference is for barrel proofers, there are plenty of nights when I'm not looking for that kick in the mouth. On those nights, this hits the spot almost perfectly. It could use a bigger finish and if you don't like a sweet profile it's not for you, but otherwise it's pretty great. 
Happy you liked this one as much as I do. To me it's definitely borderline over-oaked, and it's lacking a little on the proof, but it's a solid easy drinking oak bomb. Great for my friends that like the oak profile but can't stand the heat of the ECBP just yet.
I think that between the price and and the way some sleazy liquor stores try to sell it to me like it's the best Bourbon known to man, I kind of went in biased against it. But I really enjoyed it, it's genuinely delicious.
Yeah, I could see this being a pretty amazing Bourbon for beginners or people who maybe don't enjoy barrel proofers. And it's got a lot more going for it than just being ""smooth."" "

*****

**Mystery Sample 1**

**Nose:** Bitter orange and caramel, musty wood, chocolate, cherry syrup. Sweet and tannic

**Taste:** Thick orange and brown sugar, stale wood, some light spice, and interesting kind of buttery creaminess, sweet cherry

**Finish:** Spicy corn, sweet hot cherry and cinnamon

**Thoughts:**When I first poured this I had it pegged as a FRPS from the nose, it had that strong wood and syrupy sweet cherry. But it kind of dulled and flattened out as it opened up, and a FRPS this is not. It's not bad and there's really nothing off-putting about it; it's enjoyable with some good flavor, but it just kind of lands with a thud instead of a bang. Real middle of the road, tasty and drinkable but not amazing. It drinks in a respectable 45-50% range. Nothing jumps to mind as far as what this reminds me of, so maybe Bulleit Bourbon?

*****

**Mystery Sample 2**

**Nose:** First impression, this is a spicy Rye. Sharp, crisp Rye spice and lots of toasted oak. Vanilla, brown sugar, rich berries, minty spice.

**Taste:** This is beautiful and it's cask strength. A rich, dark explosion of strong cinnamon and Rye, vanilla, burnt brown sugar, gingerbread baking spices, smooth toasted wood, dark berry sweetness.

**Finish:** Super spicy Rye and huge cinnamon tingle with tons of clean, toasted oak. Leaves with a perfect chocolatey char and Rye spice

**Thoughts:**This is fucking delicious, it has all the best parts of rich, toasted barrel notes along with all the best parts of bright, spicy and minty Rye. It's a cask strength but I don't think it's some insanely high proof, more like a very drinkable mid-50%. I really hope this is actually a Rye and I'm not embarrassing myself too much here. It doesn't taste like an MGP Rye to me which kind of leaves me with a WhistlePig SiB. That doesn't quite feel right for this either, but their barrels can vary a lot from what I've tried so I'll stick with that for a guess.

These were pretty fun. I've never heard of Oola distillery or [this Bourbon](https://www.ooladistillery.com/spirit/cask-strength-waitsburg-bourbon-whiskey/), but I liked it. It's very drinkable at 58%, it's tasty although it doesn't quite pop with as much flavor or big mouthfeel as I would expect from a full on Barrel Proofer. I guess I'm saying it's very smooth. If the price isn't too bad it would be a decent buy to support a local distillery. Especially since they are actually making their own spirit and not just sourcing.

I'm pretty surprised by the FRPS, but it's good to know one of my absolute favorite Bourbons still scores so well in a blind tasting, even if I was way off. This tasted straight up like a Rye Whiskey, an extra oaky and spicy one though. A really delicious Private Select.

Loved these mysteries.  It‚Äôs nice that a 4R can still come across as rye now and then, and score well. 
Thanks, and yeah they're a hoot. Even when you guess wrong, the experience of drinking something blind with no bias or preconceptions is a lot of fun.
I've never had a FRPS that reminded me so much of a rye. This one was a world of difference from the only other obsv I had, which was dark and rich and kind of closed."

**Nose:** Rich caramel and brown sugar, toffee, corn grain, funky wood, rye herbalness, leather

**Finish:** Dry and spicy, woody caramel with a firework finale of cinnamon and rye spice kick

**2010 Wild Turkey 101 8yr export, 50.5%**

**Color:** [1.5](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg)

**Nose:** Caramel and rich chocolate, vanilla, sweet berry fruitiness, warm/muted cinnamon

**Taste:** Sweet caramel and orange, beautiful toasted wood, warm cinnamon

**Finish:** A long, beautiful finish that takes it's time, building big and sweet with smooth caramel and bright berry/orange fruitiness

*****

These were both delicious and had noticeably different characters, a lot of fun to drink side by side. The standard 101 is a nice combination of brash corn sweetness, rich caramel, and some spicy kick, with some delicious funk thrown in for good measure. It kind of covers all the Bourbon bases nicely for me. It's exactly the kind of corny and spicy flavor profile I imagine when I think of ""Bourbon."" The 8yr is both richer and sweeter to me. There's more chocolate and vanilla, less herbal notes and the cinnamon spice feels very warm and smooth. But at the same time it has this bright, fruity element that almost reminds me of a wine finish in scotch. The standard 101 has a head-on attack kind of feel, it gives you a nice warm kick and lets you know you're drinking Bourbon. The 8yr kind of flows, the flavors unroll at their own pace and you're along for the journey.

All in all the 8yr wins for me, but not by a lot. It's the finish that clenches it, otherwise I would say these are both just different beasts with their own strengths. The standard 101 ""pops"" kind of quickly with a spicy kick. The 8yr has a more complex and long lasting finish that starts rich and builds bright. I'll gladly drink either one though.

Great reviews!  These 2010 8yr 101s came up on finedrams once and I got 3 and have enjoyed them. They are on par with WTKS imo and are a bit more interesting for being age stated. I also have found a number of older NAS 101s (2000-2006) and I think they are totally different from these 8yr export bottles and from the current 101. 
Great one. It a great news that the younger stuff is still solid. I‚Äôm used to the 8yo but it‚Äôs getting harder and harder to get, so I‚Äôm gonna switch to the 101 NAS soon. Thx for the heads up. 
I too have that poster!
Great review buddy and interesting side by side. Agree on the finish its really good. Haven't had the standard 101 since ages, need to revisit it and do the same sbs. 
This.
It's cool that the 8yr ~~is~~ was that readily available over there, where it could be a fixture for you. But yeah, the 101 is a delicious Bourbon. It's just a little different is all, a little spicier with more kick imo.
I did a blind SBS recently with the 8 and 12. I liked the 8 more. 
sounds good to me.
I had a 1999 12yr, and it was good...but kinda boring. No spice or funk, just really rich and smooth. So I could see that, although I probably still enjoyed it more than this 8yr."
Ideas for pulling a bronze bushing,,https://i.redd.it/q4lh5qnzklg01.jpg,"Pack the hole with grease or bread or even wet toilet paper, then take a close fitting shaft, stick in the hole and hammer it in. Add more goo and repeat as needed. The goo should get behind the bushing and push it out.
If you're on patreon, the mister himself just posted a vidjeo about welding out a blind bronze bushing!
Just found this sub, hope I'm doing this right. So this is a front plate off a pump, and it houses the bronze bushings for the 2 shafts. They press-fit into a blind hole with no opening on the other side, so I can't just press it back out. I have a puller meant for this situation, it goes in past the bushing and expands, and is then supposed to pull the bushing out. But all I can get it to do is carve up the back end of the bushing before slipping out. My strategy has always been to just get a sawzall and cut the bushing into 2 pieces until it falls out. This is kind of time consuming and not very much fun, plus I end up cutting into the housing a bit which I don't love. Thought I'd post here to see if there's any better ideas, or even if someone could link me to a better puller. The bushing is 3.5"" long, 1.75"" od, and 1.43"" id(a little more on a worn out bushing). I'm pretty sure it's bronze but it might be brass if that makes a difference. Thanks!
All else fails hammer and a chisel! 
Yeah that idea did occur to me like removing a clutch bearing, but I never actually tried it. I kind of figured a 3.5"" long press fit bushing would be too much friction for the method to overcome. It's a slow day though, maybe I'll give it a go. Thanks!
[deleted]
If you are replacing the bushing just give it a couple weld tacks with a mig gun. Go have a coffee. Turn the housing upside down and the bushings will fall out.

Can you get your hands on liquid nitrogen? It should contract the bushing more than the surrounding metal.
So, I‚Äôve done similar bushings on much larger shit that is heatable.  We‚Äôd basically heat the shit out of the bushing with a torch so that the surrounding metal also took in some heat.  Once that has all expanded, the bushing cools a lot faster and literally drops out.  Sometimes a couple taps are needed, but I‚Äôm trying to say that a torch is your friend.

Someone suggested welding the bushing, which does more or less the same thing.
Not sure if we're supposed to link the early access patreon videos.
Will the mig tack on brass/bronze? I've honestly never tried.
We have large canisters and cylinders of nitrogen, but no I don't think I can get liquid out of them. We're supposed to transition to one single large storage tank soon instead of multiple loose canisters, not sure how all that is gonna work though.
Thanks, I will definitely try that.
Oh, yeah good call. Might piss somebody off. Thanks for the heads up.
I don‚Äôt think Uncle B would mind in this case.
Yes.
Im not sure if you understand liquid nitrogen. 
The heat also helps get rid of any corrosion between surfaces, like rust or whatnot.  Alternately dry ice is the best bet for shrinking it out, but everyone has torches and dry ice isn‚Äôt super easy to get if you don‚Äôt have a supplier.
Someone oughta bring down the ban hammer on you.
I'm quite sure that I don't haha. I think the cylinders are liquid nitrogen, but when you open the valve gas comes out. I dunno how it works, I'm just a mechanic!
Yeah I hear you, I've certainly used heat before on siezed bolts and parts, just didn't think it would do much for a bushing. And these are the only equipment we have with blind press-fit bushings like this, so I don't have to deal with them much. Luckily this is a spare part, so I have time to fuck around with it. I will try this next week, and knowing me I'll pry report back.
Meh. superUnknown4's got a nice ring to it.
It boils at -320¬∞F...
Liquid nitrogen is not safe to handle if you don't know what you're doing, but most grocery stores sell dry ice that will do nearly the same thing. 
Please do!"

**Bruichladdich Black Arts 3, 48.7%**

**Color:** [1.7](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg), I don't normally mention color but this might be the darkest Scotch I've ever had, I'm drooling already.

**Nose:** Huge caramel and malt with equally huge dark, musty fruitiness. Grapes, dry sherry, fruity fudge, orange, tart berries, I can just keep going on and on

**Taste:** Thick, fudgey fruit, smooth caramel and malt, soft wine funk, strawberry, brine, dry berry tartness, pepper, vanilla

**Finish:** Explodes with sweet berry and fruit, then smooths out for a long, rich finish of vanilla, thick caramel maltiness, and Fudgey fruit. Leaves with a nice peppery tingle.

*****

Everything about this is massively huge yet smooth and warm, it's the ultimate gentle giant of Scotches. I keep using the words Fudgey Fruit to describe this, I've never heard that term before but it's all I can think of when sipping this. It's so thick and fudgey rich. And I've used the word ""fruity"" describing Scotch before, but I feel like I misspoke until now-THIS is fruity. It's saturated with a warm, embracing fruitiness that doesn't overwhelm like some sherry bombs I've had, while at the same time letting malt and other interesting flavors shine through beautifully. It's complex, but in a huge, effortless and flowing way. Words are failing me here, I'll just say it's fucking delicious. I might have sought this out if I had sampled it when it was available, but the price may have stopped me. $300 would be a tough decision, and any more than that would probably be a pass even for one of the best Scotches I've ever had. That's easy to say when I can't get it anymore though, so who knows.

"Review #8, Nikka Coffey Grain",,https://i.redd.it/6tlrwsz9cwf01.jpg,"This is a grain Whisky distilled mostly from corn from what I understand, and in a distinct style of still called a Coffey still. Hence the name. Sample courtesy of u/nteagle, from a swap that goes back a ways.

*****

**Nikka Coffey Grain, 45%**

**Nose:** Sticky caramel, brown sugar, corn grain, musty wood. It hits a lot of Bourbony notes but has a Scotch like mellowness.

**Taste:** Brown sugar, sweet caramel, vanilla cream, orange, light toffee,

**Finish:** Nothing big, just kind of carries on light and sweet, leaves with cinnamon, light toffee and some bitter wood

*****

This sample has been sitting on my shelf for a while, I never really looked into it and just figured it for another average-proofed Japanese Whisky. This is actually more interesting than that though, being Japanese grain. It feels like Japans version of a Bourbon, similar to how Balcones puts an American spin on Scotch. It hits many Bourbon notes of corn sweetness and richer barrel notes, but still maintains a very elegant, refined character. The only real downside for me is the finish, which leaves with an unpleasant bitterness. Normally I wouldn't fault an overall good experience too much for a little drawback, but the finish is bitter enough to subtract a point I think. Still a fun dram and a pretty interesting experience.

No joke, you have been sitting on this one for a while! Nice job on the review. I have to agree, this does drink a lot like a Japanese riff on a bourbon. Glad to see you you enjoyed it!
I've been tackling older samples lately, and a few of them have been pleasant surprises like this one. This was from our 2nd swap, my 21st, in Oct 2016.
I didn't realize it had been *that* long. It's always cool when you run across something that punches above your expectations. "
"Review #36, Bulleit Bourbon 10yr",,https://i.redd.it/8xw50r9gpff01.jpg,"Sample courtesy of u/mdonner1175, it's an older sample from our first swap over a year ago

*****

**Bulleit Bourbon 10yr, 45%**

**Nose:** Maple, burnt caramel, orange, rich musty wood, vanilla

**Taste:** Burnt caramel and dark cherry, a little spicy, then calms down into sweet vanilla and smooth deeply toasted oak

**Finish:** Brighter orange and caramel with more of that beautiful smooth toasted wood.

*****

Holy shit this is goddamn delicious. This sample has been sitting on my shelf for over a year because I just kept reaching for other ones that seemed more exciting. Now I feel like I've been missing out. It's a swell mix of smooth toasted oak goodness and rich sweetness, and it's ridiculously drinkable. I think this is going to be the bottle I take to my next party or family camping trip, definitely tastes like a crowd pleaser.

About a month ago I went by Walmart to pick up a bottle of wt101 and saw a row of this 10 year Bulleit on clearance for $28 normally around $50

I had never tried it before but figured the savings alone Justified two bottles.  When the checker scanned the bottles they rang up at $18! She said they had been reduced again yesterday. I considered going back for a few more, Jesus regular Bulleit is usually around $22 but the lines were crazy and I was eager to plop down on the couch with a glass after a long work week.

When I got home I poured a generous splash over a single rock and I have to say it was delicious. Before I knew it half the first bottle was gone, easily one of my all time favorites. I found this bourbon to be much more complex than the standard Bulleit that usually ends up mixed in an Old Fashioned.  It had great wood and spice notes with a relatively smooth finish.

Ps around 9am the next morning bet your buns I was back at that Walmart and after checking with an employee to make sure there was no additional back stock I snagged the remaining 4 bottles 

Would I pay $50+ for it when I run out? No, I think there are better bourbons out there in the $50-60 range.  But if given the chance again at around $20 even at $30 I would buy out the shelf.
Thanks for the review. I should pick up a bottle of this. I have had a few bottles of Bulleit barrel proof and I really like this one. 
Nice, what a lucky find. I might have done the same in your situation. I checked and I can get it for about $40, which is kind of an ""on the fence"" middle ground for me between ""a bit too much"" and ""not *too* expensive."""
What a shaft key shouldn't look like,,https://i.redd.it/wkvi0gyzl7f01.jpg,"Is that a hand-operated wheel?... How?
In my mind that's a key that did it's job, or you'd have a broken shaft or other dilemma. Although, the keyway looks twisted, so I dunno.
how stir welding starts...
And to think people pay money for things like [that](https://928motorsports.com/parts/Images/Offset_Keys/OKeys1.jpg)!
Well, the pulley isn't coming off the shaft accidentally. We can be sure of that.

[The company I work for fixed a similar problem](https://imgur.com/gallery/ThYl0) but the motor never stopped turning until that broke free and someone heard the noise.
Shear power!
And now they are one. 
I got a free lawnmower that wouldn't start, popped the upper cover off and that's about what it looked like. 
Why wasn't there torque overload fault built into the control system?  Any decent VFD or motor controller would overload, fault out and require a reset before this would happen. 
te shaft shouldn't look like that, either.
What was the HP and voltage/amps on that?  Worm drive I'm assuming?  If so, what was the reduction?
Yep that guys got some muscle on it. Makes sense.  Turned that key way into a real nice impromptu broach. Have you considered posting this on r/skookum?
Someone posted this on a Facebook Suzuki GS owners' group last week. I think his keyway probably had looked similar to this before someone got the welder out https://imgur.com/a/oEtcD
Busy out that cape and make a new one. 
Did its job.
Hey at least it has a key.  \#stillabetterdesignthanford
Is the shaft twisted too, or is cut diagonally?
It couples a pump to motor/speed reducer gearbox. Something got stuck in the pump while it was running, and this was the weak point.
Yeah the shaft, key and coupler are all fucked in this situation. It's off a pump, if there's any bright side it's that this broke instead of something internal.
No, the key failed to do its job.  It should have sheared off. The keyway and shaft should be unaffected. 
Yeah, in this case the key should have sheered IMO, but it doesn't look like it did. Shaft got the shaft.
They key fucked its self up and the shaft.  Definitely didn't do its job. 
Timing adjusted keys?

Is that duct tape? 
It did trip the overload and blow a fuse. But the overload doesn't trip until the pump suddenly stops and the amps spike on the motor right? The damage is done by then.
It's a 480v 3ph,15hp motor, not sure about the exact reduction but it's a 1750rpm motor and it steps it down to probably about 100rpm on the pump. Blew a 30 amp fuse

you would think someone designing this, knowing this is the weak point might make a shear pin or something in place. I always thought those designs were pretty smart, serviceability wise at least.
Ah, that makes more sense.

At a quick glance, it looked like a milling machine axis wheel or something.
Izzat a Ringfeder coupler?
Is there not a spider coupling on the shaft somewhere?
In my experience a sheared key always ruins the shaft. It either drags sheared metal around the shaft milling it down, or just wedges itself stuck and rounds out the key channel.
I wasn't sure if it was the angle of the pic, so in retrospect, key failed maybe because of using the wrong material.
>  It should have sheared off. The keyway and shaft should be unaffected. 

Haha, no. Shafts get fucked when the key sheers. 
It should have been a brittle failure though. Keys are supposed to be designed to shear, not mush. 
Design flaw or assemblers error. If they wanted the key to be the planned point of failure they shouldve used a much softer metal than the shaft or hub are made of.

You'll see a planned point of failure in a lot of worm gear drives. They'll make the helical gear out of brass and the worm out of stainless. This way if the bearing on the helical gear fails the worm eats the gear instead of the other way around 
Yup! Flip them one way to retard, the other way to advance.
No, that's whats left of the pump shaft.

I used to have a picture of the other side of this but I can't find it. Somehow the pump locked up and the motor kept spinning until the shaft got really hot and really weak, then the coupling broke and it got flung across the pump room. 
Gotcha. I've dealt with quite a few low torque packaging conveyors and a decent amount of product pumps, and just never seen or heard of a key shearing this spectacularly. My respect to ya for having to disassemble and rebuild that setup. Don't look too fun at all. 
I‚Äôm a mechanic in the chemical industry. 

The last thing you want is the key, the first is supposed to be hub/coupling coming apart. Most of the machines I work with are built to fail mechanically before it fails and jumps off the skid and kills someone. 
In retrospect this looks to have ended pretty well.  You're right, the shaft could've been saved if a shear pin had let go rather than the Woodruff key.
When the key sheers it fucks the shaft up too, so no that's not a good idea. They do make replaceable couplers that sheer though. 
No, you put a strainer before the pump to keep debris from getting in.
Lovejoy 9s, 1 1/4""
Yeah, I've never even heard of a key being meant to shear off, it's just a form of quick-disconnect afaik.  That being said, I've also never seen one do this shit either lol.  I agree with you that a sheared key should ruin the surfaces of one/both parts. 
A sheared key also means more than likely the shaft is bent now, it‚Äôs unbalanced, and had metal dragged on it. 
""should""
[deleted]
Every single time no matter what ahah. Just weld it up and be on your way.
Honestly the clearance between the shaft and the keyway looks a bit big to my eyes. It might be the reason the key rotated out instead. Its also quite possible the key did shear but got snagged after a couple of rotations. 
I thought that was what I was looking at, Thanks.
Wow, that's a pretty good one
Keys shear all the time especially in applications with a really high reduction. It doesn't take much to crash a pusher conveyor or jam one roller on a roller conveyor.
yeah, Shear pins are a mechanical failure point. As well in this instance its a pump to a gearbox, so I wouldn't think anything is going flying out from a pin shearing.
The coupling is still supposed to fail before the key. 
key seats are a designed to have a certain depth and length so it fails before wrecking the shaft. It never does but thats how its supposed to work.
That sounds pretty cool, we don't have equipment to remachine a shaft or keyway though. Besides, I've found that whenever a key fully shears from a violent impact I can't even get the coupler off again in our 20 ton press. This was only a 1 1/4"" shaft, and I don't even bother trying to repair them anymore, I just rebuild with a new shaft and coupler.

I thought this was pretty cool too, that's why I posted it haha. I've seen keys sheer or roll over really bad but I don't think I've seen many like this.
Totally true about it possibly rotating and shearing. As for the fit looking loose it looks that way because the back of the key is tapered slightly to allow for easier assembly/disassembly, looks about the same fit that you see on stuff like burkle conveyors. Without a ""biopsy"" its hard to tell exactly what happened here. Most of my experience in this department is industrial, so for me the key is almost always ss as well as the shaft, and its being driven by one of those worm drives with the brass helical gear I was talking about before. I'm actually very interested to see a breakdown of the system this shaft was used in, wondering if there was a planned failure point in it other than possibly the key.
Depends if it‚Äôs a slip or interference fit hub. But you wouldn‚Äôt install a shear pin because the coupling is designed too fail before anything else. We have some gear boxes with shear pins and we have to replace them every one or two months reactively. Unfortunately when they break, we have to shut an entire train down losing 33% of production until it‚Äôs replaced. Shear pins can fail too easily. Maybe it‚Äôs just a design flaw on that system. 
I meant to say the last thing you want to fail is the key. I expanded on that in my next comment. 
Unless it was repaired, in which case who knows what kind of key was stuck in there. The craziest thing I've seen is a piece of hss tool steel. 1/4 "" tool blanks can also be keys in a pinch I guess. 
That's a fair point. I just would've thought shear pins would be better than this type of failure.
I had a manager ask about this once. 110 production lines, with about 35 running beyond the manufacturer's spec. A shear pin on those 35 broke about once a week, creating about 5 machine stops a day requiring replacement of a shear pin.

The drive shaft turned a gearbox driving a cambox turning 5128 control pins. The drive shafts are machined in Italy and about five are stocked stateside.

""Why don't we use a grade 8 bolt on it?""

""Why don't you stay in the front office and stop making dumb suggestions? If you mean 'What can we do to reduce downtime' just ask that. If your idiot friend in R&D hadn't malformed the product spec we wouldn't be here running motors over load and breaking shear pins. Can you fit a ten foot drive shaft in checked luggage returning from Italy? In the meantime sign this PO for 300 $2 shear pins please.""
the conveyor line that utilized more keyed shafts than any other machine at my old job was notorious for breaking down. luckily it only used two different sized keys, so the operations foreman had a huge stash of both sizes should one ever get borked or magically go missing. 
Key stock and a bandsaw, followed by a sander or pedestal grinder. That‚Äôs how my shop deals with keys. 
> bandsaw

LOL as if the maintenance department (i.e. me myself and i) were allowed to make such grand purchases on tools. It couldnt be worked into the budget (neither could the 30 year old restored bridgeport knee mill i wanted to grab for 800 bucks, or the restored bench lathe for 750, or even a fucking bottle of argon for the mig welder), but the company had more than enough spare funds to install over 100 HD 360* zoomable security cameras complete with in house server for web access so the owner and facility head could make sure no one was taking water breaks or piss breaks on the job while they were in vegas at ""trade shows""



one of the many reasons i left that place and havent looked back. word to the wise, when they tell you they will provide you with tools, and litterally everything comes from harbor freight with the operations foreman telling you 
""i got you some quality stuff"", take your next paycheck and run like hell.
I‚Äôm probably spoiled then as I‚Äôm a machinist with a a full manual and cnc shop available to work with. 
this place was plywood importer and custom machining shop. had a few beastly northwood routers with pcd and solid carbide tooling on them. facility manager threatened to fire the senior programmer because he wanted to cut 1/8"" aluminum on the oldest one to make a replacement mount for the one drill block, had an absolute fit and swore that the router and tools couldnt handle it despite the fact that the programmer offered to bring in his own tooling for the job. 
That seems unlikely. I mean I‚Äôd have to see the tooling, but 1/8 aluminum is just butter.
Yup and the Northwoods are the size of fucking school buses and have 22hp liquid cooled spindles on them. Would've been a fucking joke. Hell my friends shapeoko tabletop cnc 3 axis that uses a dewault hand router can handle that no problem.

As for the tooling; he was gonna bring in a few shear hog endmills. "

**Finish:** Smoother caramel and chocolate rides out into the finish with more brash cherry cough syrup, leaves kind of bitter.

Not horrible, but I sure wish the flavor could live up to the awesome nose. It's kind of a rolllercoaster that goes all over the place, it explodes quickly with some unpleasant bitter and tinny flavors but there's some nicer rich flavors too. Leaves a metallic, bitter taste in my mouth though. Complex in all the wrong ways lol.

Sorry that you didn't like it better, but I agree with the tinny note on the palate and a bit too much bitterness on the finish. It is a pretty fresh bottle, so I'm hoping you're right about it airing off some.
You said you were especially sensitive to bitter notes, so I was curious what you thought of it. Wondering if maybe I was being too hard on it because it's not awful, but it has some unpleasant notes for sure. That nose is delicious though!
I was about to get really excited since I have family that lives in HyVee land.  Do you know which warehouse this one came from?
Nope, it's got a bit of an off-putting note. I actually wasn't sure if it was just me or not :p
As someone who has spent their life in HyVee land...there's a reason I passed on a RRSiB of theirs given the chance.

**Balvenie 15 Single Barrel Bourbon Cask, 47.8%, distilled 4/26/96, bottled 2/7/12**

**Nose:** Not the light and sweet Scotch I was expecting. Richer toffee and caramel, lemon, pastry, malt, chocolate, a little peppery

**Taste:** The flavor flows smoothly and sweetly, caramel and chocolate, rich maltiness, honey and lemon zest, the faintest spice

**Finish:** bright finish of sweet caramel and pastry, then it finishes kind of peppery and spicy, gives it a happy little kick

*****

This was thicker and richer than I was expecting based on my previous experience with Balvenie. Even the 12yr SiB which has the same ABV tends to have a lighter, weaker mouthfeel to me. The sweeter flavors and malt flows together nicely with the richer Bourbon barrel notes, and overall it's well balanced but maybe a little too even-tempered. Personally I prefer the maltiness and brighter fruit to ""pop"" a little more, but this is still delicious. Definitely better than any of the 12yr SiB's I've tried.

I haven't tried TUN series, so this is still my favorite Balvenie release. Down to my last bottle of it. 
The 15yr sherry barrel I had I liked as much or more than this, which is weird because I'm usually not so big on sherry.
Its exactly opposite for me. I like sherried whisky and if I choose a bourbon cask matured whisky, then I prefer it to be peated. But for some reason, I liked this a lot.

The 15yr sherry cask is also good, but there are better options available at similar price."

**Nose:** Super rich caramel and huge, thick pastry malt, with perfectly toasted vanilla. It's rich and sweet, like marshmallow and cake frosting. it also has a floral, white wine sharpness to it. I already love this. 

**Taste:** Creamy explosion of sweet caramel and thick, clearly defined cereal maltiness. There's light brine too, honey, vanilla, butterscotch. It has a quality to it that is both thickly creamy and yet lightly sweet and fruity, with the caramel and malt pervading.

**Finish:** Finish is amazingly long and sweet, toasted vanilla and of course rich and grainy butterscotchy maltiness

*****

This is truly the meaning of a malt bomb. It has all the sweet, creamy and malty characteristics of a standard Bourbon Barrel Scotch but dialed up to 10. What Octomore does for peat, this does for creamy malt pastry goodness. And like an Octomore, it is impossible to just mindlessly sip this and forget what you are drinking. Every sip is an event, the sheer deliciousness demands your attention. The flavors are thick but it moves kind of nimbly on the tongue in a very pleasant way. Yum.

I love this one, too - the porridge-like thickness and the intense barley notes make me feel like I'm drinking the very essence of the grain. Cheers!

This sounds amazing. I love those rich caramel notes and cereal maltiness, with a side brine.  Springbank is putting out some really nice stuff. Great review.
>intense barley notes make me feel like I'm drinking the very essence of the grain.

Totally, it feels like a perfect showcase for the awesome maltiness. You have me wondering about the Bruichladdich Bere Barley now. I don't need another Scotch on my wishlist, but I really love Bruichladdich and The Laddie dammit. 

Thanks again for re-sending these too, I feel really lucky like I get my sample and then a whole extra ounce to enjoy. 
Haha, I was kind of tipsy when I wrote this up last night and didn't recall that particular note. I like it though! 
I passed on a bottle already actually, that price still gets me. Which is totally illogical since I'll pay the same amount for a 6yr octomore. It would be pretty tempting at $100-$120 though.

I find that the Hi Times boys just consistently pick fantastic barrels. I'll have to order one of these OBSQ's. 
I'm drinking an OBSQ right now and it hits some similar notes (with a little more herbs and buttercream. Rather than chocolate).

They're so consistent and so good: this is probably my favorite OB pick to date (Rose City Liquors), and definitely my favorite Q pick.
Never had a bad pick from Hi-Time. Those folks know what they're doing.
Can't wait to try this one, it sounds right up my alley: well aged OBSQ around 110pf. Bam!
Glad to hear you're drinking well wherever you're at :)

I'm actually just starting to explore OB's more. My first Private Select was an OESQ and still one of the best Bourbons I've ever had, and I got it in my head that I would prefer the lower Rye mashbill and went with it. But now with how good this is, I'm looking forward to trying more OB's. We should do an OB swap.
The 9year 3month ~59% abv? I just cracked my bottle open and thought its pretty darn good. I'm gonna do a review of it soon. I'm glad I'm not the only one that liked it cuz others were really not liking it
Totally agree. I can't say the same for K&L though.
I have always loved both, but have had more oe's just because they've been around more.

I'd had bad luck with Q yeast ( the other two I'd had we're both crazy hot), but this one I'm drinking tonight has nice heat that mellows from sip to swallow and just an awesome combo of richness and spice. 

They're so stinking good: even mediocre FRPS bottles are a good value.
Yeah, that's the one. I really liked it a lot...certainly a lot more than other reviews I've seen on here.

>Single Barrel does not necessarily mean it was a store pick bottle.  All Eagle Rare is picked out one barrel at a time.  We no longer call it Single Barrel only because the fill line in our high speed bottling may co-mingle the contents from more than one barrel. 

**Me:** So wait, are barrels vatted together before bottling, or are they bottled individually with the co-mingling only happening in the fill line?

>The barrels are not mingled together, they are done sequentially, one after the other, but because of the length of the fill tube, there will be some from one barrel in the tube when we dump the next one, so that is why we don‚Äôt call it single barrel, as we can‚Äôt guarantee that everything in one bottle is from a single barrel. I do believe the discuss this on our tours.

So basically, Eagle Rare is still bottled as a Single Barrel. It's just that they don't clear the lines between barrels so there's some overlap on the bottles at the beginning and end of each run. I just found it kind of interesting, so I thought I'd share.

EDIT: an older thread covering the same thing https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/414zao/is_eagle_rare_10_still_single_barrel/",https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/7u5npk/some_info_on_the_eagle_rare_bottling_process/,"Thanks for sharing. This is fairly well known, particularly because people were all up in arms when they dropped the single barrel designation. Same with the neck tag losing the age statement. I still think it's kind of a weird explanation, but whatever. 
Any standard bottle of Eagle Rare will be as unique and any store pick.


Yes this is why they dropped the single barrel labeling. But for all practical purposes, it's still a single barrel bourbon. I have also seen stores advertise it as single barrel. Probably because they are in the know... but they really shouldn't sell it that way. 
I did find this interesting - I'm always interested in information like this, over subjective ""I like this"" posts.  Thanks for sharing.
pretty sure some folks here like /u/Doneeb already know this. there were several articles that came out after ""single barrel"" was removed from the label that gave this exact explanation. one of them was even an interview with harlen wheatley that was discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/27nmg6/eagle_rare_10_no_longer_single_barrel/). chuck cowdery [also references that same article](http://chuckcowdery.blogspot.com/2014/07/label-changes-can-be-good-thing.html).

unfortunately it looks like clay has taken his blog offline but thanks to the magic of the wayback machine you can view the original article [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140705153419/http://themashnotes.com/death-eagle-rare-greatly-exaggerated/).

not knocking your post - it's probably a good refresher for some folks but this was discussed on here back when it happened.
I'm going to go out on a limb here and contradict the official Buffalo Trace person on a single but crucial point. I have no hard evidence for my claim, so readers must take it or leave it as you please.

It is absolutely false that the bottles always ship with the sticker on them and I know this from direct personal experience. I was recently in Oregon which is a liquor controlled state. OLCC is currently enforcing some draconian regulations that have been on the books for some time but not usually enforced. One of those regulations is that stores cannot place any ""identifying marks"" on bottles, even if they are store picks or single barrels. If you go bourbon shopping in Oregon, you will come across 4 Roses Single Barrel store picks that do not list the recipe. The first time I saw this I thought it was a mistake - the special pick label indicated the barrel was selected by an Oregon bourbon group, but did not have the recipe, only the description (minty etc.)

I digress. I collect Eagle Rare store picks and have about 7. I hunt them everywhere I go. When I was in Oregon I found a place that had just received an ER barrel pick from a restaurant they are affiliated with through ownership.  The bottles were crated with a description on them, but the guy would not sell me one with a sticker due to the new Oregon OLCC enforcement wave about identifying marks. I explained that I have a collection and kind of bro'd out with him, and finally he said screw it and took me near the back of the store.  He pulled a huge roll of stickers from the crate and slapped one on the bottle.  I know for a fact it was a store pick because I saw the crate manifests and watched him pull the roll of stickers from the crate.

Tl;Dr - they don't always ship with stickers pre-applied and I witnessed this first hand. You may have a store pick. 
Yep.
In my opinion ER10 is a fantastic bourbon, especially if you consider the price. Too bad moving age statements to a less prominent location is often done in preparation for dropping it completely :(
Yeah, I found an older thread with some info on it too. https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/414zao/is_eagle_rare_10_still_single_barrel/

I knew ER used to be labelled as a Single Barrel but the specifics in the email were news to me.
So do other bourbons they bottle as 'single barrel' go through the same line?
While I think that's probably a valid perspective, I'd imagine BT looks for barrels that best match the standard ER profile while bottling the regular stuff, saving the outliers for store picks. They've already admitted to taking barrels designed for one brand, and using it for another because it fit that profile better.

Granted, from what I've seen, ER has the least variation between barrels, store pick or not, so this may be a moot point. Still, when looking for a bottle I roll my dice on the store picks just in case I luck into something fun.

/u/buckydean - thanks for doing the legwork, very interesting read!
Yeah I guess that would be true, I like ER but haven't drank enough of it to really notice. But hopefully with a store pick it's got a better chance of being a really good barrel since someone selected it.
I thought maybe it was sure laziness, like how all shelf tags around here still say Elijah Craig 12.
I think all of my experience with ER has been after the SiB label change, and all my experience has been good so I guess it's no big deal, like a lot of the commenters were saying in those posts. It's good to see that there doesn't always need to be a knee-jerk reaction of ""change bad!""

All this was news to me with the email, and it's the kind of stuff I like reading about here so I thought I'd post it, thanks for the positive feedback and links. Interesting reads, especially the fact that they have plans to keep the 10yr age statement through at least 2047. I guess all in all this whole thing is kind of a non-issue, which is a good thing these days.
Proof, guess which one:

Thanks for the story. I know there's some unusual laws and rules with liquor in Oregon, so it may just be a peculiar case with that state. For a store pick in CA to not have a sticker it would take the distillery messing up on bottling and the store accepting them anyway. Who knows though. I ordered it online and never got to talk to anyone about it, but I really feel like I remember it saying it was a store pick, I wouldn't have bought it otherwise. It was back in 2016 though so not much I can do. 

I'll pry just open it and compare with a standard 10 to see what happens.
The CS rep should be able to cross reference the store to see if they or the distributor received any store picks recently.  Not having a sticker doesn't really prove anything.
 Nope. Single barrels are Bottled on a different line (blantons hall). Also, worth noting that they bottle eagle rare on both lines. So some eagle rare is still technically single barrel.
That's how I thought it was too, you put it into words better than me though thanks.
The store pick (in my opinion) has a better chance of being over oaked as the pickers tend to like the higher aged options based only on it being older. 
I dont know, I saw other Oregon picks that had it. But one thing I had never seen was the sticker roll itself, and I might add that they had gold stickers too for their Buffalo Trace pick.

I don't blame you for going with the official BT person's version, but I kind of doubt some marketing person can REALLY say it isn't a store pick because there was no sticker. I saw about 150 bottles and a huge roll of stickers that begged to differ.
From what I've heard, they don't provide the ages to the store along with the samples, to keep everyone from just cherry-picking the oldest barrels. I assume that most educated selectors would be looking for the distinctive character that comes with greater age, so help set their pick apart with the customers who actually know enough to care.
I've really liked all the store picks I've tried so far, to each their own or maybe I've just got lucky
That would be nice.  If I remember correctly, if you go down to pick a Knob Creek barrel they will face the ""money end"" of the barrel away from the pickers so they don't get hung up on age.  
I have as well, but it doesn't *always* mean better. "
"Review #33, Blanton's Straight from the Barrel",,https://i.redd.it/uiudoca56xc01.jpg,"This is the Single Barrel/ Barrel proof version of Blanton's Bourbon which is only available outside of America as an export, AFAIK. This sample came all the way from the magical land of Hawaii courtesy of u/brenttw.

*****

**Blanton's ""Straight from the Barrel,"" 63.35%**

**Nose:** Nutty, toasted oak, burnt caramel, brown sugar, herbal and spicy. A nice layer of richer leather too, very nice nose.

**Taste:** Very oaky and sweet, with lots of herbal spice. Nutty, brown sugar, burnt caramel. It tastes kind of burnt and sweet overall with a nice oaky backbone that isn't overwhelming.

**Finish:** Darkly sweet brown sugar and caramel, spicy toasted oak

*****

Everything about this is burnt and sweet and spicy, not much in the way of richer flavors. That's not a bad thing, it's just how this drinks. It has a brash, metallic quality to it, and it's sweet in a burnt, oaky kind of way. It's very interesting and exciting, which was a nice surprise since I thought the standard Blanton's was kind of boring and uneventful. Being a SiB it's hard to say how indicative this is of the brand, or how it fares against other bottles. I might buy a bottle of this if I could, depending on price.

I need this esp if unfiltered 
I had a sample of this and it could be a good barrel proof option if priced appropriately. Too bad its not sold in USA for some reason.
I have done an order from europe for 3 different barrels for my local group and one of my friends did an order for 4 different barrels and shipped to my office.  my ""fee"" is a sample of each bottle once one of the folks opens it.  they vary SO much.  some are 4/10, some 5/10, and recently had a 6/10 that was really nice (barrel 888, looking at you!)


you can easily get it shipped for about 90 + shipping, which works out to around 15/bottle if you get more than a single bottle


For $60-$80 I think it would be good, but the only time I saw it being sold in the US it was $100 which was a little more than I would pay.
I think the one you sent me is probably a 7/10 for me, but I haven't had much of it.  The sample of older juice (dumped in 2005 I think) that I got was stellar.  Like almost GTS good. 
awesome, I'll check it out.
You saw it in a store in the US?
you can easilly get it shipped for about 90 + shipping, which works out to around 15/bottle if you get more than a single bottle
the bottle i sent you is decent.  we had it side by side with my buddy's recent order, barrel 888, and holy shit it blew it away.  i will try to remember to secure a sample to send in the next box

*****

**2002 Tomatin 12 SiB, Ace Spirits pick, 1st fill Bourbon Barrel, cask 1833, 53.1%**

**Nose:** Classic rich malty Scotch, a little on the sweet side. Rich caramel malt, vanilla, chocolate, sweet frosting, slight wood funk

**Taste:** Bright and sweet caramel, big warm cereal malt, lots and lots of vanilla, a little bit of vegetal fruitiness

**Finish:** Malty goodness just keeps on giving, finishes with sweet caramel and vanilla

*****

This is as perfect of an example of a Bourbon barrel malt bomb as you can get, it's typical in all the right ways. This is probably a good example of how watering down a Scotch can ruin it too, because even at full proof this still not very huge or hot on the palate. I suspect this same Whisky at 46% or even 40%(*shudders*) would be good still, but kind of light and boring. Nothing unique or amazing here, but it's so delicious and enjoyable that I can't help but love it.

$45 when it was still available. It still haunts me I only bought one bottle. 
Nice! My home bar & shop got one of these (11 yo) a couple years back and it doesn't sell very well, even though it is quite nice, especially for the money. Good reminder that I ought to pick up another!
Holy shit! I was thinking at the right price this would be an amazing bottle, and that's even cheaper than I could have imagined. At least you got the one though!
[I got a sample of that from you in a swap actually](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScotchSwap/comments/54nccf/swap_16_with_uvertical_bog/). I remember that one being tasty too.

**Foursquare Criterion 10yr, 56%**

**Nose:** First impression is that it's very woody, but it's not aggressive or tannic. It's a smooth, rich chocolatey wood, rich rum sweetness, berries and figs

**Taste:** Winey sweetness and rum spice meld beautifully and come on very smooth and warm. Rich strawberry, caramel, and so much chocolate

**Finish:** More chocolate and rich caramel, ends hot and sweet though with some nice spice.

I kind of wish I had tried this blind, because I wouldn't know what to think of it. It drinks like a super sweet Bourbon, but has a complexity and elegance that reminds me of Scotch, and then the wine influence adds even more interesting flavors and delicious funk to this. I can definitely taste the ""Rumness"" to it too. Despite all these different competing flavors and experiences though, the end product is remarkably balanced and flowing. And that ABV is just perfect. Beautiful drink, I'm glad to have found another Rum I like.

Gotta say, I was hoping you'd like this more than the Clement, but I'm glad you enjoyed it regardless. Your notes are pretty much why I like it - it has all these different characters that are actually well-integrated. 
I easily liked this as much as the Clement, it's just such a different style it's hard to compare. I think that the Clement got me a little more excited, it was so different from what I'm used to with Whiskey. This really was delicious though. It kind of reminded me of Amrut Kadhambam, which is Indian for 'mixture' or 'combination.' It's aged in a bunch of different casks and perfectly blends a bunch of different flavors together like this does. 
Ahh, makes sense - Clement is a totally different animal whereas Criterion is very bourbon-ish. I can definitely see that coming into play."
"Reviews #31 & 32, Stagg Jr",,https://i.redd.it/exldr6xfz3c01.jpg,"great review, i have similar thoughts on this line. not as complex or good as ECBP but still pretty nice and somewhat easier to find.
A sbs review of two different Stagg jr release. I believe the 129.7 was #5 and the 131.9 is #9, not 100% sure on that though. Sometimes I mention color on a sbs, these were identical at [1.5](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg). The 131.9 proof sample is courtesy of u/ODMBitters.

*****

**(1) Stagg Jr, 131.9 proof, 65.95%**

**Nose:** Huge musty and tannic oak, leather, vanilla, chocolate, dark cherry, a little citrus and berry sweetness. Big, smooth and oaky.

**Taste:** A wave of huge oak and creamy vanilla, it's musty and slightly bitter. Cherry syrup, and has a chocolatey smoothness to it.

**Finish:** The heavy, oaky wave and dark chocolate rides out with dark cherry sweetness, fizzles out a little.

*****

**(2) Stagg Jr, 129.7 proof, 64.85%**

**Nose:** The same huge leathery oak and vanilla but less bitter, more daaark cherry and the citrus comes on a little sweeter and more tart

**Taste:** Still a wave of huge oak, but it's much more of a toasted oak and has more syrupy sweet cherry. Vanilla, Dark Caramel, chocolate.

**Finish:** Brighter than RB, builds with a dark cherry and toasted wood sweetness then finishes dark and chocolatey.

*****

Drinking these side by side, my first impression was how similar they are. After a while differences did start to show themselves, (1) has more chocolatey wood and creamy vanilla while (2) is more of a toasted wood and cherry cough syrup, it's slightly brighter except that I wouldn't really call these bright at all. Overall though, these are alike in nature: Big and OAKY with super dark cherry and a chocolatey smoothness. And I don't mean smooth like easy drinking, because these pack a huge punch similar to ECBP. But it's not as complex or punchy as ECBP and it hits you as more of a dark, rich, steady wave. It's a nice counterpoint to ECBP in that way, offers a different kind of experience while still providing that epically huge Barrel Proof goodness. Stagg jr was my first Barrel Proof Bourbon, and it kicked my love of American Whiskey up to another level. And even though I feel like I've tried some better things since then, I still think this is a solid Bourbon and I really enjoy the stuff.

The first bottle of Stagg Jr I had was Batch 1. It was just unbalanced hot fire. It took me until Batch 7 to buy another. I was pleasantly surprised at much better the later batches were. For $55-60, it‚Äôs right there with ECBP as one of my favorites in the price range.
I can find it for $90 a bottle... I doubt it is worth that price? 
Ya the store that has it has some high prices for everything but I thought that was just gouging. 
I love Stagg. It is a great choice. 
Agree with a lot of this and also your note of preferring ECBP but sometimes you just reach for the Stage Jr. Nice reviews!
I have both a ECBP and a Stagg Jr open right now, and even though I agree that ECBP is probably the better Bourbon sometimes I'm just more in the mood for the Stagg Jr. It fills that dark, rich barrel proof BT niche nicely.
That sums it up nicely.  
Nice! I absolutely love this stuff. I have a local store I can find it for $55 regularly so it has become a regular bottle on my shelf. Glad you enjoyed it!
I always hear that around here about the early batches. I have a morbid curiosity to try some
Naw, $70 tops.
Prices can vary in different areas but that sounds pretty high. Normal price should be $50-$60, but it can be kind of sought after and hard to find so sometimes it's marked up like that. I don't think it's worth that much personally.
As someone who loves this drink I second $70 as the high
I can‚Äôt find it to save my life.

"Rum noob review, Clement Rhum Agricole K&L single barrel",,https://i.redd.it/qs36r49to3c01.jpg,"Some background: I'm big into Whisk(e)y, and decided to start trying Rum in an attempt to branch out a little bit. For the most part my experiments with rum haven't been going all that well, until I tried Plantation OFTD which I loved. So I figured Cask Strength was the way to go and this is my next attempt at one, it's a Single Barrel selected by K&L Wines and aged for almost 4 years in new American oak. This is a 2oz sample courtesy of u/Ethanized

*****

**Clement Rhum Agricole Vieux, K&L Single Barrel, 62.5%**

**Nose:** The nose changes dramatically with some air time, I don't think I've ever seen(or smelled) a spirit take me through such a rollercoaster in the span of 15 minutes. It finally settles floral and delicate for a 60+% rum, and kind of perfumy. This nose could pass for a really sweet Scotch almost. Vanilla, syrupy sweet caramel, lots of sharp green apple, a fair amount of fun tannic funk. Rich chocolate develops as it airs out even longer, and a hint of peppery spice. Still very sweet and funky though overall.

**Taste:** What a unique mouthfeel, it just explodes with flavor but isn't oppressively huge or heavy handed like OFTB. It's sharp and clean, kind of spirit forward but it carries some really interesting flavors with it. Clean, refreshing menthol, sweet caramel, banana funk, and lots of crisp, bright green apple fruitiness. There's some spice to it, not sure how to describe it. Not what I would normally think of ""rum spice,"" it's more like that spice you get in some kind of Apple cinnamon holiday candle or something.

**Finish:** Refreshingly clean and vibrant, sweet caramel and sugary goodness with more crisp green apple and spice that builds very bright and long

*****

This is like no rum I've had before, it's extremely complex and feels like a very unique beast, which is the best thing you can hope for with a single barrel. It's not sickly sweet like other rums I've had, and that combination of clean sweetness and crisp green apple fruitiness is really doing it for me. I can't get over how much Green apple this has actually, and along with the menthol this is almost reminding me of a Mezcal. It almost has a little too much ethanol burn to it, but I feel like that helps carry the Mezcal-like crispness that this has and actually compliments it. This is the first rum that has really excited me and made me want more, but I'm not sure where to go from here as far as similar Rums or styles to this.

Score: Feels kind of arbitrary since it's the first rum I've enjoyed this much, but compared to other Spirits I've had I wanna say **7** or **8**

this is good shit. thoroughly enjoyed a couple bottles I bought a long time back 
Glad you liked it! I was a fan of this one as well, though it did border on being a little too harsh. I'm looking forward to seeing what you think of the Criterion!
It didn't come out that long ago did it? I actually have a bottle, at the time I was trying to branch out and it seemed interesting and not too expensive. But since I haven't really been enjoying Rum, I thought I'd give this a try before opening it. It's not like any Rum I've had, do you have any recommendations similar to this? 
I looked up that criterion and it seems like kind of a wildcard with all the crazy finishes, I'm looking forward to trying it too.
it‚Äôs super unique. aggy usually is. this bottle came out about a year or so go i‚Äôd say. let me scratch my head and think of similar things. OFTD comes to mind first 
I'm really hoping I didn't oversell it, but to me it stands head and shoulders above any other rum I've tried.
Yeah, OFTD is the other Rum I really liked but seemed a lot different from this. OFTD was a bruiser like ECBP, and the Clement was more complex and clean like a really good malty Scotch. Not in the taste, just as an analogy.
No worries, at this point my rum experiences have been so wildly different I'm not going in with any real preconceptions, I'll just see how I like it. 

Are you still looking to swap your partial bottle of the Clement as a misfit? 
yeah let me rack my brain for similarities. will ping you in the morning 
Sounds like you'd enjoy it way more than me, so sure.

"Review #41, Signatory UCF Highland Park 15",,https://i.redd.it/7q24xpprowb01.png,"Sample courtesy of u/ODMBitters

*****

**1999 Highland Park 15, Signatory UCF, 46%**

**Nose:** A creamy and robust nose. Rich caramel oak, banana maltiness, chocolate and dark fruit. Geez, it almost smells sherried it's so rich.

**Taste:** I can't believe this is only 46%, tasting blind I would have guessed 50-55%. It explodes with a bitter oaky burn, so I decided to add some water which I wouldn't normally do for a 46% Whisky. Even with the water added it's thick, creamy and oaky. Dark caramel malt, lots of chocolate, even some Bourbon type spice in there.

**Finish:** Very long finish that doesn't leave burnt and woody like I would have expected from the barrel heavy flavor. The Scotch-ness shines through in the end, rich chocolate, crisp caramel malt and green apple.

*****

This was a pretty unique Scotch. I drank it over the course of an hour, and even after sitting for 15-20 minutes the oak influence and bitterness was pretty strong. I don't think I've ever had to add water to a 46% Scotch, but that's a testament to the strong flavors found here. They must have used a barrel with a lot left to give or that still had a lot of Bourbon left in it(I know that's not how it works) because this had a lot of Bourbon barrel influence. The overly oaky nature of it turned me off a little bit at first, which is weird because I'm a big Bourbon fan. But the uniqueness was worth the price of admission alone, and eventually it opened up very nicely. And even with the water added it was still a pretty rich and full flavored Scotch.

Sounds good! Interesting to note the burn. One of my current favorites is the Archives' Orkney 15 (hp). It's bottled at something like 57% and it's like a kick to the face. It has a burn like nothing I've tasted at a similar abv. I wonder if they came from similar casks. 
Thanks for the review, this one interests me.
I have enjoyed the heck out of this bottle. Great review! Glad you enjoyed it!
Sure thing
It was a fun one, thanks man :)"
"Review #40, Glenmorangie 12 Quinta Ruban",,https://i.redd.it/1v1ebm94cya01.jpg,"Quinta Ruban is aged in standard Bourbon barrels then finished in Ruby Port casks for a total of 12 years. it is Non Chill-Filtered and no color added.

*****

**Glenmorangie 12yr Quinta Ruban, 46%**

**Nose:** Smooth chocolate and creamy malt, I'm already in love. buttercream frosting, some warm citrus and dry, mildly tart fruitiness. It has a rich and luxurious sweetness.

**Taste:** Rich Port and malt meld beautifully, milk chocolate, syrupy sweetness, dark caramel and honey, a warm berry fruitiness. 

**Finish:** Rich caramel maltiness and chocolate just keeps riding out smoothly, falls a little short but still delicious.

Very well done Port finish. The rich chocolatey wine never overpowers the delicious maltiness, and they manage to flow together beautifully as a single luxurious flavor. While I really liked Portwood and Solstice, I've found that I actually prefer a Port finish on non-peated Scotches like this. Sometimes it just seems like Peat and Port together can be kind of overpowering and monotone. Port seems to compliment malt really well though for me, certainly as good as sherry does, and this is darn good stuff.

To my taste this whisky is a little too sweet on the palate. The nose is wonderful, but when it comes to drinking there are days I just can't stand the sweetness. When the mood/setting is right, it's delicious.

*****

**Four Roses OESQ K&L pick, 8yr 7mo, 62.3%**

**Nose:** Warm, friendly and balanced nose of vanilla and cinnamon spice, rich chocolate, sweet and sugary cherry, toasted oak that isn't too overpowering.

**Taste:** Bright cherry sweetness pops and rides out beautifully with smooth caramel, cinnamon spice, yummy brown sugar and clean vanilla.

**Finish:** Sweet caramel and brown sugar, clean toasted oak and warm cinnamon spice.

*****

I wouldn't call this rich, but I wouldn't call it super bright either. It's clean and sweet, with just enough richness to round it out and cinnamon spice to keep it interesting. The cherry cough syrup and deeeep toasted oak that I tend to pick up in a lot of Private selects is here, but a little more ""leveled out"" and well integrated. It still manages to pop though with a spicy and oaky cherry zing that I love in these. Delicious bottle that I'm enjoying more and more the closer I get to the bottom.

The OBSQ was dynamite and I have yet to try a K&L OESQ pick. Your review has me curious. Nice notes!
Some OESQ love around here lately. Have you ever had an OWA pick? If so, do you see any similarities between this and an OWA SiB? 
Nice review.  Sounds like a very good but not great 4RPS.
What a *darn* shame..

^^Darn ^^Counter: ^^3760
Thanks. If you had asked me before I got about halfway through the bottle, I would have told you it's good but nothing special. But it seems to have opened up nicely and I'm enjoying this last bit a lot. If you want a funny read you can check out how they hyped up this bottle:

https://www.klwines.com/p/i?i=1318156
My very first bottle of FRPS was a HiTime OESQ, still one of my favorite bottles I've ever had so I'm always a little curious to try others. 

I have an OWA pick open right now courtesy of my secret santa, similarities don't really jump out at me. My OWA SiB is oakier than the OB, but this OESQ is still very ""action packed"" and vibrant compared to it if that makes sense. These FRPS's are just an experience.
Good bot, I'm sorry for swearing
Oh fuck, I have this bottle. And you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs because of that stupid blurb. I knew I had it I but I thought it was an OESV for some reason. I‚Äôll have to open it up soon and compare notes!
Lol. The best <distillery> barrel/cask yet! Don't miss it!

But I guess its working for them. For example, 200+ bottles of bunna-14 were sold out within couple of hours earlier today immediately after their whiskey newsletter went out.
That is a hilarious pitch. If that pitch is true, then whatever. I suppose it is ok but I personally wouldn‚Äôt want to publicly post the mistake of a master distiller regarding warehouse management in order to sell bottles that will sell anyway  (the whole ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bite the hand that feeds you‚Äù Bit).  If it isn‚Äôt true,  then that is pretty terrible. 
I was just curious because I friend of mine that loves OWA picks also specifically loves OESQ four roses picks. Then, Goldie just did a blind review of an OESQ that he rated highly and guessed to be either an OWA pick or ORVW.

Just trying to figure out the correlation between the two. 
Yeah, love to see your thoughts whenever you do
Yeah I saw that Bunna, looked delicious but price was a little steep to take the chance for me. I hate those emails, sometimes I'll spend weeks watching a bottle, then an email will go out and the entire stock is gone instantly. Missed out on the Knob Creek picks that way.
That's the thing, they'll sell anyway. I hope they wouldn't outright lie and tell a story like that, maybe something funny or different did happen there. Who knows.
Yeah, I was really curious about that oesq that goldfish reviewed too. If I recall Correctly the sample was from Mike, I wanted to hit him up for a sample but he's always so backed up on swaps lol.
I have the bottle too, the hype and blurb they attached to it was obnoxious. Really enjoyable bottle nevertheless.
Same with the Whistle Pig pick. I‚Äôm finishing up a store pick from hi-times and was planning on grabbing their first pick and bam, newsletter and gone.
 I hear you. Also, Mike may have sent that sample along time ago. Goldiegets his samples randomly pulled by his wife and I sent him some over a year ago that still have not been pulled so in all likelihood, that particular bottle is long gone.
It's aggravating, but I kind of tell myself if I wanted it bad enough I would have bought it sooner. 

What HiTime pick were you drinking? I try to keep my mouth shut around here about Hitime, I don't want to help it get as popular as K&L. But I've reeeeeeally liked the Hitime picks I've had so far. I figure this post is 2 days old so it's safe.
Yeah, I think he still has one of mine from over a year ago too.
Hah. It‚Äôs from last year so not sure if they still have the same pick. It‚Äôs the El Puerco Dulce and like with all the CS whistle pig picks it‚Äôs damn good.
Yeah I remember they had two picks for a while and that was one of them. I kept meaning to grab one but never got around to it. "
"Review #7, Amrut Kadhambam",,https://i.redd.it/gq4mkz711k901.jpg,"According to The Whisky Exchange, Kadhambam means 'mixture' or 'combination' and it is a vatting of normal and peated Amrut that started life in ex-oloroso casks before being transferred first into brandy casks, then into rum casks. I didn't actually look any of this up though until after I drank the Whisky, and I'm thankful because I might have been looking for certain flavors. Sample is courtesy of u/nsquare14.

*****

**Amrut Kadhambam, 50%**

**Nose:** Rich caramel malt and crisp green apple, chocolate, VERY pleasant funk that I'm really enjoying. Some cinnamon and spice, Winey grape sweetness. I'm loving the nose.

**Taste:** Rich delicious caramel maltiness, chocolate cream, banana funkiness. It has some faint clove and spice that flows nicely with the flavor and doesn't add too much kick or ""action."" A rich, elegant sweetness that isn't overly sweet at all. Mouthfeel is a little thin, especially for 50%, so I'm thankful it's not bottled lower. But the flavor is very ""clean"" and delicious.

**Finish:** Sweet caramel and vanilla with light clove and cinnamon. A simple, elegant finish. Very nice.

*****

There's a lot of different things going on with this Whisky and they all work together beautifully. Flavors that could easily be overpowering or jarring such as the spice or strong funk meld beautifully into the richer chocolate and caramel malt. And it has a pleasant sweetness at the same time that keeps it kind of light and drinkable but without getting overly sweet to me. After looking up the unique nature of this Whisky I guess these complex flavors here make sense, and Amrut has combined them very well. I didn't really get much peat from it, but that's not a problem for me. A lovely Whisky.

saw this today and was was really piqued. sounds interesting.
I liked this one a lot, though I found the finish much too short.  I know exactly what you mean by the banana funkiness, and it's what made me love this dram so much.  I just wish it was there and powerful on the finish also.
It is interesting, and it doesn't taste as ""exotic"" as you would think, it's rich and malty and delicious. Not sure what this goes for, but I know Amruts can get expensive is all.
I immediately thought of Bruichladdich with the really enjoyable and delicious funk, it's so good when done right like this is. And yeah I agree, the finish is lacking a bit.
Glad you enjoyed it. Here in USA, cost of kadhambam is almost identical to Intermediate Sherry and Portonova (i.e. around $100-$125). So I would always recommend IS or Portonova in that case. However, in UK, this is correctly priced slightly lower than those two.
I seemed to like this way more than the Greedy Angels you sent me as a mystery. I didn't remember that one so much and I never posted a review, but I just went back to the notes I PM'd you and I really shat on that one, sorry lol. I'm glad I was able to redeem Amrut with this one though, it was really good."
"Reviews #38 & 39, a couple of young G&M Caol Ilas",,https://i.redd.it/qr4z4tz0n4901.jpg,"I hadn't planned on doing a side-by-side review like this, but I realized that I had two similarly aged G&M Caol Ila's in my sample collection, so it seemed obvious. The 11yr is courtesy of u/Dyllix and the 10yr is courtesy of u/Imaslapyou.

*****

**(A) G&M Caol Ila 11yr, 54.4%**

**Nose:** Light and fragrant but with strong musty peat. Sweet caramel, vanilla, citrus and pear fruitiness. Light brine. The peat has a clean smokiness to it, but the musty funk and fruitiness kind of reminds me of a wine finish.

**Taste:** Sweet and creamy, caramel and sharp clean peat. The peat mellows and melds beautifully with malt and clean vanilla. Fruit and citrus that keeps this light, floral and clean. But it still has a deliciously thick and creamy mouthfeel, best of both worlds situation.

**Finish:** Caramel malt and big, warm peat. Leaves wonderfully sweet and peaty with a light dose of ashy char.

*****

**(B) G&M Caol Ila 10yr 59.5%**

**Nose:** Briny, huge bbq meat peatiness, big warm vanilla. Peppery and black liquorice, plenty of blackened, earthy char. Oh my yes, peat with a vengeance

**Taste:** Gritty, earthy, charred peat you can chew on. Dark caramel malt and loads of vanilla. Huge presence in the mouth, it just explodes with charred peat and dark black liquorice sweetness. In the vein of Sparta: ""This...is...ISLAY!""

**Finish:** The briny, charred peat just keeps building sweeter and darker. Ends with beautiful, ashy peat char.

*****

The 11yr(A) is more similar to the Caol Ila I've had before, although extremely well executed and beautiful at cask strength. Heavy peat that manages to stay sweet and friendly. It has a thick, creamy mouthfeel that kind of flows along with the peat. The 10yr(B) is a briny Islay peat monster. Loads of darker Vanilla and ash, and that mouth-numbing black liquorice char I really love in an Islay. If I were being objective, it should be hard to pick a winner here since these are kind of just 2 great examples of different styles an Islay Scotch can take. But in all honesty I've got my personal preference, and that's the mean, briny, peaty punch to the face that is (B).

*****

**Knob Creek Single Barrel, Lukas Wine and Spirits, 60%**

**Nose:** Burnt caramel and deep charred oak, musty wood, some kind of cinnamon cherry candy(is that a thing?), refreshing minty clove. Sharp and crisp yet very smooth, wonderful nose.

**Taste:** Well balanced and very drinkable at full proof. Deeeep, gritty charred oak with lots of dark and syrupy cherry. Rich caramel, herbal mintiness. It has just enough kick to be interesting yet drinks very big and smooth.

**Finish:** Finishes long, charred and cherry cough syrup sweet. An unexpectedly awesome finish on this stuff.

*****

Just tasty and enjoyable through and through, I really don't have anything negative to say about this. It has a wonderfully delicious charred oak character that is deep, gritty and musty that goes very nicely with the darkly sweet cherry cough syrup and smoother caramel. It has a bit of a kick but still drinks great at full proof, I didn't even consider adding water to this. I would definitely buy a bottle.

Glad you liked it! For just a basic 9 year Pick it really was a solid dram. KC sib picks are definitely some of my favorites and are just overall great value. This bottle was only $43 you can‚Äôt beat that.
Yeah that's a killer price. I really liked the couple that I've tried, but I've yet to open up a bottle of my own. And I guess it's not unusual for them to be older than their 9 year age statement indicates too, do you know how old this one is?
This one happened to be a 9 year just like the standard sib. Lukas received three 9 year barrel samples and this one was the fav. I hope they get some older store pick barrels eventually!"
"A conundrum, how do you filter cork pieces out of a Whisky that you don't want filtered?",,https://i.redd.it/dljg6z3tw4401.jpg,"https://imgur.com/gallery/j6HIh

I transferred through a mesh, managed to keep the finer dust. But all the larger chunks in the original bottle on the right were lost since it was mixed with cork pieces and I had to rinse it all out. Once the original bottle dries out I'll be transferring the whisky back into it's original home.
Both a drink and a meal, all in one bottle.
My vote would be a fine mesh cocktail strainer.  That will catch the large chunks, without absorbing any liquid, and it certainly isn‚Äôt fine enough to ‚Äúfilter‚Äù the whisky.

[Decent one here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01731H12I/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_c_api_9pcnAbNYC4NNY)
Ouch. That is the definition of a conundrum. Um, did you bite that cork off? What I would do is as has been suggested, fine mesh then get the cork out, maybe clean the cork out of the mesh and back flush any of the Blackadder funk int a cup. Look for any more cork then add everything back in the bottle. Better to loose a bit of char than risk any cork though. I just had a cork break in my Macallan Classic cut. Luckily I‚Äôve saved old corks and one fit. I hate when that happens.
What do you need a cork for after opening the bottle?
Is that one of those little Westland bottles?
It's a Raw Cask, it's not barrier filtered so there's bits of barrel char floating around that I don't wanna lose, as seen [here](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-4Dm3R68UOrA/UyRP5Sn_vzI/AAAAAAAACRY/ga_U_473aiM/s1600-h/20140314-20140314173422-IMG_3720_small%25255B4%25255D.jpg). Kind of gimmicky I know, but I think it's pretty cool and luckily it still happens to be fantastic Scotch. First world problems.
I was trying to impress a girl I had over so I busted it out to show her the neat barrel char snow globe, she wanted to smell it and proceeded to wrench the cork in half. I played it cool, said no big deal and it happens sometimes with older bottles(which is true), but in my head I was like ""Nooo!""

Yeah, there's plenty of tiny char dust that pry wont get lost with normal straining, I'll figure it out. And I've kept every cork from every bottle for a while now, I have a gallon ziplock full of them for just such occasions. Sometimes you still spend a while finding one that fits.
1) open bottle

2) chug bottle

3) ???

4) profit
I think it's a Laddie 10yr bottle
TIL! Never had raw cask before so my ignorance was showing a bit. Sounds like amazing whisky!
So, did she make it up to you later? That's all we really care about.
Conflicting thoughts, yea, you can take sniff / noooo, leave my whisky alone ; ). So, what do you think of the Blairfindy?
Bingo
Oh yeah I see it now. Man I‚Äôve been wanting to try a blackadder bottle. You ever have the Amrut release?
Pretty neat huh? I've only tried 2 including this one, and they're both just so darn good.
Haha, I thought this might come up. And if all you're talking about is chicken Mcnuggets, beer, and good company, then yes she made it up. Unfortunately, nothing else ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I love it, haven't sat Down to really review or analyze it yet. I was gonna offer to send you some before I saw that you already have a bottle
No I've only tried this and a Balblair, both delicious

"Review #37, Octomore 7.2",,https://i.redd.it/enkiomwa1q201.jpg,"According to Bruichladdich's website, Octomore 7.2 ""marries spirit matured in classic American oak with spirit matured in casks that once held Syrah created in the great vineyards of the northern Rhone valley."" Sample courtesy of u/cjotto9.

*****

**Octomore 7.2, 5yr, 58.5%**

**Nose:** Super sweet, sharp and crisp. Intense yet silky smooth smoke with lemon and malt. Luscious berry richness, almost red wine-like. But this doesn't bludgeon the senses at all. It has impossibly huge peat of course, but somehow manages to be very sleek and sexy at the same, very ""clean.""

**Taste:** Sweet lemon with malt and funk hits first, very sharp and clean. But then, of course, lots of vanilla with huge clean peat that just washes over the palate like a wave. The flavors unfold with beautiful clarity and purpose like this Whisky was constructed. There's warm vanilla and sweet caramel, just the right amount of funk and ashy char. And it all has this clean, golden, shimmering quality. It's not boggy or earthy at all.

**Finish:** Even the finish is complex on this, it's so much more than just an intense smoke. I thought the initial wave of flavor was huge, but then on the finish the wave of sweet, ashy peat and vanilla just keeps coming and builds to ridiculous heights. Fucking delicious.

*****

Sometimes I think I've built up Octomore too much in my head, that I've put it up on a pedestal to justify the price and I'm just kind of jumping on a hype train. All those thoughts were immediately dispelled once I had this beautiful Scotch in my glass. It's such an experience from nose to finish, and every moment sipping and nosing it is just a delight. This one is very clean and sleek, it's flavors are huge but not thick or viscous if that makes sense. It doesn't bludgeon you, the flavors are complex and seem to move along with purpose. It has a sweet warmth and clean, ashy peat, and not much heavy handed Islay brine or bogginess. And something I find with all Octomores including this one is that the wine influence is never obvious to me, the flavors just all meld beautifully and create a single, cohesive work of art. Lovely stuff.

I have a chance to get a 6.1 for $170 Getting very tempted my the reviews I read about the various bottling seem quite consistent in quality. 

Thanks for the review. 
Now that‚Äôs a review. Simply put, it sounds like peated perfection. I‚Äôll add this to my ‚Äúwhiskies to try‚Äù list. 
The 6.1 is delicious, but I haven't had a bad Octomore yet. I remember it being more of a traditional, briny Islay peat bomb, I don't think it has a wine finish.
The 6.1 is impossibly elegant and complex. Go for it. 
It really is. And I would put 7.3 right there with it, that one is fucking fantastic too. It's been a while since I had 4.2, but I daresay I liked these as much or more.

"Reviews #34-36, Mystery Review xpost",,https://i.redd.it/k4dcbcvkafzz.jpg,"My samples are from u/Brent_in_Aurora. They're handy-dandy peel to reveal, but in the spirit of the mystery swap I'm just now peeling them as I post this.

*****

**Mystery Sample 1**

**Color:** [1.4](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg)

**Nose:** First impression is funky scotch! An interesting twangy butterscotch, berry fruitiness, creamy vanilla, nice maltiness. The fruit and funk says sherried Scotch, and it's the kind of sherry funk that is almost off-putting for me, but overall melds nicely and smoothly with the richer notes here.

**Taste:** A little watered down, but the flavor it has is good. Rich Caramel and maltiness, butterscotch, smooth and funky fruit, vanilla. No trace of any ethanol or harshness, just warm and pleasant, fruity and malty goodness. Leaves with more of that rich vanilla and funk, and sweet too.

**Thoughts:** Kind of straight forward and not huge, but tasty. It has that toned down, watered down, pleasant, and smooth character that reminds me of Japanese Whisky, but it has a richer maltiness I associate more with Scotch. It's warm and smooth, definitley a pleasant, comforting dram. It's about 43%-45%, and I would guess it has an actual 12 year age statement on it. I don't really have a good guess, but I'll say Hibiki 12 even though I don't remember it tasting so sherried.

Score: **6**

**Reveal:** [Kirkland 27 year, Alexander Murray & Co, 40%](/spoiler)

Wow, I knew this wasn't some NAS youngun', but sure didn't guess it was that old. It drank ok for 40% even if it was a little watered down. I bet this would have been phenomenal at 46%+.

*****

**Mystery Sample 2**

**Color:** [1.3](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg)

**Nose:** It's another Scotch! Sherry that is light, unobtrusive, and wonderful. Warm caramel and butterscotch malt, berry tartness, lightly rich chocolate. Some woody must too. Has that lightly sherried influence that is elegant(not boring) without being any kind of ""bomb."" With some air time it gets pretty fruity.

**Taste:** The elegant nose didn't prepare me for how strong this is. Deep, rich caramel and chocolate, gritty earthy notes of sawdust or leather, but brightens into extremely punchy fruitiness. Wow, I don't think I've ever had anything quite this fruity. It's a strong, in your face yet wholesome strawberry/berry fruitiness, really good. It's got me wondering if this is not sherry, but rather some other kind of wine finish. And I'll wager this is Cask Strength in the realm of 55%.

**Finish:** Superb finish. Long, rich, and syrupy sweet. Warm, with rich chocolate and a decent amount of wood char goodness. Wow, I'm a fan.

**Thoughts:** I wanna say this is something with the quality of an older Glendro Single Cask, but it feels a little more dynamic and punchy, doesn't have the smooth sherry saturated character I associate with those. But then again I've only ever tried a couple, so it's hard to say. Whatever it is it's delicious. It's Vivacious and elegant all at once. I'm gonna guess something like a 15yr Springbank or Bruichladdich, with really sweet PX or some weird wine finish.

Score: **8**

**Reveal:** [Deanston 10 PX, 57.5%](/spoiler)

This is a perfect example of why blind samples are so much fun. I hate to say it, but I may not have scored this so high knowing what it is. I just really felt like I was tasting some expertly crafted sherried Scotch here, a delight to drink.

*****

**Mystery Sample 3**

**Color:** [.7](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg)

**Nose:** A nice, pale malty malt. After all that sherry, I love me a malty malt! Creamy caramel malt, toffee and light vanilla, hay/straw, pretty prominent pear fruitiness.

**Taste:** Green apple and pear, grassy malt. Classic, easygoing sweet notes of Caramel and malt, not complaining at all. Overall it's light and effortless in character, not hugely deeeeep or RICH but still a good mouthfeel, pleasant and Scotchy. Leaves with sweet vanilla, again not much of a bang but pleasant overall.

**Thoughts:** Nothing against sherry or wine finished Scotch, but I'm very glad to have closed out these mystery tastings with this fine Malty Scotch. I realize now more than ever that this is what I truly love in Whisky, just straight forward malty, Bourbon barrel Scotchy Scotch. It's like coming home. I just really hope I'm right about the cask situation here and not embarrasing myself too bad. I'm gonna guess it's around 46-48%, and it reminds me a lot of a Balvenie 12 Single Barrel, although it's better than any I've had.

Score: **7**

**Reveal:** [Compass Box Oak Cross, 43%](/spoiler)

Haven't had a lot of Compass Box, but what I have tried hasn't really wowed me for the high price. This one has changed my perception a bit, since I believe it's actually a reasonably priced bottle from them that drinks really good at the proof.

Nice reviews, I enjoyed the read.  I'll have to check out some Deanston!
Wow, that Deanston review caught me by surprise. Nice reviews here, enjoyed reading them
Hey, great reviews. I‚Äôm keeping my eyes open for that Deanston PX. It sounds really good.
Me too, believe me. I'm not always big on sherry, so I'm excited to find one I liked that much. I actually could have gone on singing it's praises, but I want to get a bottle and really get to know it before I get ahead of myself. The score stands though since I scored it before the reveal.
Thanks! Looking forward to your review if you get one."
"Review #28, 1999 Wild Turkey 12yr",,https://i.redd.it/g0w5zx5d2fzz.jpg,"This sample came all the way from Belgium, a very big thanks to the wonderful u/Dixie_Mafia1982 for sending it my way.

*****

**Wild Turkey 12yr export, 1999, 50.5%**

**Nose:** Soft, creamy caramel and lots of warm vanilla. Big and smoooooth chocolatey oak without any of the mustiness I usually get with that kind of note. Some nuttiness, mild and easygoing herbal notes.

**Taste:** Just perfectly balanced, Chocolatey maple syrup and richer leathery notes. Coffee, gritty corn and grain, soft and warm herbs. Very smooth and controlled, not a yee-haw kind of bourbon at all. It's rich and has a thick mouthfeel, but the flavors flow effortlessly over the palate without ever slapping you in the face 

**Finish:** Super rich chocolatey caramel and thick Bourbon goodness rides out warm and long.

*****

I'm gonna be honest, it took me a minute to calibrate myself to this. It has a smooth, rich, effortlessly delicious quality that I don't taste a lot in Bourbon. It doesn't have much in the way of a bright, floral, fruity or spicy kick, it didn't explode or pop in a way that made me say ""whoa!"" Instead there's lots of richness and warmth: Vanilla, leather, smooth musty oak, and dank chocolatey maple sweetness without anything offensive. I've tasted much younger Bourbons that tasted way more oaky than this, there's nothing even remotely bitter or tannic here. Just smooth sailing, chocolatey rich Bourbon goodness. I feel like this actually appeals a lot to my Scotch sensibilities, it's elegantly balanced and rich and extremely drinkable. 

Score: **7**

You've described it pretty well, i'm glad you liked it and reviewed it. 
If i have to resume this bourbon in two words, it would be rich and well rounded. Great review, cheers! 
Yeah, exactly right. And this is one of those times where ""smooth"" is not a dirty word
I like a smooth bourbon but it needs to be tasty as well and this one is for sure. Enjoy what's left of the sample. "
"Reviews #32 & 33, Benriach peated 19yr Single Cask, Oloroso vs PX",,https://i.redd.it/7xgpg1jjzmwz.jpg,"These are 2 Benriach single casks from K&L that were released together. They are both peated with a sherry finish, 1994 vintage, and aged for 19 years. One was finished in a PX sherry cask, and the other was finished in an Oloroso cask. PX sample courtesy of u/CalZeta

*****

**Benriach 19 peated/Oloroso, 53.2%**

**Color:** [1.4](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg)

**Nose:** Clean peat and bandaids with earthy, sulphury sweetness. Lots of dark barrel char, black liquorice, tobacco.

**Taste:** Caramel sweetness and orange hits quick and bright, then quickly descends into earthy and peaty goodness. Sharp red wine, black liquorice and barrel char. Earthy and smoky and burnt, yum.

**Finish:** Very sweet but very dark and earthy. Leaves peaty and phenolic with strong root beer char.

*****

**Benriach 19 peated/PX, 51.5%**

**Color:** [1.6](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg), noticeably darker than the Oloroso barrel

**Nose:** Lighter overall. Clean peat, and the sweetness is lighter and fruitier. Caramel and malt with some creamy vanilla. This one has more sherry funk, but not in an off-putting way at all.

**Taste:** Fruity sherry and malt, the smokiness tastes light and friendly compared to the Oloroso. Rich warm caramel and delicious fruit, with a nice layer of smoke and char. All the flavors kind of dance around together wonderfully, nothing is real huge or overwhelming.

**Finish:** Big finish of Caramel and rich vanilla that descends into strong, clean peat and light root beer barrel char.

*****

The ""sweet peat"" is done very well with both of these, but they are different enough to make this a lot of fun as a side by side. The PX is fun and fruity, and it's the sweeter of the two but with a nice vanilla richness to it too. The Oloroso is still sweet, but it's a darker, earthier sweetness with much stronger phenolic peat. And it has more of a sulphury, red wine feel to it. If there's a unifying factor it's the dark, delicious char that tastes like burnt root beer or black liquorice. It's got a nice presence and then comes on strong in the finish of both of them, but it's definitley bigger in the Oloroso where it compliments the phenolic peat nicely.

They are both delicious and well executed, it's hard to pick a favorite. I think I might prefer the PX more because of the fruit and richer flavors, but the Oloroso is better at being a peat monster and the darker sweetness is hitting the spot as a winter dram.

Score: 

Oloroso Cask: **7.5**

PX Cask: **8**

I'm jealous of these sherried/peated 94' Benriach.  My one good scotch store only got the plain Jane 94' peated.  The sample I had was good, but not worthy of $100+ to me.
nice sbs.  thanks!
Cheers mate. Great review, I'll have to get to the sample you sent me soon!
I feel like we'd be flipped on scoring here.  Great reviews
I have both of these (fairly certain they're the same), and couldn't agree more, both fantastic. I haven't spent as much time with the olorosso, but I think I might like it a hair better than the PX. I've also seen a single cask un-peated olorosso from this same release, but not sure if it would be as good as the peated. 
I regret not buying multiples of each. I only bought the peated px. Moronic error.
It's certainly not common here either. The standard peated Benriach I had was delicious though, I think it was the 21yr Authenticus. It had the same deep root beer char these had.
Glad you liked it, sure was a fun one.
Thanks! I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on them too.
I almost scored them the same. I get the feeling that if I had a bottle of both I would go back and forth depending on my mood, but that's just how I felt at the time. They're both fantastic. 
Don't sweat it too much, there's no shortage of great Scotch.
Yeah, I love oloroso on scotch, particularly peaty scotch.  That weird funky funk shit gets me every time"

"Review #6, Mystery Sample",,https://i.redd.it/9zs0o24thnvz.jpg,"Mystery sample, courtesy of u/nsquare14. Also courtesy of him is the awesome sample bottle with a killer label!

**Nose:** This... is heavily sherried. Smooth and fruity, warm orange marmalade, light chocolate. smooth oak in there too. Yummy nose.

**Taste:** Maltier than the nose indicated, more smooth fruit. Warm strawberry and orange warmth. Some brighter syrupy grape sweetness. Not real huge or complex, but very creamy and fruity. Continues on into a sweet, chocolatey rich finish. It's hitting a lot of the classic sherry bomb notes for me that make it really hard to narrow down. I'm gonna put it down at about 46%. It has the effortlessly intertwined flavors of sherry and malt that usually indicate age to me, so no younger than 12yr but probably more like 15+. It's too hard to make a specific guess, but it reminds me a lot of older Glendronach single cask. 

Reveal: Ohishi Single Sherry Cask, cask 1257, 43.3%

EDIT: can't get the blackout spoiler to work on this sub



Well, turns out this is a sherried rice Whisky, so much for the maltiness I caught off it. I wish I could say there was something different or strange about this that could be explained by it being Rice Whisky, but this tasted straight up like a sherried Scotch. But then again the heavy sherry influence this had might mask other flavors. No idea about the age on this either, but probably much younger than I guessed too. Good stuff though, giving it a **7/10**

I've liked your artwork in the background since day 1.  I have the same print in my living room.  Who doesn't like monkeys drinking anisette?  Really cool your swap partner personalized it for you for the mystery sample.  Well done all around. 
I think I've read almost every review you've done because of that monkey.  Keep it up! 

Edit: that was supposed to reply to your previous comment, but I got off work early so I started boozing and, well, yea. 
He sent me this same mystery sample, and I picked a lot of the same notes you did.  Funnily enough, I also guessed a 15+ year Glendronach with something I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on.  It tasted to me like the sherrt used was px
Yeah, this sub doesn‚Äôt support spoiler tags.

Sounds pretty nice and supports my belief that choice of grains isn‚Äôt the most important step in making whisky.
Too cool right?
Well thanks man! At first I didn't mean for it to be a thing, but every time I would go to take a picture it was just my favorite angle in the house.

And yeah, it was pretty cool of him. I was really surprised to see them when I opened the package. He stalked my post history and found another piece of art in the background of a picture I posted, freaked me out before I remembered my old post haha. You can see it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScotchSwap/comments/78cmii/swap_with_unsquare14/), the cheeky devil!
:D

I'll raise my glass to you sir, if you're drinking right now you can do the same and we'll have ourselves a virtual cheers. 
How interesting. It really did remind me of a Glendronach with the sherry being so warm and soft, and very well integrated. I actually think Macallan does this quite well too, but not up to the same level as Glendronach.
I'd probably have to try a regular cask Rice Whisky, or a sherried Bourbon before I have an opinion on that.
u deserve it, amigo.
To the Monkey, random internet stranger friend!  Cheers! 
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/79i8t0/ww_review_28_mystery_sample/) was my review if you're interested.
What exactly is a ‚Äúregular cask‚Äù though? I know that we like to think of ex-bourbon casks as neutral, but are they really?

If you want to try a sherry finished bourbon, the Belle Meade one is pretty good.
Cheers!
I read it, pretty cool. Not surprising we would get similar notes on something so heavily sherried, but it's interesting we both guessed older Glendronach. Speaks well for the stuff.
I was actually thinking about that as I typed it, I ended up going with ""regular"" cask in my reply. I'm not sure if Japanese Whisky tends to use Bourbon casks or not. But they're more neutral than a sherry cask, I would think if there's any big differences in the taste of Rice Whisky it would show up more in an ex-Bourbon barrel.

There's not many Scotches I know of that use fresh charred oak, but from what I understand they still end up tasting like Scotch and not Bourbon. Glenlivet Nadurra and Octo 7.4 come to mind, although the latter being heavily peated might effect it.

I have been curious about that Belle Meade, never tried any of it.
Yeah, I was thoroughly impressed with it being my first rice whisky, as I've heard almost universally negative things about them."
"TIL that during the Vietnam war 30,000 American draft dodgers fled to Canada, the same number as Canadians that volunteered to fight",,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_and_the_Vietnam_War#Canadians_in_the_U.S._military,"A friend of mine was a Canadian that joined the US Army to fight in Vietnam. He went through basic, they shipped him over there, then somebody realized that he hadn‚Äôt taken his citizenship oath to become an American citizen. 

(Joining the US Army is the fastest way to get US citizenship - it‚Äôs from a law passed during the Civil War,  join the US Army, get US citizenship)

So anyway, the oath has to be taken on American soil, so they ship him back to Honolulu.

But they never put a return date on his orders.

So he took a two week vacation in Honolulu, and then went back to Vietnam. When he got there, his CO was super pissed and threatened to have him brought up on charges of desertion. So my friend pulled out the orders, showed him that there was no return date, and told him he was lucky he came back at all. 


My uncle's best friend from Vietnam was a Canadian soldier who volunteered to fight in the US Army ""Because he loved war"". Seems like the dude had a screw loose but was apparently a great friend and soldier.
One of these Canadian volunteers was Peter Lemon, the only US service member to win the Medal of Honor for actions performed while high. 

https://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/medal-of-honor-peter-lemon-was-high-on-marijuana-he-single-handedly-fought-off-two-waves-of-vietcong.html
And I have read that the easiest way to avoid the draft was to simply not register.  Only a hundred or so men were prosecuted for failing to register.
I‚Äôm one of those Canadians that served in Vietnam (1968-69). As I recall the deal was this - if a foreign national serve with the US in times of ‚Äònational crisis‚Äô the time required to quality for citizenship was reduced from 5 years to 3. However, I was so turned off by the war and the politics surrounding it I simply returned to Canada as soon as I was discharged and used the GI bill to put me through university.
Not disparaging the bravery, valor, and patriotism of those who fought, but considering how much of a skeevy clusterfuck Vietnam turned out to be, you can't really blame the people who really, really didn't want to go.

War is bad enough, but a war fought on particularly flimsy pretenses is an even worse reason to die.
Cheech Marin went to Vancouver in 1967 to avoid the draft and met Tommy Chong there. 
My grandpa was a Canadian working in Alaska in the oil rigs and got his draft notice, I think it‚Äôs because he had a green card or something. So he just moved back to Canada cause he didn‚Äôt believe in the war.
Must have had bone spurs. 
Fools equalize
The other day a guy struck up a conversation while we were both waiting for our winter tires to be put on and eventually the conversation made its way around to him having been shot in Vietnam while serving int he military. I asked if he was from the US and had served in the US Army before coming to Canada. He said, no, he was Canadian and was in a Canadian Army unit that was stationed in Vietnam as observers. All I can think of was the brief Canadian deployment to Vietnam after the cease-fire as part of the international peacekeeping force, but I didn't realize that they were involved in combat. Any ideas?
Mohamed Ali was one of those draft dodgers. 
Just curious what were the.motivation of these canadian to join a foreign army and go fighting a war far away ?

It's not like loosing the war had any negative impact on US/Canada
I‚Äôd probably dodge it too, to be honest.
Why would you volunteer to fight in such a stupid unnecessary war
> the same number

what an astonishing coincidence. OR IS IT?!

*foil hats for sale in the lobby*
Good ol' North American exchange program
Weird to think of it but it turns out my grandparents are actually draft dodgers despite having lived in Murica for 5 years or something.
I'd like to meet any US or Canadian whose freedom was directly threatened by the Viet Cong. What a scam. 
Good on them, I'd have done the same. Pointless war
who volunteers to die in a pointless war? what a bunch of idiots 
why would anyone volunteer for that catastrophe of a conflict?  It was failure even before it started.
Tradesies
I learned that they call it the American war over there.
[An excellent Sam Roberts song](https://youtu.be/tI6rInBvpmI) on this topic. 
Guess here-- The Canadians that wanted to fight drew heavily from First Nations, Scots-Irish and Arcadians. The Americans that sought asylum were more likely Anglo   
Good, and this just makes Canadians look bad
An Aye for a Neigh
Such an even number, damn.
Why did US draft for Vietnam but not for Korea?
All they had to do was claim bone spurs. Dumbasses.
Just wars don't require drafts.
Bless all the sane people that fled from the usa. Why would you volunteer to fight in a war, especially in such a fucking retarded war? And why are these vietnam vets regarded as heros?
I bet the ones who came home felt like a right bunch of fools.
I'll take 30k brave Canadians over 30k coward Americans any day.
Good trade. Our worst for their best.
 Volunteering for a war that the US started is dumb but people line up for some reason.
Canada's response: sorry.
All the earstwhile veterans of the Vietnam war need to sue Nick Turse and General Telford Taylor's estate.  Be forewarned you are unlikely to win.
Damn. The clerk who typed those orders up probably got his ass handed to him by his superiors.

I never would have returned. I would have followed that order to its fullest!
Canadians can't just jump the border and serve anymore, ""Green card"" also known as legal permenent residency is required
You don't just get citizenship by being in the military 
Teddy Roosevelt grew up as a sickly kid, so he really wanted to prove who much of a man he is.  He couldn't wait to go fight, somewhere, anywhere.

Thats the kinda guy I want by my side in a war like Vietnam. 

Edit: im being serious not sarcastic
Since he moved to the US when he was 12 and was already a US citizen when he joined the army, he wasn't really a Canadian volunteer.
I don't think I could kill a bunch of illiterate peasants while I was high. It must have been the shitty weed back then I guessü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
They ""fixed"" that by tying eligibility for federal finance aid for college to selective service registration. I registered when I turned 18, but the post office never sent it in. When I sent in my FAFSA, they sent me a notice that I wasn't registered. Did it again and I guess it took since my Apple was processed.
[deleted]
Do not do this. You will face legal repercussions and will get no federal aid for college. Just register like every other male in the country. The military doesn't want draftees anyway. Would take another World War to bring it back and by then all of your friends will have probably joined up anyway. 
I'm glad it worked out for you. Politics aside, thank you for your service to my country, or our country, or whatever we should call it. :)
Now, if only Canada would go to war. I would happily sign up in exchange for Canadian citizenship!
Exactly.  My mom used to say some pretty derogatory things about draft dodgers early in the war.  After watching the news about the how many young men were killed, wounded, and captured,  she said ""I don't blame them for not wanting to go.""   This is probably the last time my mother has admitted she was wrong.

How odd, that must have been surprising to receive. I'm enjoying all the little stories like this about Canadians' experiences with the Vietnam war and the USA.
Hehe I get it...good one
It's interesting to me that with just a few comments here you can already see the different viewpoints that really divided the country.
I don't get it.
[deleted]
No, he went through the judicial system and spent time in jail for refusing to stand for his draft. He accepted the consequences. Every man who went to Canada and stayed both avoided and dodged the draft and evaded the law until Carter granted blanket pardons in 1977.
Men having been signing up for wars that didn't affect their country for ages. Why did the British romantics leave to defend Crimea? Why did Hemingway fight for the Spanish Republicans? Why did Yeats' Irish Airman sign up for death, when ""my countrymen Kiltartan‚Äôs poor/ No likely end could bring them loss/ Or leave them happier than before""?
[deleted]
WWI went the other way around. The US had a strongly isolationist policy and didn't join the war until almost the very end, but a lot of young American men felt the war was too important to sit out, and crossed the border into Canada to enlist.
My friends dad volunteered to go.   When I asked him about it he said that one day he and his friends were watching a bunch of John Wayne movies, got drunk, and drove across the border where the enlisted with the marines.   
You want to satisfy your inner human base desire to kill and destroy. 
> Just curious what were the.motivation of these canadian to join a foreign army and go fighting a war far away ?

The opportunity to kill other people with no legal consequences is appealing to some.
Some people just fucking love imperialism. 
The hypothetical spread of communism would affect them though
It seems stupid now because we didnt live it, but at the time communism was considered a real threat across the world. It was a genuine fear among regular populations. Propaganda certainly played a part in this but it was genuinely considered a concern to the average person. People will ask the same question about why people volunteered to fight in Iraq in the future. Except in this case, communism was considered a real threat to mainland america and western way of life. (whether deserved or not)

people fought in both wars for the same reason. To protect their country and their values. 
I would say

1) You actively enjoy killing people

2) You were tricked
Maybe you felt that South Vietnamese deserved to have a free country?
Acadians you mean?
wasn't that a police action and not a war?
The US DID draft for Korea 
Nope that's why in WWI and WWII young men were bullied into service by the recruiters driving some into suicide when after the bulling they were marked as unfit and had to carry the burden of not even being good for that
Wars just don't require drafts.

Wars don't just require drafts.

Wars don't require just drafts.

...
Congratulations on repeating the disgust felt towards Vietnam vets that led to so many negative outcomes.  The reason that Americans go out of their way to thank servicemen today is the shameful way we treated them after Vietnam.  ""Never again"" is the motto.  
Because even if you don't agree with it they put their life on the line for what they believed was right. I don't agree with military worship or anything that some people in this country do but Vietnam vets went through things that you and me could never imagine because they believed it was right or realized that if they didn't do it someone else would have to 
I'd rather go up north for a few years than die in some god forsaken foreign jungle in a war that shouldn't have even happened in the first place for a people who would just spit on them when they got back and a government that saw them as nothing more than cannon fodder in the field and a fucking burden back home.

Yeah bunch of *fucking* cowards, am I right?
The Vietnam war was a completely unnecessary waste of lives. Good on those Americans for refusing to take part.
Is it cowardly to not want to die in a third world country for no reason?

What would you do if some politician decided to draft you to go die in Syria?
> cowards

That's a funny way to spell ""smart people"".
Just curious... are you a Trump supporter?
Those 30k cowards should never have been allowed to come back to the USA. Gutless twats every last one of them. 

My father was against the war as well, and when he was drafted, he became a CO and served as a medic, because while he was against the war, he knew if he didn‚Äôt serve, someone would have to go in his place. 

The best part is, I will bet you 90% of those 30k were leftists who were heavy into the civil rights movement. 

And you know what? When they ran away? Guess who was disproportionately drafted to take their place? That‚Äôs right, underprivileged black men. So not only are they cowards, they‚Äôre hypocrites. 
Sadly not including our traitorous president

thats because once they were caught, they were sent to the front lines. ""lets see you pull a fast one on the enemy!""

Just watch ‚ÄúGangs of New York‚Äù sometime. They even reference it there.

Tongue in cheek nod to how the Union filled its ranks with bodies to fight the South. 

And loved war to death. At least, he loved it until his son died in WW1, a war he encouraged his son to fight. He apparently was never the same and looked on with a glazed over look for the rest of his days, repeating ""Quinty"", the childhood name of his son, whistfully. Apparently even Teddy grew to learn that war is hell, and that all its glory is moonshine.

You presume that those fueling passions for war don't have ulterior motives.

As someone who volunteered to go to Afghanistan when I was 19, almost all people who seek out war do it because they think they are supposed to, because it's noble or will make you a man or some shit like that.

This Canadian had the glory of war incepted into him.  Glory isn't taken from anything resembling war

It isn't like the people who order men to go to war are also fighting in it themselves, however.

It still means you have a screw loose, loving combat for the sake of combat is dangerous and not beneficial.

Orange you glad they gave you a second chance? 
I know desperate times can cause laws to be changed, but I thought the draft only applied to 18-25 year olds. What point would there be to giving you until 26 to register? You'd be able to game the system and not register until right before your 26th birthday and only be eligible for draft for a very short time.

i doubt it.  the way things are now with a more world wide view of things and less TV only dogma i'd imagine a lot more draft dodgers.

aaand i just remembered the number of people who get news from facebook.  great
> Politics aside, thank you for your service to my country, or our country, or whatever we should call it. :)

We should call it a long list of war crimes that made the communists look like amateurs.

This should be required viewing before thanking the ""liberators"": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Soldier_(film)
Volunteering to fight in Vietnam was a foolish thing to do.

Edit: Also draft dodging was foolish.
this is correct. yea he went against the draft, but not dodged it
Generally such people fought because they actually supported one side in the conflict. Its hard to imagine though why anyone would have willingly supported America's involvement in Vietnam though, we were unequivocally the Bad Guys in that conflict.
youthful exuberance = stupidity
let's not forget to thank your local MP for not getting Canada into that nonsense
 Or maybe they believed in the cause of defending South Vietnam against the war that North Vietnam was waging against them. 
""Git some!""
There was a massive counter propaganda campaign against communism in the west, mostly driven by the US. 
The politicians and the wealthy were very worried that if communism were take gain a foothold in the west, that revolution was inevitable and they'd be first against the wall. 
Communism promised to turn power to the ordinary citizens and take it away from the elites. So the elites were understandably scared. And went on a major propaganda campaign which included witch hunts and imprisonment for people who even suspected of communism. 

The west, and Canada in particular, saw the US as their leader and so trusted that if it was being serious about communism, then it was probably a real threat. 

Support for Vietnam was stirred up by a theory that was invented called the ""domino effect"", where experts claimed that if one country in a region turned to communism, then it was inevitable that it would spread to all other countries in the region. 
Communism was like a virus, promising to enslave populations. They were relentless, godless, inhuman monsters whose only goal in life was to destroy your way of life.
*Nineteen eighty-four* wasn't just sci-fi, it was a social commentary on what was believed to be the inevitable global takeover of communism. 

So the US went to Vietnam on the pretense of driving the Communists back and preventing the Domino effect from happening. If Vietnam fell, all of Asia was lost. People bought it - even those who sold it, believed what they were saying - and there was initially widespread support for fighting in Vietnam. 

Of course we know now that it was all flawed. The domino effect doesn't exist. Communism, like capitalism, is doomed to failure because human greed created oligarchs and inequality. Communism was never a real threat to the west. But hindsight is 20:20. Someone would have needed to be very plugged into geopolitics to know the truth at the time.
> whether deserved or not

Spoiler alert: it was deserved.  
It was due to  *The Domino Theory*  which was credited to Eisenhower that the US intervened in Vietnam after the French defeat in Indochina at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 - it was""reasoned"" that if one country in a region come under the influence of communism the chances are very likely that surrounding countries would collapse too just like a row of dominos would - this dubious theory was in practice from the 50s through the 80s and was primarily used to justify American intervention in the world back in the hysterical Cold War Dark Ages.
Sometimes it's not even that. Some people actually have a passion for protecting their country (or in this case another country) and even if they hate war, they will do unspeakable things, i'm not saying this was more common, but i can guarantee that that is a train of thought that many people (including one of my own relatives) had. 

Don't ask me why, i'm just telling you his opinion..
I mean if you looked into the history of the south Vietnamese they didnt really have a free country to begin with. 
na man... they rocked the pinball hard
Ya! 40k reference for the win
So only wars can have draft? Vietnam wasn't a war either, it was a conflict. 
You are implying WWI and WWII were just wars.
No one is disrespecting those who were forced to go. 

Just the ones dumb enough to volunteer for such idiocy.
I agree but i refuse to believe that ""thinking it was right"" is a valid justification for anything. On the bottom line they went murdering and got murdered for nothing. Volunteering for such a dumb thing is the modern natural selection.
BUT TRUMP DODGED THE DRAFT REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Yeah, fuck all those South Vietnamese that were slaughter, tortured and imprisoned by the North.   Not my problem.
Get a hobby
And I'm sure your dad got a hero's parade when he came home, right? Take your ignorance elsewhere. I don't see you jumping at the gun to go die in the jungle fighting a rich man's battles for him.
A lot of assumptions there buddy. 
So not supporting the wholesale murder of women and children is cowardice? Your dad probably saved the lives of many rapists and murderers, allowing them to continue.
Just curious... are you a Trump supporter?
Rapin' Bill has not been President for 2 decades, sweetheart.
This guy knows the military.
*actually does*
Sent to the front lines??? Really, you want an army full of people who hate it?  There are very teachable moments in history where that time of thinking has utterly failed.
Oh boy . . .

No that's not how it works. As usual the USCIS page is ambiguous and lacking details about what is waived and what is expedited.

The applicant MUST be a US Permanent Resident. Only Permanent Residents can join the military, not illegal immigrants, not immigrants who are still on a visa. They need to have their green card.

The continuous residence (5 years after gaining permanent residency, 3 months in a state) requirements are waived. The filing fee is waved although an $85 biometric fee is still required. The requirement to be in the US for at least 30 months is also waived. 

As far as I can tell, the applicant is still required to file the application correctly and take the interview and test.

So no, they do not ""just"" get citizenship, they go through an expedited process.

Im sorry which war and which army is this?
Wow
So glad to hear you're doing better, man...
Thank you for sharing, friend. You write well. 
I found your English exquisite and your thoughts profound.
And all for nothing. The country is worse off than before. You were just a puppet for the Chinese Government and corrupt communist leaders at the end of the day. 
I could easily see people choosing war over boredom. 

>  almost all people who seek out war do it because they think they are supposed to, because it's noble or will make you a man or some shit like that.

I don't know where you served, or with whom, but your experience is FAR different than my own.  Most of the guys I served with were exactly where they wanted to be, and the single biggest draw for them was the rush, the adrenaline, and the challenge.
Not anymore, but they sure as shit did for the vast majority of our species.

Yeah....Canadian on paper. Thats about it.
Jokes on them. I dropped out after my first year.
> What point would there be to giving you until 26 to register?

They're aren't ""giving you until 26 to register'.  You can't register after you turn 26, and if you have never registered by then, you can never correct that fact.  You're still eligible for the same punishments as you were as an unregistered 18-25 year old, but now they're permanent.  
lol, yup.  
Why would draft dodging be bad? Other than in the case of a red dawn scenario. Which if you think that is possible you are insulting the largest navy and second largest Air Force in the history of the world. 
Calm down, I know it was a fucked up war and we did lots of fucked up stuff, but I doubt that's what many of those kids or the guy I was replying to went there for. We were anything but ""liberators."" I was just being nice. That does look interesting though, I've never heard of it. 
> Also draft dodging was foolish.

No it wasn't.  
That's a mean thing to say. You wouldn't volunteer but not everyone is you. 
That's a pretty harsh take considering the offenses North Vietnam was willing to exact on its own populace and continued to do afterwards to the South Viets and the Montagnards and Hmong. Unequivocally, the NV and NVA were pretty evil and sadistic in many numerous and unique ways of their own choosing and had been for a much longer period of time- especially considering that region of Southeast Asia had been in on-off wars for over 1,000 years before the US ever got involved.
Politicizing people's perspective on fighting wars, gg
This is true!  I have a Vietnamese friend whose family was from the south.  They were absolutely against the communist North.

Think of it this way - if suddenly the Republicans decided to stage a coup and take over the country, would you be ok with it?  Would you want help from another country?  Would it be worthwhile for that country to get involved?

It's way more complex than ""the US shouldn't have been there"".  You could make that argument for WW2 as well.  Fight the Japanese, but let Britain deal with Germany on their own.
""How can you shoot women and children??""   ""Easy, you just don't lead em so much. Woooo!! Ain't war hell?""
This has ""millennial trying to explain history"" all over it. It wasn't just the elites scared of communism on, the common folk weren't just scared because of propaganda. And Canada didn't oppose communism because daddy USA didn't. This is the most over simplification of complex history I've seen today.

Edit: And it's not deep. ""People bought it, even those who sold it..."" Ya, that's why they ""sold it."" Not everything's a conspiracy, and you could be in an ""elite"" position and genuinely believe communism was negative for everyone, not just your own power.
Hardly.  Our interventionist foreign policy pushed countries to side with the Soviet Union since it was their only option.

I still think they had to be tricked into thinking that the Vietnam war had anything to do with protecting any country
> Some people actually have a passion for protecting their country (or in this case another country)

Is this why they killed or rape Vietnamese civilians with such enthusiasm once they got there?
Alot better than the North Vietnamese
Ooooh, clever :-)
No, actually, not a reference to the 40K Guard regiments. Acadia was a French colony in Canada, or, what would become Canada. It was the first real European colony if you don't count the Norse/Icelandic ruins in NewFoundLand.


WWII was a just war for the allies 


Britain went to war to protect Poland, Russia went to war because the Germans were literally trying to exterminate the Slavic race, the USA went to war because it was attacked and Germany declared war on it.
How fucking stupid do you have to be to think that WW2 wasn't completely justified for the Allies? I'm not just asking that rhetorically I'd really like an answer
You are grouping one of the most pointless wars and one of the most important wars together 
The wars we're just the carving and slicing of land and political blunders that followed were def not
**NEVER AGAIN**
Good to see the tolerant left, back at it again with the basic human decency for treating people who suffered and died like human trash.


When people point out that Trump dodged the draft, they are not criticizing Trump. They are pointing out the hypocrisy of people who fetishise the military, but support a man who dodged the draft.
Im sure all the South Vietnamese who got caught in the crossfire were very happy to have us bombing their villages and killing their families rather than the North
Said the pot to the kettle. 
No. I went to the desert. We haven‚Äôt had a jungle war since I was 2. 

My dad didn‚Äôt need a hero‚Äôs parade. Being able to look at yourself knowing that someone else didn‚Äôt have to carry your burden due to cowardice has always been enough for him. 
Not really. It‚Äôs a fact that underprivileged minorities were drafted and deployed to combat zones at a higher rate and it‚Äôs a fact that the far left was far more opposed to the war, so..... it‚Äôs more of a reasonable deduction than an assumption.  
Propaganda, folks. 
I do not. However, I did vote for him because as bad as he is, I believe Clinton would have been far worse. I was unwilling to NOT vote, and I was unwilling to piss my vote away on a 3rd party candidate. If it‚Äôs any consolation to you, I live in a state where my vote didn‚Äôt matter. 
Just curious are you just going to keep asking that? 
Would that make his opinion less valid?

Yeah I never met a non citizen serving but I thought that they were allowed and legalized because I have met plenty of foreign born in my time. Either way I appreciate everyone's sacrifice in fighting for this country especially if they have been here for a small amount of time. I recommend this article on Lance Cpl. Jose Gutierrez who wasn't a US Citizen when he gave his life for our country.

You can't be a world war 1 pilot without being reckless, kinda like the first generation astronauts
I have zero issue with draft dodgers. I don't find it cowardly in the slightest. In fact, I find that it takes a stronger man to stand up to someone than one who says ""OK"" when someone they never met wants to sign their life away.

However, I do feel that if you are a draft dodger, you lose the right to run for office or get pissed at those who ""disrespect the troops.""

I don't feel it should be illegal though. If you can't find enough willing people for your cause, you should reevaluate your cause.
Nepalese civil war, Communist party of Nepal, unless i'm mistaken
The Chinese government had literally nothing to do with the Nepalese civil war. And what ""corrupt communist leaders"" do you speak of exactly? 

Pretty shitty of you to go putting someone down who experienced it first hand about something you clearly know nothing about.
This is exactly the reason many joined in the American Civil War.

Think about it. You've probably never left your home town before, and you'll likely be a farmer like the umpteen generations before you. War provides a quick method out for you to see the world, give purpose, *and you get paid to do it*.
Hence why people were so quick to join up during WW1.  They thought it would be over by Christmas and a lot of young men saw it as an adventure not to be missed.  Reality was something completely different.  
I've heard more than one quote from those who were stationed on forward operating bases that sometimes they'd wish someone would shoot at them so they would have something to do. Go to war to escape boredom, find even more boredom.
If you want excitement, pick up a thrilling hobby that doesn't become the pivotal moment of your existence
Because murdering innocent civilians is way more exciting than plowing your farm...

what in the actual fuck?  so the draft is still a thing in the US? 

at least potentially?
i don't think it's bad actually.  i see it as immoral to take people by force and force them to work and die without rights.
So? The standard for not being foolish is not ""someone would do it anyway."" 
I'm not saying it. Cinogamia is.
You‚Äôre right. Don‚Äôt let these people tell you otherwise lol. They‚Äôd be the people during Vietnam who‚Äôd spit on the graves of fallen soldiers because they don‚Äôt understand the difference between one soldier who fought for a country he believed in, and the government which started the war.

You can think the government was foolish all you want, but don‚Äôt call people who died fighting in Vietnam foolish. There‚Äôs a big difference
lol so wars are just for killing and not political... riiiiiiiiight.

Hey man.. if you're a psychopath and like killing that's also not good.
I don't want to just copy and paste from Wikipedia, but I'm going to anyway because I am legitimately concerned based on your posts in this thread that you don't know how the Vietnam was started or how South Vietnam conducted itself.

>In January 1950, the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union recognized the Viet Minh's Democratic Republic of Vietnam, based in Hanoi, as the legitimate government of Vietnam. The following month the United States and Great Britain recognized the French-backed State of Vietnam in Saigon, led by former Emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, as the legitimate Vietnamese government.

Vietnam was divided after World World II and a war of independence against the French.

>U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote in 1954, ""I have never talked or corresponded with a person knowledgeable in Indochinese affairs who did not agree that had elections been held as of the time of the fighting, possibly eighty percent of the population would have voted for the Communist Ho Chi Minh as their leader rather than Chief of State B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i.""

Vietnam was temporarily partitioned into two states, with plans to reunify them with a vote later. Ho Chi Minh had a great amount of public support, enough that South Vietnam and the US were worried if not convinced they could not win a democratic election against him.

>In a referendum on the future of the State of Vietnam on 23 October 1955, Di·ªám rigged the poll supervised by his brother Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu and was credited with 98.2 percent of the vote, including 133% in Saigon. His American advisors had recommended a more modest winning margin of ""60 to 70 percent."" Di·ªám, however, viewed the election as a test of authority. Three days later, he declared South Vietnam to be an independent state under the name Republic of Vietnam (ROV), with himself as president. Likewise, Ho Chi Minh and other communist officials always won at least 99% of the vote in North Vietnamese ""elections"".

Due to this and concerns about how the conduct of both sides made a fair election effectively impossible, polls regarding the concept of unification and elections in South Vietnam were rigged to an absurd extent with American support.

>A devout Roman Catholic, Di·ªám was fervently anti-communist, nationalist, and socially conservative. Historian Luu Doan Huynh notes that ""Di·ªám represented narrow and extremist nationalism coupled with autocracy and nepotism."" The majority of Vietnamese people were Buddhist, and were alarmed by actions such as Di·ªám's dedication of the country to the Virgin Mary.
>
>Beginning in the summer of 1955, Di·ªám launched the ""Denounce the Communists"" campaign, during which communists and other anti-government elements were arrested, imprisoned, tortured, or executed. He instituted the death penalty against any activity deemed communist in August 1956. According to Gabriel Kolko about 12,000 suspected opponents of Di·ªám were killed between 1955 and 1957 and by the end of 1958 an estimated 40,000 political prisoners had been jailed.

Diem quickly became an autocratic leader, imprisoning and torturing people just as the North did. (Remember ""tiger cages""? Yeah, mostly a South Vietnamese thing.) Many of his policies were massively unpopular.

>Despite successes in politics, economics and social change in the first 5 years, Di·ªám quickly became a dictatorial leader. With the support of the United States government and the CIA, ARVN officers led by General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh staged a coup and killed him in 1963. The military held a brief interim military government until General Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh deposed Minh in a January 1964 coup. Until late 1965, multiple coups and changes of government occurred, with some civilians being allowed to give a semblance of civil rule overseen by a military junta.

South Vietnam eventually became a full on military junta, subject to many coups of its own. 

Your analogy is wholly inadequate. You'd need to butcher it to something like ""Republicans decide to stage a coup, against the Chinese backed Democrat military junta who declared Republican activity was a capital crime and shit all over Christians and who took power after a rigged election in the aftermath of the Russian occupation"" before it starts getting even close. Now, I'm not claiming everything I said is 100% accurate or unbiased, but I think it's closer than the picture you were originally painting.
There was suppose to be a referendum to vote on the future of the country.  The United States and South Vietnam refused to allow it to take place because they knew they would lose a fair election.  
>This is true! I have a Vietnamese friend whose family was from the south. They were absolutely against the communist North.

I have a friend whose family is from the North and feels the same way. The stories he told me are really harrowing. It really makes it sickening to see these recreational SJW communist types. They really don't understand what they're emulating. 
""Anyone who runs is a VC, anyone who stands still is a well disciplined VC huhahahaha!""
And your comment has ""I disagree with this, but can't say why"" all over it. You haven't said anything that contradicts my post, it clearly just irritates you. 

Yes, it's a massive simplification. But most history is relatively simple when you get down to core motivations.

The West feared Communism for the same reasons that people fear Socialism and Islam today. They are afraid of losing their wealth and afraid of losing their identity. The fears may have been unfounded, but that doesn't mean they weren't honestly held, and I'm clear about that in my post.

The most interesting aspect of the Cold War was that the attitudes to the USA in the Soviet Union pretty closely mirrored the attitudes in the opposite direction. That the USA was an aggressive, militaristic race, rotten and corrupt society and hell bent on conquering the world. And the Soviet Union produced just as much anti-West propaganda as anti-USSR propaganda was produced by the West.
To be fair every time a socialist or communist sort of way of organizing society is set up, it is immediately attacked. Look at the Paris commune, 1917, where 14 countries invaded Russia to stop the communists, that's where the Coke war started for them. Or Allende in chile, Sankara in Burkina Faso, Honduras, Guatemala. Not even just in the international stage but inside countries too, all working class organizations like unions are attacked and weakened.
That's actually pretty presumptuous of you to say. I'm not saying that there were direct causal links between the Vietnam War and the fall of communism, or that it was necessary or right in hindsight.     
 
 
 


But the ripple effects of the war were extremely far reaching and had serious implications in a lot of neighbouring and stakeholder countries. Just imagine if communism wasn't delayed in Vietnam. Would other countries become communist? Laos, Thailand and a lot of other major Southeast Asian countries had severe problems with communist insurgencies and because of the U.S. interest in the area, some of them decided to support the War as well. If SEA became largely communist, we might have a very different world today. Just imagine the Straits of Malacca being controlled by nations that favor the Chinese or Soviets. We might live in a vastly different world today.  
    
  

TL:DR butterfly effect and shit
Without the wrecking ball of capitalism, communism would still be around and would have likely taken over most of the world by now.  North Korea and Cuba are still going strong.  
It kind of was though North Vietnam invaded the south and the US was just defending their ally 


Lolol I love how you just choose to forget that North Vietnam INVADED the south and the US was just defending their ally 
a whole lotta freedom https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/the-burning-monk-1963/
It's just Newfoundland! 
To be fair, if you're an American or Canadian isolationist, there was very little threat from Nazi Germany. The USA/Canada would have been better off minding their own business.

Of course, if you have any sense of how global politics work, or any sense of moral responsibility, you know that's bullshit...
Why does the right always expect tolerance for stupidity?

I've noticed that seems to be a trend.

You say something racist, or something uneducated, then when someone calls you out it's ""So much for the tolerant left""

Why should anyone have to tolerate you being a fucking idiot? Just stop being a fucking idiot and you won't have to hear about it, genius.

Talk to a few of them. Most South Vietnamese that managed to make it out are very grateful to the US for their role in the Vietnam War. 
And the cat and cradle and the silver spoon 
>No. I went to the desert. We haven‚Äôt had a jungle war since I was 2. 

Oh so you volunteered, you weren't drafted and ordered by your government to go die over seas. Is everybody that didn't enlist in the army a coward too?

>My dad didn‚Äôt need a hero‚Äôs parade.

Well that's good, because not a single Vietnam vet got one regardless of his contribution.

>Being able to look at yourself knowing that someone else didn‚Äôt have to carry your burden due to cowardice has always been enough for him. 

It's almost like you think the government was like ""well Jimmy Smith bailed on his duty so go fetch me that black kid from down the road who wouldn't have had to fight otherwise"". 
Have you ever seen anything from a different perspective? I just mean in general, like if there was this one time you kinda thought you did or something. 
What? Are you suggesting those things didn't happen?
No, I don't care who you voted for. It just seems hypocritical to me to simultaneously think that 30,000 people who refused to serve in Vietnam should never be allowed to enter the United States while another draft dodger is fit to serve as president. 

I don't generally have any problem with people over political differences, nor with you.
Voting for third party was and is the only solution. 

The only other alternative is Hillary (or Trump). Now *that* is pissing your vote away!
If someone thinks 30,000 people should not be allowed to enter the country for dodging the draft during the war in Vietnam, yes, that's a natural question to ask. Because I don't see how a person could condemn 30,000 draft dodgers to life long exile and then vote for one to be president.

Too bad neither of them answered.
Thinking 30k people should not be allowed to enter the United States for dodging a draft while supporting the candidacy of a draft dodger as president of the United States? Yeah, sort of. 
Yes.
Nice try Bill Gates
Do you know that you can?

I used to have the hardest time getting up my whole life. I hate being late, I hate conflict and awkward social situations. By the time I got to college the walking in late is really awkward trying not to make noise. I get sick if I don't get breakfast. Basically I was making myself really uncomfortable and having bad mornings over what I realized was about 15 or so minutes. If I left about 15 minutes earlier and missed traffic it took me half the time to get to school/work and I'd have the most peaceful morning sipping my coffee and reviewing notes. 

This took a couple things. Often the night before it required some prep. Finish homework so I wasnt trying to do it last minute before school. Made sure I had more clean laundry so finding clothes wasn't so hard. I packed a lunch if I needed one the night before and packed my book bag with anything I needed for class/work the next day. When I got up I just had to get dressed and eat and brush my teeth. I wasn't rushing to print my paper and accidentally out of ink, I already had it tucked away in my bag. You have time to get ink the night before but not the morning of! I wasn't rushing to school all stressed or running out of time to grab coffee, or breakfast. I had to tell myself through the misery of preparation ""but you'll have a great day tomorrow if you do this"". I shut down any negative thoughts as soon as they started and repeated that in my head and warmed myself in the feeling of how great a peaceful morning felt. Anything that takes 5 minutes the night before takes my half awake brain 10-15 minutes so this was a lot of saved time in the morning. 

The last step was not snoozing my alarm. As soon as it went off it was like an out of body experience- it felt like I was trying to consciously control someone else's body. I told myself as soon as it goes off I will open my eyes, and I will sit up and get dressed. It took less and less time. Eventually, my body was in the habit of hearing the alarm and just naturally wanting to get up. I willed it. I set my alarm as late as I could so I couldn't reason with myself- there is no extra time- you set this alarm at the latest possible time to maximize your sleep and have enough time to get ready. Get up!!! It really worked because if I set an alarm at 6:15 and 6:30 and 6:45 instead of just 6:45, I was LOSING 30 minutes of quality sleep so I could lay there like a zombie. You don't actually sleep for 15 minutes. I felt better getting more sleep. 

The hardest part of retraining the way you think or do things is finding a place to start. I did this same thing with studying. If I sit here for an hour putting it off then I'm hungry, then I need a shower, and I took forever to do those things because I'm procrastinating. I just do everything I need to do and get it out the way like eat before studying and grab a coffee and always study in a room that is clean (usually not my house more like a library , coffee shop or school). I need nothing else no excuses then I sit down. Instead of staring at the paper not knowing where to begin I just start anywhere. Class notes, practice test, anything. Eventually I see something I don't understand and I go to the book and read about it and take notes. I keep going until I finish a lesson, chapter etc. I make a list of all the lessons, chapters, assignments etc I need to do and cross them off as I go. This feels so rewarding it drives me to do more- I love the feeling of crossing something off a list. Any negative thoughts I immediately would stop myself mid sentence and redirect. I cross 1/9 off and I don't focus on the 8 I have left and the feeling this will ""never get done"", I stop myself and say wow I finished 10%. I bet I could get 1 more done today, if I do 2 a day the next 3 days, I'll be finished and won't have any studying this weekend. Then I have a goal set I'm speeding through with focus. I might find a few minutes extra here or there through the day to work on that assignment like the extra time I have now before school since I missed traffic or if the teacher is late to class, or if work is slow- then I have less to do when I get home! 

The realization that drives this is time management: if I spend 4 hours putting off studying and 4 hours half heartedly studying, I spent 8 hours today busy and not much time to do much else. If I hadn't procrastinated 4 hours, and really focused and got the same amount done in 2 hours, I could have spent the other 6 hours getting drinks with friends, catching up in school work, or on Netflix doing nothing at all (but not stressing about school!). 

The theme to motivation is finding what makes the most sense for you to do. What is the most efficient way to spend/plan my day. Then tell yourself ""I'll try it"". 100%. Stick to it for a few days. You'll notice things. If I spent 5 minutes packing my lunch the night before, I don't have to wait in line to get food at work for 15-20 minutes making my lunch break longer! Or I finish this assignment tonight, i won't be trying to do a crappy job and working through my lunch to complete it before class. Now you have a happy peaceful lunch! Once I get home after work I'm burnt out for a few hours- once I stop moving I lose momentum. So if I have to go to the grocery I make a list the night before and stop at the store on the way home or maybe pick up to go food. I only got home 30 minutes later  and now I don't have to lay there hungry for 2 hours wondering what's for dinner. Or if I stop at the pharmacy on the way home I don't have to stop and pick up my prescription before work, making myself almost late! 

I wish you the best of luck. I successfully made it through my 4 year degree and working by changing the way I thought and acted and it really changed my life. I had some issues with depression I won't get into and often it was really forced ""fake it till you make it"". It really felt like brainwashing myself into being a morning person, and just a better person in general. But you know what, it worked. And the ability to control my actions and thoughts without relying on bad habits or how I feel in the moment all the time has really improved my quality of life. Outside of being productive, it helped me be more social too. Before I'd miss events that started early because I'd forget, sleep in, not feel like getting up - to things I wanted to go to! Now I know I can do anything. I hope you learn you can do anything too. Sorry to be cheesy but I wish I had realized all of this sooner but at least I figured it out in college and got my degree/career. Sometimes when you're depressed or unmotivated you find yourself in bed, haven't showered for days, with chip crumbs all over your shirt and think ""I want out of this but I don't know how to do it"". Good luck redditor. 
That's true, it required a certain amount of recklessness to even climb into the cockpit. But most of the successful pilots of WWI were very much appreciative of the saying ""discretion is the better part of valor"". The most successful fighter pilots of WWI avoided dogfights where possible, unless conditions were heavily in their favor. And most of the time they would try to sneak up on an unsuspecting enemy pilot, fire a lethal burst and kill him before he was even aware there was danger. 

Roosevelt didn't do that, he'd dive headlong into unfavorable fights, and wouldn't listen to advise of more seasoned comrades.
>you lose the right to run for office

I don't agree with that, depending on the circumstances of the war, but I certainly find being a war hawk after dodging a draft to be wrong because it's patently hypocritical.
It should be contextual of course. A war of aggression is not the same as coming to your countries defence.
How would a draft work if dodging is legal? Yeah being drafted has to suck but the whole system would fall apart of you could just say I'm not going and that's that.

Everyone uses Vietnam as the reason the draft is bad but if we are ever in a situation where we need to defend the country we might need the draft.
I feel the same. I don't having strong feelings against people who dodge or go. I couldn't imagine the stress of having your number called.
>I was a coward, I went to war.
Draft for Vietnam was dumb. Drafts for other wars were necessary like ww2 and the civil war. 
Hell this is the reason many signed up for the military in WW2 as well. Sure there were plenty who joined because of Pearl Harbor, but many joined simply because they could sign their name and suddenly they were a pilot, or in the navy sailing the world. These were kids who could sign their names and become adults. There‚Äôs a lot of great interviews about this in Ken Burns The War documentary.
[deleted]
i'm pretty sure the whole reason those guys are going is because of the chance it'll be a pivotal moment of their existence.  

They obviously don't love their current situation enough to stick around. They would rather go fight another country's unethical war.
[deleted]
Not if hes growing up in the USA and joined the US army its pretty clear where he believes he belongs. And thats ok. America is #1
I'd say I've done pretty well for myself sans a degree. Also, the draft hasn't been active in my lifetime, so, lucked out there too.
Yep, the draft is still a very real thing in the US.  Well, for men, anyways.
Every man in the US gets signed up for selected service when they turn 18. I got mine like 3 days after my birthday. Just have to go online and register. I think the penalty is like $250k and some jail time for not registering. 
Yes, registration for selective service is still required by law.
*Registering* for selective server is a thing, an actual draft hasn't occurred in over four decades *and* it really has no chance of happening short of a full on invasion of US territory (which, lets face it, isn't going to happen).  It was *suggested* in congress during Bush's presidency but that was 100% a political stunt that everyone knew was never going to happen.  
Honestly I'm not mad about it. If the government needs to do a draft again after al these year whatever war must be threatening the homeland in a very real way.
 Maybe he's not saying that for every single possible situation in every conceivable context.  Maybe he's saying it about the post he directly responded to. 
[deleted]
i think that this behaviour also needs to be viewed in the light of the environment it was fought in.

it was the first televised war. you brought war crimes into your family room. no other war had this, it was all written accounts, or carefully cut newsreels.
This specific statement was about what it was like to fight in a war. So yes it was very apolitical. You're an idiot if you can't tell the difference between experiencing combat and an entire country's stance on a war 
Is your argument that the South wasn't worth supporting because it was corrupt?  If that's the case, we should have bailed on South Korea as well since they were a dictatorship until the late 1990's.

However, I would argue that the South Koreans are better off for it even if it took them 40 years to eventually become a democracy.  They would have stood no chance of getting there if the North had taken over.
Fair election?  You think the elections in the North would have been fair?  They had already brutally eliminated any opposition years ago.  
Yup!  Anyone rooting for the North has something seriously wrong with them.  
I said why. Every point I disliked I pointed out and explained, nothing more.
Without a doubt, I'm just saying Vietnam wasn't necessary to facilitate the Soviet's collapse. 
I mean it is sort of stickier then that. It wasn't really the same thing as like today if North Korea invaded South Korea. Vietnam was closer to being in a civil war then two establish countries attacking each other after French Indochina started to fall apart. The north was being backed by communist China so the US backed the south. It was more of a proxy war between communism and capitalism then an ally defending another ally. So I think I still stick by some Canadian volunteering for that war even if they were doing it thinking they were doing good for the South Vietnamese were sort of tricked into thinking the war was really about that.
In comparison to the northern regime it was better. Definitely not perfect 
The hundreds of thousands who died aren't around to voice their disapproval.
True, but who‚Äôs worse: a draft dodger or a person who left a bunch of military guys to die in Benghazi? 
[deleted]
I never said it was a good opinion but the whole equality thing means that each person's opinion is equally valid, no matter how terrible someone else thinks it is.
Why? Because you politically disagree with him. That's a rather poor way to judge someone you've never met
Cue Steve Jobs taking the credit.
What the fuck man
I love you. Seriously. This was the best post about motivation I've ever seen.
Jesus, thanks man.  I mean it.  
he gets it.

currently reprogramming or ""brainwashing"" myself. you can even start with small things.

the book ""the power of habit"" is great at explaining the mechanics of human habits, good or bad and how to create and interrupt them.
Yeah don't think you should ever lose your right to run really
*cough cough*
And even more contextual than that, it could be just as bad if your government deserves it.

If I were a North Korean I sure as hell wouldn't be obligated to defend against Americans.
I have always said that, I don't feel I need to bring freedom to the other side of the globe but if somehow actual foreign troops landed on the US I would volunteer then.
They kinda should have thought about that before? Dont abuse the system or it may become untenable later no matter how much its needed.

But I do agree with you, israel being a decent example of a nation saved a number of times due to compulsory draft. Sometimes draft is needed but that doesnt take away from how immoral/wrong it is.
Not really, it's not the US could've moved it European garrisons to Vietnam
Interesting you confuse soldiering with adulting.

They're not mutually exclusive.
Source? I don't think that's right. Everything I'm finding says Guam is up there, and PR is pretty low. 
At the time, fighting the spread of communism to defend freedom and democracy was *considered* a very noble cause.

EDIT: added a word for clarity 
Depends on your perspective. My family left Viet Nam in '75 and are living well in the states now. Better than the hell hole the communists turned Viet Nam into (and I'm saying this as a pretty liberal person myself). Seems few people comprehend the ""necessary"" in ""necessary evil"".
> The **modern system** of near-universal national conscription

Now try reading pretty much anything else on the page.  Focus on the second sentence.

> America is #1

lol


no mention of sexism brought up there by any chance?
There was a bill that tried to pass Congress back in the very early 20th century, that would have made it so going to war would be a public vote, and if it passed, everyone who voted for, would be draftable. I wish that would have passed.
I never got mine and ironically only signed up when I inquired about enlisting in the military voluntarily
[deleted]
Even in an actual defensive war (which will never and can never happen to begin with), I'd be really surprised to see a draft called. Conscripts make for fantastically shitty soldiers, and modern warfare tactics don't really require many humans anyway.
many would feel alienated though by their homeland and not feel they owe it anything at all.  let alone their lives.

i feel like that. everything goes to the top and fuck those who aren't eton/oxbridge elites (UK). i have my own demons though
So? 
Because choosing to potentially die and kill others for a truly unnecessary war is universally foolish. Some people like jumping off mountains in nothing but squirrel suits. That's foolish too. 
Someone less foolish. 
Lol, it was not a ""life preference."" It was a decision to go halfway across the word to fight an unjust, senseless war for a foreign government. Go take a shower. 
i'm trying to figure out if this is a joke.  like, you're making an odd, overly sensitive argument about offending someone who chooses to fight a war that is not their own. ""let's not hurt their feelings.  we all have life preferences that need to be respected including those who like to go kill people for fun.""
So if you cant see what is reaaly happening its ok?
lol
Probably as fair as it would have been in the South.  Also, what I said isn't a controversial thing.  It is widely accepted fact.  You are demonstrating how little you know about the conflict.
I fail to understand the hidden complexity of this. The North invaded the south correct? Was it wrong to defend the south?
Looks like we're finding out, and the answer may surprise you. 
Lol, the meme conspiracies are strong with this asshole. 
Trump dodged the draft with phony nonsense about bone spurs in his feet. If he supports having that man as president but thinks other draft dodgers should not be allowed to enter the country, that's hypocritical. 
edit: And NO, equality does not mean each person's opinion is equally valid. Where the hell did you hear that? I think it's definition time.

Valid: having a sound basis in logic or fact; reasonable or cogent.

Democracy is not the principle that my ignorance is just as valid and valuable as your knowledge, and objective reality has no value. Criticism of stupid opinions is not anti-democratic. 
If by not valid you mean hypocritical, then yeah, that's what it is. I don't know what else it could mean for an opinion to not be valid, so that is how I answered you question.
Politically disagree and inability to recognize  blatant incompetence are two different things.
I bet he's on adderall to have randomly typed that all out lol
It's okay if you don't agree, but that's how I changed the way I thought and it really changed my life. I couldn't find motivation so I made my own. 
Wow I'm so surprised to see how many people found this in the depths of this post's comments. How awesome to reach several people, I'm glad you got something out of it! Keep on keeping on. 
[deleted]
yeah, at the time. 

Those men didn't know they were being lied to, literally lied to. 

There was staged attack on an American boat that never happened, all used to fuel the war on Vietnam. 
There's still people who believe this cold war trash? Yeah, let's fight an ideology that espouses equality for everyone, while at home we chain our women to kitchens and unleash attack dogs on the minorities... That's freedom and democracy! ...?

It wasn't a noble cause, it was warmongering, empire-building *crap.* :/
> Wikipedia

What the article is saying is conscription has been around for a long time, but the idea of conscripting all abled bodied men between xy - xy age across the whole nation is a relatively new idea, only a couple hundred years ago.
THIS GUY HATES FREEDOM
Canada definitely isnt lol
It's increasingly brought up. The male-only draft was ruled constitutional because only men could serve in combat roles, so it made sense. But they recently changed the rule to allow women to serve in combat roles, so it's on somewhat shaky ground.
Has been something of a topic, of late.
Well for a long time women weren't allowed to serve in combat roles. 
[deleted]
All true, and that ignores the high likelihood of lines of people signing up in that situation negating any need for a draft.
yeah, but then I wouldn't be fighting for the 1% when the commies or whatever are on my doorstep.

Volunteering to fight a war is when someone risks everything they have to fight for something they believe in, even if it‚Äôs for another country. It‚Äôs far from ‚ÄúThose who like to go kill people for fun.‚Äù 
well if you cant see it, you believe the official line - your troops are heros, representing your country and demonstrating your values.

watching naked children flee a napalm, watching buddhist monks set themselves on fire in the middle of the street and burn to death rather than suffer continuing oppression from the ruling catholic minority - which America was propping up.

sure, it wasn't the first war to have atrocities, nor the last, but it was the one that shoved the reality in the face of the stateside public.
America isn't a democracy. And yes it is Democracy is the rule of the 51%, no matter how ignorant they are
Him being hypocritical, if he is since we don't know that he supports Trump, doesn't make his opinion less valid than yours or mine. Being so quick to align someone with someone you dislike and discrediting his point over a hunch is incredibly close minded
That is only your opinion of the man, just because you believe it doesn't make it true
Pretty sure it was Guam or Samoa. The bit was about how shittly we treat them
>There was **staged** attack on an American boat that never happened

No, there wasn't. They definitely lied  and manipulated the situation after it occurred but there's nothing to suggest it was staged or otherwise faked -- There'd be no need to. Incidents like it are a regular occurrence in war and other tense situations. They've occurred throughout history and will continue to occur as long as there is war or conflict. If you've seen Generation Kill, there's an excellent scene which serves as a good parallel.

*while at home we *don't* send MLK to a gulag because he made a speech criticizing politicians


Meanwhile in the egalitarian Soviet Union, a bunch of Estonians have gone on ""vacation"" to Siberia because they asked for self determination 




Thats actually what makes communism worse. Its a lie, its a religion. Communism being egalitarian is structurally impossible. 

For example, would you have police men? Can you have specialization without stratification? Can you have organization without diverse responsibilities? And can you have diverse responsibilities and true equality? 

Are all people equal? Are you going to have mentally disabled biochemical researchers curing cancer? 

Nature itself rebels against equality. The best hope you have is dignity, and its best carved out of the labor and hard work of the smartest people working as hard as they can. The best way to do that is to give them a handful of bonus trinkets, handshakes, and thank yous.

Fuck I don't want a car designed by a mentally disabled person, I don't want heart surgery from a mentally disabled person. Really there are very few ways I want my life impacted by a mentally disabled person. But they deserve dignity and respect. But not equality, nature itself has conspired against them.
I agree, im just saying that fighting communism is what motivated a lot of people to join and fight.
Ok.  How does that make this statement less wrong?

>Conscription is a VERY recent invention. It wasn't really a thing before Napoleon's time.
I never said it was
sounds like it's a house on quicksand.

i bet it's due to the fear of all the paper work if they changed the rules now and all the women had to register too
Downvotes for whining about Downvotes. 
ah yes, i will fight comrade pinko
I‚Äôm perfectly capable of recognizing someone as foolish while still treating them with respect. I do it on a regular basis and others are respectful of my foolishness. Just because your mind goes directly to spitting on others doesn‚Äôt mean everyone‚Äôs does. 
You still haven't refuted how that *isn't* foolish, my dude.
Thanks for confirming that you're a troll. You had us going for a while. 
hmm... nah.  i don't buy it.
That's a nonsequitur. You were referring to democratic values and it was misplaced.

More importantly, you don't seem to know or be willing to learn what the word valid means. 
> Him being hypocritical, if he is since we don't know that he supports Trump, doesn't make his opinion less valid than yours or mine.

Of course it does. Invalid does not mean he doesn't have a right to hold the opinion. Invalid means not cogent, not based in logic or fact.
Okay.
If by Conscription he meant the modern version of conscription, then he's wrong.  

I was replying to your comment above me directly.  Take that as you will.  I sense alot of anger and frustration in your life young padawan.
[deleted]
[deleted]
[deleted]
Maybe valid is the wrong word, how about his right to hold that opinion and his opinion having the same value as yours
Alright that's a fair point. But let me raise another, what if he doesn't support Trump? Would his opinion become valid since it's no longer hypocritical?
How many calories did you burn moving those goalposts back and forth? 
You are right it is rude and I wouldn‚Äôt ever berate a soldier in person by calling them foolish. But that doesn‚Äôt make them any less foolish. 
> They cared, you didn't, and that's fine.

This is the decision to fly across the world to kill people, not picking up laser tag as a hobby. Your inability to distinguish ""preference"" from right and wrong speaks to how fucked-up your moral compass looks.

are you telling me your reason?  or are you inventing reasons for someone else who isn't in the discussion?  if this is for someone else, why are you so worried and arguing?
Yes, you have the right to believe things that are irrational and hypocritical. By pointing out that someone's opinion is irrational and hypocritical, I am merely participating in the public discourse -- ""the free market of ideas."" I don't know why anyone would think I'm doing anything but that.

In fact, I didn't even do that here, because I don't know whether he is being hypocritical or not. I asked him a question, because *if* he holds that opinion while simultaneously supporting Trump then his opinions would be hypocritical. 
So? 
Then his opinions would be consistent. I would still not agree with them, but they would be valid. That is why I asked the question.

Then it seems we are in agreement, I'm sorry that I misinterpreted the underlying meaning of your question.
Huh. So you wouldn‚Äôt consider the Nazi army foolish? Or how about the Japanese army in WW2 who used Kamikaze attacks as a main strategy. Still not foolish? Being a soldier isn‚Äôt a unanimously positive decisions. 
> Why don't you tell John Kerry to his face that his service was a big fat mistake?

""How do you ask a man to be the last man to die in Vietnam? How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake? ""

-- John Kerry , 1971 
Sure, sounds good. Are we supposed to base morality on what would hurt a particular person's feelings? Do you worship a uniform so much that you're unable to decide what's right or wrong for yourself? Is your self-esteem so low that defending the honor of these random people you don't know at all costs overrides any personal morality? 
that's where your whole discussion makes no sense.  you are talking like a hippy about how it is ""insensitive"" to talk about someone's ""life preference"".
Works for me. Have a good one!

[deleted]
The war being the mistake, not the service.
To you as well!
So our soldiers are benevolent but soldiers from other countries are not? Where does that logic come from? You must have not heard of the atrocities committed by American soldiers in Vietnam such as the My Lai massacre. 
I agree with you on both fronts and I would say you did a better job of trumping my argument. Taking into account the time and place at the time these people wouldn‚Äôt be seen as foolish. But looking back on it now it is safe to say with the benefit of hindsight that those people were in fact foolish. 
[deleted]
[deleted]
Ok so now I get how you think. It‚Äôs not foolish to be an AMERICAN soldier and it‚Äôs OK to murder thousands of people because the general IDEA of Vietnam was worth fighting for? Did you even take a history class in school? Vietnam is definitely seen as a pointless war motivated by politics and many of the soldiers who were drafted also felt that way. It would definitely be foolish to volunteer for such a large mistake. 
You don‚Äôt think killing yourself for an emperor is foolish? Would you do that?
[deleted]
[deleted]
Maybe we should start being rude then to deter fools from making foolish decisions instead of blindly supporting pointless military excursions under the guise of honor. It isn‚Äôt honorable to be a modern American soldier. It‚Äôs just a job. I have sympathy for those who were drafted and I feel like those drafted soldiers are true heroes.
I was definitely over-simplifying but that was kind of my point. I think we have grown as humans since that time and can comfortably say that those are not the correct choices. Dying for your beliefs and killing for them are two entirely different things mind you. It‚Äôs not like we view Muslim terrorists as just a product of their culture so they aren‚Äôt foolish. They are definitely foolish and basically along the same lines as my previous example. 
[deleted]
[deleted]
I still think it‚Äôs hilarious that you are fine with the My Lai massacre because you think it‚Äôs just the cost of war but you draw the line at being rude. It must be so entertaining to be in your head. 
Then I personally, respectfully, disagree with you morally. And I see no difference between the two. Both are blindly fighting for what they believe in. What differences are there?
Edit:
Not to mention I don‚Äôt see a difference between anyone who is willing to kill for their beliefs. What makes you any better than the conquistadors or crusaders or Nazi‚Äôs or Muslim terrorists who all killed/kill for what they believe in. I‚Äôm sure they all thought/think what they believe in is the true way much like you I assume do. 
[deleted]
But let‚Äôs not be rude to them. That would be taking it TOO far. 
Edit: 
Here‚Äôs an article that shows just how evil many American soldiers were

http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23427726"
"Review #31, Kilchoman Sauternes",,https://i.redd.it/r01kvclygavz.jpg,"Sample courtesy of u/CalZeta. Hopefully he can fill in some of the specifics about this release such as ABV, age, and whether this is fully aged in Sauternes or just a finish

*****

**Kilchoman Sauternes**

**Nose:** Has what I think of as the standard Kilchoman earthy, burnt rubber peat, a little calmer and smoother than others I've had though. Lots of rich, buttery cake frosting. Little bit of a white wine tickle. It's not a straight up delicious nose, but it's so odd and unique and good that I'm really enjoying it.

**Taste:** Brash earthy peat punch that settles into a creamy sweet undercurrent. Has a thick, BBQ pork and smoke thing going on. Creamy and smoky, like an Octomore. Some nice chocolate and woodiness in there too. I don't think this is cask strength, it drinks really good. I would put it at 50%, it actually drinks like 46-48% but I can't see a Kilchoman release like this being that low.

**Finish:** The wine influence shows up a little more in the finish. It's chocolatey sweet with charred, mouth numbing earthy peat.

*****

This is such an interesting pour. I feel like even though I might have had things I liked more, the uniqueness counts for a lot and makes it enjoyable in it's own way. And honestly it's pretty delicious too. I think this could pass for an Octomore, it has that same meaty, creamy smokiness although it doesn't quite have the hugeness in the mouthfeel. The wine finish is not obvious or in your face at all, and Kilchoman seems really good at melding flavors together into these odd, sometimes delicious creations. This one is very creamy and pretty sweet for a Kilchoman, but I can't say how much of it is the wine. I'm definitely coming around on this distillery though after trying these wine finished expressions. I like to think the age on them is helping too.

Score: **7.5**

1 | Disgusting | So bad I poured it out.

2 | Poor | I wouldn't consume by choice.

3 | Bad | Multiple flaws.

4 | Sub-par | Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.

5 | Good | This is a good, solid daily.

6 | Very Good | A cut above.

7 | Great | Well above average.

8 | Excellent | Really quite exceptional.

9 | Incredible | An all time favorite.

10 | Insurpassable | No better exists.
Yes on mobile app
Unrelated to your post but what‚Äôs the chimp poster in the background?
Nice review man. This sounds amazing. I'm a sucker for Sauternes aged whisky. I think I'll have to pick up a bottle.
Sorry man. It's early. Full maturation. I'm glad it's Friday.
Are you sure you scored this correctly?  Your review sounded positive- the score was no better than Horsepiss.
Did you try the Loch Gorm sample? If yes, hows it compared to this?
Nice review, this sounds delicious.

I believe Kilchoman always does full maturation, never any finishing.
I'm not sure why people use mobile when I hear about all the problems it seems to have. Standard Reddit seems easy enough to use on my phone.
It's an old ad for a rum or liqueur or something, makes for a cool poster. I got it from my dad. Anisetta I think
Thanks. This was delicious, but really not like any other wine finished Scotch I've had. Such a unique distillery.
I guess you didn't read his scoring guide
I think I ranked it higher than horsepiss. But yeah, I always have trouble scoring so don't pay too much attention to it. I guess I just didn't wanna commit to an 8.
I didn't, I wish I had as a sbs though. Loch gorm is sherried right? 

Do you have the specs on the sauternes bottle?
I got you mixed up with CalZeta earlier, that's why I asked you about the Sauternes Cask. I just drank the Loch Gorm, it was really good but I would rank it below both the wine finished Kilchomans I've tried recently. Honestly though it may just be the lower proof hurting it, because it's delicious. I'm surprised it's only 46%, for the price I regularly see it at($80-$90) I just figured it was a Cask Strengther. I really didn't get much sherry from it, I would have figured it for a standard peated Whisky. It had that creamy, buttery feel to it that this one had, I'm really loving it. 

And btw, here's the pic you had asked for. I never posted a review or anything because you asked me not to reveal the mystery sample: https://imgur.com/gallery/XVTVD
Thanks, and it was. That's interesting, they're really good at melding all these flavors into a cohesive Whisky.
Thanks

I got it, it's ""full term maturation"" vs short term finishing. When in doubt, got to their website. Sounds really good.
I‚Äôm not sure what you mean- a 1.5 is barely above pouring it out.  His whole description seems to be about how uniquely enjoyable it is.  Like a 6-7 level at least.  Anyways I generally enjoy a Sauternes cask.
Yes, Loch Gorm is sherried. Aged for 7-8 years.

I didn't purchase sauternes cask bottle because of the cost. I believe its apprx 5 year old (distilled 2011, bottled 2016), 50% ABV
Pics looks great! I think its ok to post a review now. I have already sent out couple of more samples from that bottle.
Thanks for the info, I did not know that
I'm not sure, I was waiting for u/CalZeta to chime in on the bottle specs, but another reply mentioned that Kilchoman generally does full maturation.
The score says 7.5...
Thanks for the info. T had a feeling it wasn't Cask strength, it drank wonderfully. And yes, I consider the price on these to be prohibitive, especially when I can't try them first since I've had some bad bottles.
Sorry week's been hectic and I totally forgot to respond here.

Yes, all Kilchoman casks are fully matured in their barrels, with the exception of Machir Bay and Sanaig, which are blends of bourbon matured and sherry matured whiskies. 

This one was distilled in 2011 and bottled in 2016, so at least 4 years, maybe 5 years old. And you were right, the ABV is at 50%.
So strange- the score reads 1.5 on my phone.  I‚Äôd screenshot it to show you, but I don‚Äôt know how to share pics on Reddit,
There's some error on mobile with bold text and numbers, someone commented similarly on my reviews.
Cool Thanks. I think you succeeded in changing my mind on Kilchoman. It looks like I just got unlucky with a few bad barrels before. Or maybe they're just getting better with age like we talked about before.

"Review #27, Whistle Pig 10 K&L Single Barrel",,https://i.redd.it/2i5a13z4t9uz.jpg,"**Whistle Pig 10 Single Barrel, K&L pick, barrel 15-59, 56.6%**

**NOSE:** Warm and friendly. Vanilla and creamy Rye with delicious baking spice and cinnamon. Maple richness, clean toasted wood.

**TASTE:** Caramel and easygoing rye spice, gingerbread kind of pastry wholesomeness. More light, unobtrusive cinnamon and baking spice kind of tingling the senses in the background. There's a dark sweetness to it too, nothing quite as strong as cherry cough syrup, but in that vein. Dark vanilla and toasted oak.

**FINISH:** Continues with the smooth, warm and friendly character. Chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and mellow Rye, leaves with nice toasted oak. Kind of a short yet pleasant finish.

*****

I'll admit this isn't always the profile I'm looking for in a Rye. It's rich and smooth with a creamy warmth, and I tend to prefer a brighter, sharper, and spicier kicker of a Rye. But there's just no denying how delicious this is, and it really grew on me. It's so damn drinkable at the proof too, it just does what it does so well. I feel like this would have been a perfect winter dram, something to sip on while sitting in front of the fire. It's dark and sweet and thick, it tastes like some kind of Christmas pastry and the friendly baking spice is very comforting and inviting. It got me through the summer just fine though, and I would totally do it again. This is Rye done right.

The first batch of releases had the store name on the larger, front label.  Later releases had it on a separate, smaller tag above the larger label.  I've wondered whether the earlier batches were more likely better barrels. Particularly, since, at the price, demand didn't catch on until earlier purchasers found they were better than the regular 10/100 version.
I tend to think of Whistle Pig 10 as rye heavy bourbon 
I've got a Whistle Pig SiB too that has a lot of these creamy vanilla notes and is lighter on the spice IMO. Definitely not what I was expecting or hoping for initially but I ended up real pleased with the bottle. 

Nice review, cheers!
Sounds delicious - How old is this bottle?? 

Very nice review! Agree, it's not the mgp into your face rye. Its more vanilla driven and balanced. I really like those ryes! 
I couldn't tell you what label the others I've tried were since they were samples, but I've enjoyed them all. Blows my mind that these store picks don't even cost much more than the standard 10yr. Unfortunately that's not because they're cheap, just that the standard 10yr is pretty expensive
It's a 100% Rye mashbill, do you mean the flavor? I've had some pretty different flavor profiles from them granted, but all very much Rye, and delicious.
That's exactly how it went with this bottle. I didn't hate it or anything, but it wasn't really what I was hoping for after trying a really spicy Rye kicker barrel before it. But it just kept getting better as time passed and as I drank it. In the end it won me over :)
I can't wait to try it soon when another 1-2 SiB arrive to do a little lineup. 
I think they had it around the holidays last year
Thanks! Im enjoying opening up to new whiskeys and watching my tastes change with the help of excellent bottles like this.
I was just referring to the flavor.   I was fortunate enough to grab a bottle for $55 the day after the distiller did an event at a liquor store near my house"
"Review #30, Signatory Glenlivet 9",,https://i.redd.it/tzrl7j3bmosz.jpg,"Sample courtesy of u/bpnelson7

*****

**2006 Glenlivet 9yr, Signatory Un-Chillfiltered, first fill sherry butt, 46%**

**Nose:** Rich malt with caramel and toffee, green apple that I swear I wasn't looking for but recognized right away. The sherry influence is light and pleasant, some berry sweetness and tart fruit

**Taste:** Big, clean sweetness. The sherry influence is minimal here, it tastes like a malt-bomb. Rich, almost gritty caramel malt, some light and playful fruitiness. More of that lightly tart green apple. Very pleasant.

**Finish:** Finish simply continues on with the delicious, sweet caramel maltiness. It darkens into a burnt, rich caramel fruitiness that is just delicious.

*****

This is a bare bones Scotch of sweet, rich maltiness. If I tasted this blind I would have guessed only lightly sherried based on the nose, but then I would have quickly doubted myself once I tasted it. It's everything I look for in a malt bomb Scotch, creamy and rich and sweet with big caramel maltiness. And I guess the sherry influence doesn't do much more than add just that hint of rich and dark fruit that kicks it up a notch. The green apple note, which is a big part of the standard 12yr for me, presented itself very quickly in the nose which I got a big kick out of. And I swear I wasn't even looking for it, but there it was!

The standard Glenlivet 12 was my first single malt love many years ago, so I was really looking forward to trying this. But that being said, I feel totally unbiased when I say this is leaps and bounds beyond the OB bottles and quite delicious.

Good review, pretty spot on with the notes. Does not even remotely feel like a first fill sherry cask (I posited a theory of re racking in my review), way beyond the OB 12 year old. 
Like it may have been switched to a ff sherry butt later, and not spent it's full 9 years in one? From what I recall there is no law about keeping track of that kind of stuff, and it wouldn't surprise me based on the flavor. Surely it wouldn't be difficult for them to just put ""sherry finish"" on the label as many OB's do though. That would actually be a selling point for someone like me, I love a refill butt or sherry finish.
Correct. The outturn was basically the max volume of a butt so it seems it was simply finished in one for a brief time. 
That's pretty interesting about the barrel yield, along with the light profile it certainly does make you think. I wouldn't think they would have any reason to be shady about it though, an IB Livet would be pretty attractive whatever way it was aged. Maybe they felt it wasn't aging well and needed a little help from a sherry barrel before being bottled young? I honestly don't know how these things work. All I know is this stuff is delicious."
"Review #29, Kilchoman Bordeaux single cask",,https://i.redd.it/140rfpopjxqz.jpg,"From what I could gather this was aged entirely in a Bordeaux red wine cask, not sure on the age but I imagine it's 5-6 years. Big thanks to u/CalZeta who took it upon himself to convince me that Kilchoman has lots to offer despite my bad experiences with some of their Whiskies.

*****

**Kilchoman Single Barrel Bordeaux , 60.3%**

**Nose:** Very smooth, brooding nose. Earthy peat and thick smoked meat bbq. Slight iodine. Chocolate, rich caramel and vanilla along with dark, syrupy sweetness and a winey twang. 

**Taste:** So thick and heavy. Not the harsh, exciting brashness I'm used to with Kilchoman. The presence is just huge in the mouth, like a dark explosion. Big caramel maltiness with sticky sweet dark cherry. Clean peat with rich vanilla. Tart fruit and some slight menthol kick in the background.

**Finish:** A very long, heavy finish. Bright dark cherry sweetness that darkens into caramel and ashy peat. Leaves very sweet and earthy without heavy peatiness.

*****

This isn't like any Kilchoman I've had before. All the ones I've tried have had this jarring, harsh vibe to them with a strong, burnt rubber peatiness quality to them. If they had anything going for them it's that they were proudly proclaiming their youth with strong, exuberant flavors that were all over the place. This on the other hand tastes like a mature, well aged Scotch. The peat is definitely there but it's very clean and understated, it broods in the background under a layer of rich oak, dark wine and malt. The wine influence adds a thick, dark sweetness that permeates it all but never dominates. If I had tasted this blind I might have actually guessed a port finish. As someone who hasn't been a huge fan of Kilchoman, I am impressed and pleasantly surprised.

[Here's a pic with the bottle details.](https://imgur.com/ou3eQv2) It's only ~4.5 years old! 

I'm glad that you liked this one... I was actually wondering a few days ago about how you felt about the two samples I sent you. I know different strokes for different folks, but I really do feel they've put out some exceptional whiskey for being as new to the Scotch scene as they are, and competing with such established powerhouses such as Lagavulin, Laphroaig, and Ardbeg. 

As I type this, I'm working my way through and writing down notes for the mystery sample you sent me... I'll post that tonight or tomorrow.
Loved this dram so much.  Lots of jammy berries, thick.  Sent me scrambling for kilcho wine matured single casks.  Ended up with a great sherry, but it was a level below this guy.

They are doing their LE this year with some type of Portuguese wine casks.  Can't wait to try it
Well like I said, this is such a different beast from all the other kilchomans I've tried. Very smooth, rich and drinkable.

And don't worry, even if I don't post a review I usually reply with my thoughts. Looking forward to hearing about the mystery sample, and to trying the Sauternes Kilchoman next.
K&L?
Thick is definitely a good word for it. Of the 5 or 6 Kilchomans I've tried this is by far my favorite. I still wouldn't buy any Kilchoman without trying it first, and even then it would pry be a pass with the prices.
Did someone say smooth
The Kilchoman Sauternes is quite exceptional too.  Had it in a bar and was compelled to pick up a bottle.
Yes.
At least it's not elegant
Tastes smooth, no‚Äî*smells* smooth, yes?
Sweet. Thanks. It must be the same bottling I have in my stash. Can't wait.
That's what they say about your mom!"
Now that's a Macallan I can get behind,,https://i.redd.it/ecvhqtyx9fqz.jpg,"Cask strength, vintage statement, plus cheaper than most Macallan OBs? I can see why.
[Bonus gallery of some more raw casks](https://imgur.com/gallery/BBBuy)
nonserious question, why would you buy this and not the Macallan Rare Cask ^^TM
Yes please. 
Where are you?  I wish I had more access to blackadder. 
. Would I pay that much for an original Macallan CS? No. Would I pay that much for a OB 1990 CS, bourbon aged  Macallan? Maybe. Would I take a chance on this one?  This one I might take a chance on. I really like Blackadder raw cask bottlings and you just don't see that many IB of Macallan, plus it's an older Macallan. It just might be amazing. I can rationalize anything, esp scotch.
Noooooo thanks.
And Bourbon barrel mac sounds pretty cool to me.
That clynelish ....drool
Nonserious answer: sometimes poor people need fancy scotch to impress their friends too, so they have to resort to these cheaper bootleg bottles. So sad.
I'm in California, but it's certainly not something I see a lot of out here. Other than this store I've only seen a couple bottles before, both Raw Casks.
I know, it's tempting right? I had a Bourbon barrel aged macallan IB once, it was delicious. Funny thing is that even though it was a blind tasting as a mystery sample, I thought it was sherried, go figure.

I've never spent that much on a bottle, but I'm sure I've spent that much in one trip on several bottles before, so is this much worse?
Yeah, I had my eye on that one too.
Had a 15yr Blackadder Clynelish, was amazing.

Actually all Blackadder bottles are amazing ime.
Well it gives me a boner. I would buy that clynelish and tomatin. Thanks for sharing
Same here. Hard to spend that much on on bottle. In the end, I'd pass."
"Review #28, Balblair 21 Blackadder Raw Cask",,https://i.redd.it/posjnmhugppz.jpg,"Raw Cask is an interesting line put out by Blackadder that is bottled directly from the cask without any kind of filtering, resulting in bits of wood and barrel char floating around the bottle.

Needless to say it is also non chill filtered and no color added.

*****

**1990 Balblair 21, Blackadder Raw Cask, refill sherry, 56.4%**

**Color:** [1.4](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg), dark and alluring.

**Nose:** Thick, luscious and fruity sherry with no must or sulphury sick sweetness. Warm strawberry and orange, creamy pastry and custard maltiness. The nose is huge, warm, and comforting,and it just smells like dessert.

**Taste:** The warm and fruity creaminess of the nose wakes up and comes alive on the palate. Thick, creamy Balblair maltiness and a slightly bright and bitter kind of berry note that keeps things interesting. Mellows out dark and smooth with warm strawberry and chocolate. It's not huge and heavy or too light and subtle, it just kind of glides along in a creamy, easygoing way. 

**Finish:** The flavor suddenly explodes with a bright, sweet tartness and ridiculously thick maltiness that quickly darkens into warm vanilla and chocolate, leaves with a delicious root beer char.

*****

This is a very complex Whisky that is constantly morphing in nature from nose to flavor to finish. It's got lots of smooth sherry warmth, creamy maltiness, tartness, and brighter sweetness. And that dark gritty char it leaves you with is delicious. I would describe it as root beer or black liquorice, it's such a unique flavor and I always love it in a Scotch. I don't know if that char note necessarily has anything to do with the bits of barrel char floating in the bottle, but it's definitely a nice flavor to go along with the visual. And as someone who isn't huge on sherried Scotch, I feel like the sherry influence is perfectly done here. It has all the fruity warmth and chocolate without the overload of funky wine and sulphur. I often find a refill sherry barrel or just a sherry finish is the right amount of sherry for me, it doesn't overwhelm the Scotchy maltiness, but rather adds another layer of enjoyment. It does all that quite well here. The finish is the only complaint I have, it's eventful with really interesting and delicious flavor but feels quick and ends kind of abruptly. Definitely leaves me wanting more, which isn't such a bad thing I guess until I ran out.

"Review #27, Mystery Sample",,https://i.redd.it/uqqsev3rgioz.jpg,"Mystery sample courtesy of u/CalZeta

*****

**Nose:** Briny and phenolic, deep yet clean peatiness. Sweet citrus and musty funk. This is powerful but not big, it has a sharpness to it.

**Taste:** Clean, briny peat. Sweet maltiness with some burnt vanilla and chocolate. The nose almost had me thinking a wine finish with the sweetness and the funk, but now I don't think so.

**Finish:** Darker, toasted wood and chocolate, leaves with lightly sweet char and peat

*****

This is delicious. It tastes like an Islay peat bomb but it has a very clean, precise nature that makes it kind of interesting. The Abv is difficult to guess too. It has pretty big flavor and I don't think it's lower than 46% but it tastes like it could be a very drinkable CS in the low 50's. I'm leaning towards one of the many Ardbeg releases I haven't tried yet, but it also reminds me a lot of Lagavulin 12 CS so...

**Guess:** Lagavulin 12CS

**Reveal:** [Battlehill Bunnahabhain 4 year heavily peated, 58.0%](/spoiler)

You kind of expect to be surprised by mystery drams, people throw weird IB's and odd finishes at you, but I still managed to be pretty surprised by this. I'm not sure if the sharpness and clean sweetness is a result of the young age, but I wouldn't call it brash or young tasting. I even seem to have gotten some darker char and wood flavor, although now I'm wondering if it was just young peatiness. And I'm usually pretty good at guessing ABV, but this was so drinkable it really threw me off. I never even added water. I've never had any peated Bunna to compare this to, but I liked it and I wanna try some more.

Great review and it does sound interesting.  I've been enjoying the peated Bunnahabhains more recently.  The Moine bottling (for the Swedish market) is an amazing value.
Hey Buckydean, I agree completely with your review. I bought the 4,6, and 8 yo Battlehill Bunnahabhains from Ace Spirits to round out my order of their low priced Talisker Storm and Distillers Edition (to save on cost of postage per bottle) and I really enjoy these almost as much as I enjoy IB Ledaig or Bowmore. I have an inexperienced palate but the 4 has the most intense peat, the 6 a little less and the 8 has a great sweetness similar to some of the Benrinnes from KL. I think a lot of these Battlehill releases would get pretty good reviews if tasted blind.
Nice review. Sounds like something I'd like to try.
Never knew there was a 4YO bunna offering! Thanks for the review.

BTW, the picture in background is interesting.
Thanks man. It would seem hard with all the distilleries on Islay to get a unique peated Whisky, but this one pulled it off. The combination of phenolic/medicinal and brine was really throwing me off. I don't get as much brine from Laphroaig or medicinal from Ardbeg, that's mainly why I guessed Laga12. Have other peated Bunna's been like that for you?

And I think I can get a bottle of this one I reviewed, so if I grab one maybe another swap will be in order.
So are they all peated and cask strength?
Yeah, this has got to be the youngest single malt I've drank, I don't think Octomore even does 4yr. And I enjoy that poster and that angle for review pics.
Huh, no, actually I don't get much of a medicinal character at all from the peated Bunnas I've tried.  Which is one of the things I really like about it.  Plenty of brine though.  Laga 12 isn't really that far off from some of them though.


I have the Moine and the Feis Ile 2017 bottling which is peated and finished in Oloroso barrels (and its fantastic).  Another trade at some point would be fun.
All cask strength but I don't think the 8 year is peated."
"Reviews #4 & 5, Crown Royal 1975 vs modern",,https://i.redd.it/wadd4krwbwnz.jpg,"A side by side review of a modern Crown Royal mini and a 2 oz sample of standard Crown Royal from 1975. Full disclosure the 1975 Crown Royal has been unsealed for who knows how long, but the fill level was decent as seen here: https://i.imgur.com/LKe4VfA.jpg

Big thanks to u/brenttw for the 1975 sample. He graciously sent me a sample for free after I expressed some interest in it, just to see what I think of it.

*****

**Modern Crown Royal, 40%**

**Nose:** Pretty weak nose. There's some ""standard issue"" sweet caramel, butterscotch, fruitiness, and weak Rye. There's a funky plastic with ethanol burn though that's kind of off putting. Besides that though it's not a horrible nose, but it's weak and lacks any punch.

**Taste:** Watered down like the nose. Caramel sweetness, light cinnamon, and ethnanol burn. More of that weird, burnt plastic kind of note. It doesn't overwhelm it and ruin it necessarily, but it's definitely there.

**Finish:** Sweet with cinnamon and ethanol burn. Yikes.

*****

**1975 Crown Royal, 45%**

**Nose:** Delicious and vibrant fruitiness jumps out of the glass. Maple sweetness and a green apple kind of twang, like a caramel apple. Quite nice, and a stark contrast to the weak and weird nose on the modern version.

**Taste:** Grain alcohol, a rich fruitiness with sweet and creamy caramel. It's richer and more vibrant than the modern version. It still has the weird burnt plastic note that I recognize as a Crown Royal feature, but it's not as prominent or gross as the modern version. Overall it falls a little flat after the yummy nose though.

**Finish:** maple rich sweetness with some astringent ethanol burn

*****

The modern crown royal, which I haven't drank in quite a long time, isn't quite as bad as I remember-but almost. It's drinkable, in the context of being at a party where someone busts it out like it's the good stuff. I certainly wouldn't pay for it, or willingly drink it if there was almost anything else around, but I can shoot it in good fun. It's sweet and drinkable except for some kinda gross burnt plastic flavor and mild ethanol burn.

I know it's kind of a cliche with ""dusty"" Whiskey that older=better, but the 1975 really is better to me. It's richer, fruitier, and more vibrant than it's modern counterpart, with less of the off putting flavors. Even though it's still 40%, it's got a much better mouthfeel too. It doesn't have as much of that ""watered down"" quality the modern version has. The flavor and smell kind of jumps out at you whereas you're really searching for it with the modern version. I'm not gonna sit here and try to say the stuff is amazing or anything though. It's still kind of a flat, boring, and one dimensional Whiskey with some unpleasant flavor, but drinking it side by side with a modern version was a lot of fun and really makes it come alive.

Awesome review! thanks for doing that comparison, and thanks for the swap!
Yeah man, so I don't think you need to worry about your bottle, it's as good as...well, as good as it ever was. The unpleasant parts of it could have maybe been caused by the bit of extra oxidation from it being open, but for all I know the extra air might have mellowed it for the better too.

It's actually got some good stuff going on, certainly more than the modern version, and it is interesting if nothing else. You may be able to use it up on sample swaps with other curious people like me.
good to know, thanks man! ya i wasnt super impressed with it when I tried it but really havent had a modern day crown in forever. "

Every human, ever, is in this picture.
‚ÄúLook again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world.

No i don't think so, if you zoom in on it you'll see a small smudge of pixels next to earth on the right, I think that's the moon
>Earth, which is 898 million miles (1.44 billion kilometers) away in this image, appears as a blue dot at center right; the moon can be seen as a fainter protrusion off its right side.

Here's a higher res photo where you can just make out a smudge on the right side of the earth

that's no moon!
20 years.  the Cassini probe was 20 years old.
I don't think NASA copyrights these images, so you most certainly could.
This picture isn't ""The Pale Blue Dot"".

This is ""The Day Earth Smiled"".
The rings are not that close to the probe in this picture, honestly. An astronomer can probably chime in here with more details, but the rings are still pretty far away. Iirc, the rings are about 175k miles away from Saturn (about 3/4 the distance from the Earth to the moon.)

It's hard to put perspective on these things, because the distances involved are so huge. Saturn has a diameter of 72k-ish miles. This picture is off to one side of Saturn, below the rings that are themselves 175k miles away from Saturn. The probe is probably at *least* as far away as half the distance between the Earth and moon from the rings here- probably further. That's only close by astronomical standards.
Well you know what they say, the atmosphere adds an extra ten pounds.  
I thought it was the bottom view.

Thanks man. 
This is correct...at least that's how it's annotated on the NASA website.
It has to be a lot farther away though, since all planets of the solar system fit in between earth and moon. 
Holy fuck theres a giant arrow thats about to hit earth.
True. Thinking Voyager 1
I'm aware, but i reminded me of it
I see. How close would you have to be for them to stop looking like that?
Had to look it up:
>The total weight of the atmosphere exerts a pressure of about 14.7 pounds per square inch at sea level.
That's a great picture, I've liked [this one](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Saturn_eclipse.jpg) for a while too.
Except that the distance to the moon is roughly 400000km, and the distance to Saturn when the earth and Saturn are at the closest point is about 1.2 Billion km, so I would be quite surprised if the moon was actually that far away on the photo
Depending on where the moon was in it's orbit when this pic was taken, it might be slightly in front of or behind the earth, so they'd overlap.
Is this an artist impression because it seems too beautiful to be real, source please?
I think that he/she is trying to say is that if you put all the planets aligned side by side, they would fit between the earth and moon.

"Review #26, Dalmore 12",,https://i.redd.it/gkg6r8s4jkjz.jpg,"Sample courtesy of u/MonsieurZaccone

*****

**Dalmore 12, 40%**

**Nose:** Funky and musty right off the bat, not horrible but not totally pleasant either. Once the off-putting notes wear off orange and fruity malt shine through, slight chocolate, some bitter wood.

**Taste:** Funk is still there but not as strong as the nose. I'm guessing it's just a sherry influence which doesn't always work for me. Very weak and watered down flavors of sweet caramel, mild fruitiness and rich wood, some very mild spice.

**Finish:** Not much of a finish to speak of, some sweetness and plain jane caramel

*****

Not an amazing pour, but not awful. There's some decent flavor here and it has a nice, mildly rich sherry influence that doesn't go overboard(which is exactly how I like my sherry), but it's obviously hurt by the low ABV. It just has kind of a weak, watered down mouthfeel. If this were in a lower tier price range it would totally be worth having on my shelf as a cheap go-to, since I would pry rate it a notch above things like Livet/Speyburn 12. It occupies a slightly darker and richer realm than the cheap Glen 12's too which is nice. But when you consider that bottles like Laphroaig 10, Macallan 12, Ledaig 10, and Bunnahabhain 12 go for as much or less than this, there's just no comparison. 

Score: **5**

this line 100x times. i bought a bottle on sale for $51 USD just to try it. it isnt bad but i havent finished it either.
People that like this tell me it's not that bad.

But no one who's reviews I trust actually likes this.

Go figure.
It's really not bad for what it is, it's just overpriced Imo. I tend to not always be a big fan of sherried scotch too, so the funky sherry notes along with the low abv just kind of turned me off."
"Reviews #24-26, OESK side by side",,https://i.redd.it/2jdyicr5j5jz.jpg,"A side by side of three different OESK recipe Four Rose Single Barrel store picks. They all happen to be right around 10 years old too. One is a bottle I have, and the other two are samples courtesy of u/sirabra and u/Nm0369.

*****

**(A) Hitime OESK, 10yr 1mo, 59%**

**Nose:** Mellow creamy chocolate with sweet orange and cherry. Invigorating menthol and spice. Rich toasted brown sugar oakiness rounding it all out. A beautiful, rich nose.

**Taste:** Cherry cough syrup sweetness, delicious cereal, deeeep toasted oakiness, and strong yet cleanly refined spice. Some light chocolate but not a much as the nose had. All woven together so seamlessly that I find it very difficult to pick apart. This has much smoother toasted oak than others I've had though and the spice is less ""kick"" and more refreshing mintiness or menthol.

**Finish:** Rich brown sugar and mild spice peak very quickly, leaves sickly sweet and minty with crisp toasted oak.

*****

**(B) Ledger Liquors OESK, 9yr 11mo, 55.1%**

**Nose:** Light, creamy chocolate again with coffee and rich toasted brown sugar. Rich, smooth oakiness that is a bit toned down and mustier compared to (A). Some menthol that is very well integrated overall, but not much of the spice the (A) had. Smooth and creamy with an interesting little nip of menthol.

**Taste:** The cherry cough syrup sweetness comes in but is much friendlier and mellower than (A). Sweet, smooth toasted brown sugar. More of that creamy chocolate richness.

**Finish:** Mouth numbing cherry sweetness balanced by chocolate and toasted barrel char. Rides out dark and sweet.

*****

**(C) Rural Inn OESK, 10yr 4mo, 54.9%**

**Nose:** Creamy and reserved, the oak dominates here compared to the other two. It's still not an overbearing or overly sharp woodiness, but rather a thick and creamy musty wood. Chocolate and dark cherry with faint clove spice kind of lurking under the elegant surface

**Taste:** Big, DARK cherry sweetness with a deep oaky twang, the creamy chocolate bringing it all together. This builds much bigger and stronger than the reserved and elegant nose led me to believe, I love it. Everything melds together into a dark, rich creamy wave.

**Finish:** It builds to a bright cherry toasted sweetness but leaves dark and chocolatey.

*****

All three of these are winners. And unlike another single recipe sbs I did, all three of these are remarkably similar in character. According to the cheat sheet OESK is summed up as ""spicy, full body."" But that doesn't seem accurate describing these, the unifying theme for me was the milk chocolate creaminess and dark, rich woodiness(although A is a little lighter on the creamy chocolate and heavier on the spice). I would characterize all of these as smooth, creamy, and well balanced, no one flavor dominates and jumps out at you. They're not super bright or super dark and rich, but have a very nice and interesting interplay between bright and dark flavors. And even though my favorite FRPS's in the past have been the really bright, fruity and floral, spicy kickers, I must say these work really well. None of them really ""wowed"" me, but I've found that even an average FRPS is still a well above average bottle of Bourbon.

Overall I'd say (A) is the spiciest and more dynamic of the three, (B) is definitely the sweetest, and (C) is the oakiest and darkest. My Hitime bottle wins out easily, and the two samples are both really good with (B) having the slight advantage since I tend more towards brighter and sweeter and it had the nicest finish. But the dark, oaky richness is still very well executed in (B). A lovely bunch of pours.

**Score:**

(A) **7.5**

(B) **7**

(C) **7**

Nice review!  Sample C is from the Rural Inn here in Indianapolis.
I've found myself drawn to the higher proof private selects; I think for my palate the higher proof (indicative of being placed in some warmer sections of the rickhouse) tends to bring out spicier, more complex flavors. It's splitting hairs as they all tend to be good, but picks at >120 proof catch my eye.
Thanks, I edited my post. And thanks again for the sample, it was fun doing the side by side.
I've actually noticed this too, some of my favorites have been higher proof, regardless of age or recipe. I find they usually don't need water either. I've certainly had some outstanding lower proof bottles too, but the success rate of 60%+ just seems higher.
I'm curious to see what you think of that WTKS I sent you.  Any plans to crack that one open?
Probably not any time soon, I have too much stuff open right now and I seem to drink really slow. I'll get to it eventually though, that one's definitely not gonna be going anywhere. You swapped a few out didn't you? I could pry get a sample from someone, or if you wanna do another swap."
Moisture barrier with new siding question,"I'm having new siding put up on the weather side of my house , since the old T1-11 is too far gone to just paint over. I'm gonna have horizontal cottage lap but up over the old T1-11, and the contractor said he would also put up a layer of moisture barrier underneath the new siding, sounds good to me. 

But now another contractor I was talking to said you shouldn't add a second moisture barrier when the original is still in the wall, since moisture then gets trapped between the two layers and starts rotting and causing problems. This actually makes a lot of sense to me, it sounds legit. But all of the contractors I had come out for a quote suggested the same new moisture barrier under the new siding. So I'm not sure what to think. My question is should I get the moisture barrier or not? And if I decide not to, does that mean the contractor should drop his quoted price since there's less materials?

The house was built in the mid 80's, I'm only assuming it has an original moisture barrier based on the date of construction. I'm in central Ca mountains that sees high desert dryness/heat in the summer but cold, windy and snowy conditions in the winter. Like real windy, we have windfarms here. Thanks!

EDIT: Also, the front of my house appears to have already had new cottage lap put up over existing T1-11 before I ever owned it. If two layers of moisture barrier is a problem, should I be worried about whether this was done on the front? Thanks again!",https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/6wlt2n/moisture_barrier_with_new_siding_question/,"You should determine one way or another if there is an existing moisture barrier. 
In general, you don't want to have 2 vapor barriers in a wall.  It can cause rot/mold issues because you are trapping any moisture between those areas.  It is probably fine to install a weather barrier like Tyvek over the existing siding though. 
A vapor barrier should let moisture out, but keep it from coming back into the house. Look into Henry Blueskin or a Typar product, but steer clear of Tyvek as (I don't believe) it allows moisture to escape the building's envelope
Always go with the manufacturers instructions. Always.
What would be the best way to see? From the inside or outside, or up in the attic? I would guess maybe just drilling a large hole between studs. 

And do you agree then that a second barrier should not be added if there is already one there? And if there isn't a barrier there already, is it even a big deal if it's gone all this time without one?
So there's a difference between vapor barriers and weather barriers? I have to find out what exactly he planned on installing.
Thanks for the input, I wanted some info like this to discuss with the contractor before I talked to him again."

"Review #23, A Midwinter Nights Dram 4.4",,https://i.redd.it/bwg5ounhclfz.jpg,"According to the bottle label, this is High West Rendezvous Rye that has been finished in both Port and French oak barrels. Also I read once that they intentionally make it 49.3% so that the proof is 98.6, the same as the internal temperature of the human body.

*****

**High West ""A Midwinter Nights Dram,"" Act 4 Scene 4, 49.3%**

**Color:** [1.7](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg), I love the impossibly rich color on wine finished Whiskies. 

**Nose:** The Rye and heavy port finish hit together beautifully. Creamy Rye spice and cinnamon interwoven with silky smooth fruity richness and mildly tart sweet berry. None of it jumps out and smacks you in the face, just glides along soft but huge.

**Taste:** Starts off with toasted wood and rich winey fruit, morphs into bright Rye with brown sugar sweetness and warm baking spices. There's a little bit of toned down Rye dill in there too, but it melds nicely with all the rich flavor. Warm and toasty, it embraces and envelopes me in a way American Whiskey rarely does.

**Finish:** Sweet burnt brown sugar and pepper with Rye baking spice goodness. Leaves you with an elegant, rich sweetness.

*****

Despite the morphing flavors of Elegant richness and sweet Rye it manages to be kind of monotone, but in a comforting, velvety smooth way. I'm reminded of the sagely words of one u/slanderousu, who told me in one of my reviews that he always reads ""elegant"" as ""boring."" And I have indeed had a complicated relationship with this dram, sometimes it is just kind of overly port influenced and boring to me. But really diving in and analyzing it reveals the brighter, spice-y rye notes that really make this interesting. I still feel like I'm not quite as big of a fan of this as many around here though. I will say it definitely tastes like Christmas, and all the warm, comforting things we associate with the season while fending off the cold winter outside.

Score: **7** for my personal enjoyment level, but honestly this is more of an 8 for sheer craftsmanship.

Great review! MWND is one of my favorite all time drams. I don't know why, though, I did not like the sample of 4.4 I had near as much as other releases 
Really enjoyed this review.  My take on this is similar.  I like what you said about ""elegant"" which I don't think means ""boring"".  A really well crafted whiskey should be elegant (dare I say smooth), it shouldn't just be fire, heat and maxed flavor.  It's an integration of component flavors in a complimentary way so that it's balanced.  That's what I think this has, and what I think elegant means.


Thanks. I tried a sample of Act 2, but it was quite a while before I got this bottle and I don't remember how they compared. 
I think elegant is a certain kind of profile, some are certainly more ""elegant"" than others. I dunno, language falls short sometimes but I think I like your explanation. What I think of as elegant can also be considered smooth though, which can certainly be boring sometimes.
I think smooth is a good quality.  The opposite of smooth is harsh. That's what I expect from young spirits or something bitter.  I think people piss on ""smooth"" because so many new drinkers use it when they mean ""simple and easy"". 
Yeah I hear you. There's nothing wrong with smooth, I just said it can be boring ""sometimes."" it depends on my mood. Usually the bigger, bolder, brighter flavors are what really get me excited. Sometimes the MWND just hit the spot, and other times it was too, I dunno, maybe ""uneventful"" is the word? Maybe that's a better description than ""boring."""
"Review #25, Speyburn 10",,https://i.redd.it/5feqfpau87ez.jpg,"I'm doing something different for this review. I enjoy live music, and when I go I also enjoy smuggling in a hip flask because A)I enjoy Whisky, and B)I don't enjoy paying $10 per fucking beer. I've always used a standard 12 oz metal hip flask tucked into my sock, and it works great. But unfortunately I recently lost it in the metal detectors at an Iron Maiden show, which made me decide to replace it with a plastic one, seen [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C1SSN2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I wanted to fill it with a cheapo that I had on hand to make sure it didn't add any nasty plastic taste, so I grabbed this Speyburn 10. I filled a 1oz glass sample bottle as a control, then emptied the rest of the bottle into the flask, let it sit two months, then did this review as a side-by-side.

*****

**Speyburn 10, 43%, $25**

**Nose:** Hits all the classic malty Scotch notes: Caramel maltiness, honey, orange zest. There's some funky and slightly bitter wood notes that are a little off-putting but nothing horrible. The flask sample has no discernible difference. It actually is a little bolder oddly enough, with the wood funk being a little more prominent.

**Taste:** Smooth caramel, malty and fruity, mild citrus, lightly sweet. Some toffee richness that keeps it from being too light-bodied. Pretty straight forward Scotch goodness. Again the flask sample has no signs of any ill effects, on the contrary the flavor is slightly bolder and richer(!?).

**Finish:** Sweet caramel, that mildly rich toffee, malt. The sweet malt actually lingers for a much nicer and longer finish than I would have expected.

*****

I'm always surprised by just how good this Whisky is for the price, it always manages to catch me off guard. It seems like there's so many Scotches that can't deliver what the nose promises, but this one actually tastes better than it smells. No ethanol or ""young"" astringency, just straight forward Scotch goodness. And it does pretty good at 43%, doesn't taste overly watered down or boring.

The flask performed excellent, with no plastic flavor that I could detect. In fact the flask sample performed a little better somehow, being just slightly bolder and fuller flavored. Maybe the air in the flask, which was only 1/4 full, helped it? I dunno. It fits well in my sock too against my leg, so I think I can safely recommend it at this point.

Score:

Actually one of my favorites. For the price point it's a great daily. I've had much nicer whiskey as well. Those are treats. 
Can you smuggle something cask strength into a Slayer concert for your next review and let us know how the plastic flask holds up to the higher abv?
Great review. This is definitely my favorite scotch under $30, and quite possibly my favorite under $50. It tastes like Glenlivet 12, but costs a lot less. 
Nice to see this reviewed. This is the worst single malt I've tried so far. 
You know I've seen Slayer a few times now but wasn't too impressed last time, felt like they were phoning it in. But then it was in Bakersfield, I'm not usually very excited to be there either. I enjoyed Testament, the opening band a lot more, they were having fun and it showed.  

I actually was wondering after I did this if a cask strength would fare any worse, but I usually just bring a good cheapish Bourbon. Old Grandad 114 would fit the bill I suppose...
Sounds like I liked it more than you, although I guess your statement isn't necessarily bad. Have you tried Auchentoshan American Oak? I do believe that's the worst single malt I've ever had.
I've never seen Slayer.  O.G.D. 114 sounds like a good test for the plastic flask.  Alcohol seems to last in those 375ml plastic bottles, but it's usually lower proof stuff relatively speaking.
Haven't had that one.  I really wouldn't but the Speyburn even at the price. It had a weird taste profile to me, somewhat off or flawed. Thought JW Black was better.  "
"Review #21, OFBB 2015",,https://i.redd.it/bzppfycrzzdz.jpg,"Sample courtesy of u/jride57, thank you very much for the sample!

*****

**Old Forester Birthday Bourbon 2015, 50%**

**Nose:** BIG maple and toffee sweetness with a nice warm maltiness. Coffee with flavored creamer, cherry, also a crisp mintiness.

**Taste:** Darker than the sweet nose. Dark cherry cough syrup, tobacco, charred oak and root beer. Nutty kind of creaminess. It's darkly sweet and light, never feels too huge or heavy though which is nice sometimes.

**Finish:** Sweet char and dark cherry, with some friendly baking spice popping up.

*****

I know there's a lot of hype around this stuff, but I had no idea what to expect as far as flavor profile. It's kind of a fun journey. It has a deliciously sweet and complex nose that then moves into darker territory with the flavor, but while still managing to stay kind of crisp and fresh, and sweet throughout. It has a big, warm, ""roundness"" to it that I usually associate with malts and sometimes wheaters. Just lovely stuff really and VERY drinkable. It never ceases to amaze me what a huge variety of different experiences Bourbon can offer. Unsurprisingly though, it doesn't seem to be worth the $300 it goes for at my shitty little local shop. Yet another tasty Bourbon that I can lament never (probably) being able to get, but I'm still thrilled to have tried it!

"Review #20, Willett Rye 3yr",,https://i.redd.it/h4v79yfkitcz.jpg,"Sample courtesy of u/jride57

*****

**Willett 3yr Rye, 54.5%**

**Color:** [1.4](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg), excellent rich color

**Nose:** Big rich caramel and toffee, crisp minty Rye, candy cherry sweetness, smooth and gritty wood. No hint of dill or anything bitter, just big and warm with that minty Rye twang.

**Taste:** Bright and clear, and totally a Rye. Menthol and rich toffee. A fruity, candy sweetness. Again no trace of dill like the MGP Willett I had, just warm and pleasant with nothing off-putting at all. A tad thin on the mouthfeel though, but it's forgivable with such delicious flavor. Drinks wonderfully at full proof.

**Finish:** Short, but very sweet with warm caramel and mouth numbing menthol

*****

I'm a big fan of the 7yr MGP-distilled juice, which is probably the best Rye I have ever had. But I had written off younger Willett-made Rye after trying another 3yr that wasn't awful, but just didn't do much for me. I don't know if it was my mood, or barrel variation, or my tastes changing, but this pour is a whole other story. Everything about this is just delicious: Warm, fruity, sweet and pleasant with minty Rye tying it all together. The overall mouthfeel and finish were lacking a little, but being bottled at Barrel Proof helped immensely by delivering all the big yummy flavor. Luckily this stuff isn't too expensive or hard to find where I'm at, but I'm a little concerned about barrel variation after not caring for the other sample I tried. I have a feeling though that for $45-$50 I might take the chance.

I very much agree with everything here. I was a little concerned that I paid $40 for a 3 year Rye but I fall in love with the juice, not the age. This especially rings true when there is so much MGP Rye out there and I'm not a huge fan of that profile. 

Can't wait to try their 4 year!

Octomore 6's,,https://i.redd.it/1ef97hmiy7cz.jpg,"Set out to do a side by side review on the 6.1 and 6.3, but it just didn't work out so I put down the paper and just enjoyed them. I will say I slightly preferred the 6.3. It had a little more Laddie funk and very big, interesting, unique flavors. The 6.1 is sharper and cleaner, lots of briny Islay goodness. Both a solid 8/10.
Having tried both of these, I can confidently say that I prefer the 06.2.
I've heard some people crap on the 6.1 but honestly it's by far the best scotch I've ever had
Funny how subjectivity works huh. I gave away 9/10ths of my 6.2 to someone who would like it, as it was the worst Octomore ever released imo.
Actually, the only reason I have a bottle of 6.1 is because in another tasting I preferred it over the 6.3. So apparently I go back and forth between which one is my favorite, they're both amazing though.
6.1 is amazing. "

**Nose:** Standard Laphroaig medicinal peat, this one has extra band-aid though. Sharp minty sweetness and lots of dark ashy char, with smooth vanilla rounding it out nicely.

**Taste:** Beautiful vanilla and caramel richness intertwined with some dark fruity sweetness and musty, swampy peat that doesn't dominate. It just tastes ""dark"" and elegant and mysterious.

**Finish:** Rich vanilla, charred peat, dark sweetness. Leaves behind a kind of dark, chocolatey toasted char. A really nice finish.

*****

This is delicious, and has a really interesting profile of dark, charred sweetness that is very well integrated with the standard Laphroaig smokiness. I admit with the price ($100+), and it being NAS, I wasn't real excited about this one, but I ended up really liking it. That being said the price is way too much. I feel like this should be in the $60-$80 range, and even at $80 that would be a hard sell. But then again I certainly enjoyed this more than the 2016 Cairdeas or PX.

Great review, and as far as I remember when I tasted this last year (in September, ended up buying a bottle from the same box as the pour bottle - was on sale for $110), your tasting notes are spot on. I still haven't opened the bottle I bought, because I'm saving it for my daughter's wedding. I have heard from other reviewers that they didn't like the Lore at all, so I'm guessing that there were different batches, some better than others. Anybody have the same experience?
Great pour, somehow $70 in MA so i can enjoy it guilt free!
I tasted this a few months back, and your review makes me wonder if different people might perceive phenols very differently. From your notes, it sounds like a lovely dram. When I tasted it, all I could perceive was smoke; smoke and ash. I thought it might be what the runoff firehouse water from a building that was burnt down twice might taste like. 

I love Quarter Cask, and Bunnahabhain, or even Caol Ila - all have that peat, with some other complexity. But this one was just peat to me. I'll have to find this again and try to taste it differently somehow! Great review:) 
""The DARKEST Laphroaig ever.""
I have really enjoyed this bottle so far! I do agree it is a little overpriced. This will probably be my last bottle of Lore (it's also the first), but I don't regret buying it. 
Could be, but I think a lot of the negativity is just backlash from Laphroaig releasing an overpriced NAS Whisky. I think if this was being sold for $60-$80 it would have gotten more praise.
Given how complex the purported recipe is, I can only imagine that the batch variance would be high.
Really? $70 for Lore? Where in MA is this being sold for this price, may I ask? Thanks.
It was very smoky and ashy, I think what you picked up as ash is what I described as a toasted or charred flavor. And different people absolutely taste the same things differently. Things can even taste different day to day depending on my mood, or as a bottle oxidizes. That's why I prefer to do a review over a couple sittings, but with these 2oz samples that's not always easy.
And now they have their four oak and 1815 editions. I probably won't get around to these. So much scotch, so little time......

But I am looking forward to opening my overpriced Lore later this year. Sometimes you just have to splurge, especially when the liquor store is letting you sample 50 different pours, with snacks, all for free! (Honestly, there were a lot of things I always wanted to try, and found I didn't like after trying them at this vast tasting, so they ended up saving me a bundle in trial bottles that I would have ended up suffering through to finish)

That sounds like a hoot, glad to hear you were able to get this as an informed drinker. I guess ""overpriced"" really is relative, if you enjoy it that's all that matters. It really is good stuff, and kind of a unique profile for Laphroaig. Enjoy your bottle!
Thank you. I'll head down there next week, but will call first to be sure they have some.
I resisted buying the Lore for a long time. Then the local liquor store had this scotch tasting, with no fewer than 15 stations, 4 or 5 at each station. I had an advance listing, so had already marked off things I wanted to try. Some were very expensive bottles, around $300-400 each. I didn't find any in that range that tasted as good as some of the stuff I'm generally getting in the US$55-80 range, so was at least spared from having to really splurge on something I found I didn't like at all. One of the Kavalan's falls into this group, if I recall. Generally I like any Laphroaig, but the triple wood was very disappointing. "
"Review #19, Old Rip Van Winkle",,https://i.redd.it/lfja56yz80az.jpg,"This is my very first taste of a van Winkle Bourbon, and I've been very curious to see what all the fuss is about with these things. Thanks to u/nteagle for the chance to try it.

**Old Rip Van Winkle 10yr, 2014, 53.5%**

**Color:** Bourbon

**Nose:** Sweet, well rounded, friendly and inviting. Warm orange zest, sweet caramel, smooooth brown sugar, musty wood, herbal mintiness.

**Taste:** Sweet caramel and brown sugar with some nice herbal spice. Like the nose, it's just really friendly and pleasant. It's real ""middle of the road,"" has some sweetness, some spice, some wood, some creaminess, but never hits any of these notes in a real big way. But they all combine nicely making this very well rounded, and it's thoroughly enjoyable at 107 proof.

**Finish:** Very sweet finish with cherry, caramel and some herbal mintiness. Shortish but big and pleasant.

*****

I have really enjoyed every WHEATER I've tried so far, and this is no exception. Creamy and sweet with just a little bit of spice kick to remind you you're drinking Bourbon. It's certainly a step up from Weller for me, with bigger flavor and more Bourbon goodness. It's a shame I can't just go to the store and buy a bottle though, due to all the ridiculous hype. I mean this stuff is fucking tasty, but a quick search brings up a bunch of bottles in my area for $600+, which is just comical. This would be a great deal at the $60 MSRP. Hopefully with the boom they're producing enough now that it will be more plentiful in 5-10 years, and I will actually be able to enjoy a bottle.

This is one of those drinks I just don't think I'll have in the next several years unless I get really lucky because I won't buy it for much more than retail. I'm happy to hear that it's a step up from OWA because I think OWA is a hot mess, and this is coming from a barrel proof drinker so it's not the proof that's the problem.

This is starting to approach 400 dollars a bottle on the secondary and I've never heard of a single person who thinks ORVW is anything more than about where you've rated it. Fact is even if I found it for retail I'd probably just trade it in to work my way to something really special like WLW. 
Good review, you've summed it up well. Had it a while back, and found much the same.  Was lucky enough to get a bottle at MSRP in my provincial lottery last year, and was happy to crack open with friends.  It's a nice pour, and surprisingly better than my OWA.

In contrast, I find Lot B virtually identical to Weller 12 (not surprisingly).
Great WHEATER.  Thanks for sharing the review üåæüëç
Glad you got to try it. There is some variation year to year though this is the best of the BT distillate Van Winkle IMO. I thought '13 and ' 14 were close and really on par with your review. Thought BT had the 10/107 really dialed in. But the '15 was a step down from those. Didn't try a '16 yet. Hope '15 was just an off year.  
I'm a fan of Weller 12 and the 107, and yeah like I said this one feels like a step up from those. Much richer than the OWA but at the same proof. Makes me wonder how good a 107 proof Weller 12 would be.

That's great you nabbed a bottle, glad to hear you're enjoying it too.
> this is the best of the BT distillate Van Winkle IMO. 

Wow, high praise considering all the Pappymania. I do love it, and it's great that they bottle it at 107 proof. I've heard good things about the Pappy 15, I have a sample that's also from 2014 that I'm looking forward to. 
Would take this over current LotB 100 times out of 100. And the '14 and '15 PVW 15 had an astringent quality on the nose and palate that got better with airtime but never went away fully. It was off putting and distracting and took it out of the A range and down to B or even B- for me. I'm worried for the BT versions of the 20 which should start as early as this fall. The current 10 seems to be the safest ""value"" of the ones with BT distillate. "
"Review #23, Old Particular Laphroaig 16",,https://i.redd.it/8ughhrrs6u7z.jpg,"Sample courtesy of u/Dyllix

**Laphroaig 16 Old Particular, refill hogsead, 53.2%**

**Nose:** Sharp, metallic and medicinal peat. It's big, bold and briny peat that sure hasn't been tempered with age. A lovely tart sweetness too with some honey malt and rich, barrel-charred vanilla

**Taste:** Not as much of a ""peat punch to the face"" as the nose, it's much creamier and sweeter than anticipated. Drinks great at full proof. Big, creamy peat is there with sweet vanilla and gritty charred oak. Medicinal, almost menthol quality that just numbs my mouth in a pleasant way.

**Finish:** Builds and builds sweeter and brighter with creamy vanilla and clean, medicinal peat. It's a long, beautiful finish. Leaves with some ashy wood char that is pretty strong and almost off-putting, but works really well for me overall with the other flavors here.

*****

Goddamnit Laphroaig, I'm in love again. This is beautiful, no frills Laphroaig goodness, and a little on the sweet side. And not the rich, luxurious kind of sweetness that you get from a sherry barrel, where it seems to overlay everything. But rather a clean, sharp sweetness that integrates itself very well. Maybe it's due to the malt shining through on a refill barrel, but it still retains some delicious toasted wood notes. It's very full with lots of big flavor, but doesn't over saturate the senses-I'm not tasting and smelling peat everywhere I go for an hour after drinking this. It just feels right to me, well rounded while still being quite the peat bomb.

Is this a KL exclusive? If so I almost bought it and then thought better...now I'm second guessing myself.
I agree with you on this review, 100%. You really articulated the flavors well. Mentioned to you in our PMs that I went in with massively high expectations (expected an 8.5 or 9), but I'd rate this almost exactly how you did. I'm on my 2nd bottle of this now and I've enjoyed it more than I did with the first bottle.  

Nice review!
Yep, this is the k&l bottle that came out a few months ago. I'm regretting not buying it after trying it, but at the time $90 was more than I felt like gambling with, and I'd had some meh experiences with k&l IB's. 
Thanks man! This one really hit the spot for me, and honestly I almost scored it higher. I kind of regret not buying one now, but luckily the Arran 20 I went with instead is delicious. 

If I had known you had another bottle I would have tried to swap it from you!
I've had hit and miss experience there too. I prefer to try a same first, but this bottle was one I knew would sell out before that was an option."
"Review #22, Glenlivet 18",,https://i.redd.it/8o7igvdyjn4z.jpg,"Thanks to u/Dyllix for the sample!

*****

**(The) Glenlivet 18, 43%**

**Nose:** Quite dry, sweet and malty. Hit first by very musty, funky fruit(like really musty and funky) and clean malt. Rich orange. There's dark and creamy yet delicate sherry notes like dried fruit and bitter chocolate.

**Taste:** This does very well at 43%, it has pretty big flavor and could easily pass for 46-48% for me. It has a ""delicately rich"" mouthfeel, sharp and clean yet dark and rich at the same time. Creamy, sweet dark fruit and chocolate that is very well integrated with the malt, exactly what I love about lightly sherried Scotches. Light toffee and orange. Very faint brine, which was a surprise for me but nice. 

**Finish:** Brightens up slightly with some sweet and fruity flavor, but basically pretty even steven with smooth toffee and caramel. Very agreeable.

*****

I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this, which is always nice. I'll admit I came into this with some preconceptions revolving around Glenlivet 12 being kind of a ""middling"" Scotch, and I wasn't expecting much from it. But it is delicious and bears all the marks of a well crafted Whisky. I'm finding that even though I'm not huge on sherried Scotch, I'm really enjoying these older, lightly sherried or sherry finished Whiskies.

The only downside for me would be the almost overwhelming funk on the nose. Usually when I'm talking about funk it's in a good way like Bruichladdich or Rare Breed, but this just a little too bitter, musty and strong. Luckily it's sitting on top of an otherwise lovely nose, and mellows(somewhat) with air.

*****

**Bruichladdich Valinch 13, 23yr, Fino sherry cask, 44.9%**

**Nose:** Red wine, sweet woodiness. Sharp and tannic with a heavier, creamier backbone of big fruity malt and rich chocolate. The nose kind of lays it all out quickly, not too deep or complex but nice.

**Taste:** Sharp wine-y sherry cuts through quickly then mellows out thickly sweet. More creamy, fruity malt and dark mellow wood with chocolate and very mild spice. 

**Finish:** Rich spice-y sweetness and chocolate rise above the darker tannic notes, kind of short though.

*****

This was very interesting but hard to nail down. It tasted kind of monotone and simple, with big flavor that never gets as big as it seems like it should, kind of oddly restrained. It's deliciously dark and creamy, and the sharp, tannic red wine sweetness is a nice change from the standard sherry profile, but I didn't like it as much as I had hoped.

Nice review! I agree with you, seems pretty one-trick-pony to me as well. Must have been a fresh cask, because there's a **ton** of barrel influence. I think with some peat, or maybe time in a bourbon barrel, would have done wonders for this base spirit. 

Nonetheless, it's not bad by any means. I'd even call it good! However, it's not a ""reach for another when it's gone"" dram in my opinion (but then again I'm not a Sherry-bomb fan). 
It's interesting what a far cry this is from modern Laddie. It's good, but it's kinda just *there.* The younger stuff they've been putting out in the last 5 years on the other hand have been works of art. Everything from the Laddie to Octomore to Port Charlotte has just been so unique and interesting. Even when they dropped the age statements they made some excellent Whisky. 

I could be overthinking this though, the Valinch is just a single release after all."
"Reviews #17 & 18, Wild Turkey 112.8 vs WT-03RB",,https://i.redd.it/qmhsbcajeb2z.jpg,"A side-by-side of two different Rare Breed batches. The 112.8 proof ran from 2014-2016 and was recently replaced by a new batch. The WT-03RB ran from 2003-2014, and I believe my bottle is from 2007 according to the laser code dating method (laser code is L70123C111, please correct me if I'm wrong). I went through two 112.8 pf samples for this, courtesy of u/ArtGar95 and u/mdonner1175

*****

**Wild Turkey Rare Breed 112.8 proof (56.4%)**

**Color:** [1.4](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg)

**Nose:** Sweet caramel and green apple with funky grain. Lots of musty wood that smells kind of like wet wood, but creamier. It's not a heavy Bourbon, but with a little water there is a nice richer layer of vanilla and toffee. Bitter oak, slightly astringent.

**Taste:** Creamy caramel, vanilla, musty orange. Slightly metallic. The musty notes also take on some earthy peanut flavor. With some water it has a really mellow, creamy mouthfeel for the proof and how much flavor it has.

**Finish:** Sweet caramel, vanilla and orange. Leaves behind a pleasant sweetness with none of the must or funk. Nice medium length.

*****

**Wild Turkey Rare Breed WT-03RB, 2007, 108.2 proof (54.1%)**

**Color:** A shade darker at [1.5](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg)

**Nose:** Darker and richer on the nose. Toffee, chocolate and vanilla up front, with minty clove. More of that delicious musty wood, but it's a little more reserved. Berry sweetness and nutty goodness. The funky, musty notes are simply a feature and not as big of a presence as with the 112.8. The nose just pops, makes the 112.8 smell kind of weak.

**Taste:** The flavor just jumps out at you, much more rich and lively than the 112.8. Sweet and spicy caramel, dirty toffee, funky bitter oak, a metallic kind of orange. Sharp vanilla along with yummy clove that never gets too spicy. It has a gritty, earthy mouthfeel that I really like. It's sweet, hot, rich and spice-y, all in one.

**Finish:** Rich vanilla, caramel and clove, a spicy sweetness that dances on the tongue then slowly coats the mouth. Fruity sweetness and chocolate lingers long after.

*****

I often like to do something like this as a blind tasting, but I didn't think of it until I had already poured them. Honestly I don't think it would have mattered anyway, because the difference between these is pretty apparent. The WT-03RB is richer and fuller, the flavors are just bigger and more dynamic. It somehow feels sharp and light while at the same time covering some delicious richer flavors. 

The 112.8 is softer, creamier, and funkier in character. The musty funk seems to take on a bigger role, which used to put me off with this Whiskey but after diving in for a review I'm kind of digging it. I actually came back to the 112.8 after writing most of this, because I felt I was being a little too harsh on it here. And it is delicious on it's own, it just can't compete with the WT-03RB  for me. Drinking it side-by-side makes it taste watered down, one dimensional and a little thin. Almost like the 112.8 needs two scores: 6 in it's own right, or a 5 when drank alongside WT-03RB

Nice reviews. I agree the O3RB is better but neither really wowed me. By your scale I think I would have them both at least a grade lower. My main gripe is that every since the 99 batch these taste more heavily biased towards the 6 year old component than the 12 year old and I got a general feeling your notes reflect that as well.
Nice review! I agree with the 03RB grade, not too happy with my 112.8 (and I've been very patient). For the money, I'd rather have modern 101 or WTKS over RB 112.8 - RRSiB over all those.
>L70123C111

This is the second date code I've seen if this format. My best guess is 2007 (as you suggested).
Thanks. I almost scored the 112.8 lower, but I always end up being kind of optimistic and generous with my scoring. And it kind of grew on me with this review. I really liked the WT-03TB though, totally different character from the 112.8. 

Maybe one of the advantages of coming into Bourbon late is that I haven't got to try a lot of these older bottlings, so I don't really know what I'm missing out on!
Do you include the 03RB in ""all those"" over which you prefer the RRSiB, or just the other 3 mentioned?
When I first tried Rare Breed (112.8) a while back I didn't really care for it either, would have scored it lower at the time. But I often find myself warming up to Whiskies when I really dive in for a review. It's not a bottle I would buy again, but I enjoy it well enough.
Thanks for the input, unfortunately there was nothing else in the store to help give me an idea. Does the awesome tube help date it at all? Seems like they don't always come with a tube.
> Maybe one of the advantages of coming into Bourbon late is that I haven't got to try a lot of these older bottlings, so I don't really know what I'm missing out on!

or you are smart enough not to pay stupid amounts of money for them on the secondary. 
I was referring to the other three mentioned, though to be completely honest I find most RRSiB a bit better than 03RB. 
112.8 is not bad at all. I'd rate it borderline above average at C+ or so.
The tube helps date it c.2005 or after. The tube was different for batch 01-99 and for early 03RB bottles. I believe early bottlings of rare breed used boxes instead of tubes.

You could check the copyright date on the hang tag and if it's 2007 or earlier that could help date it.

The type if wrapper sealing the bottle also helps date Rare Breed. The wrapper changed from black to clear in 2005.
Or option C: I save my stupid amounts of money for Scotch haha.

There's just so much excellent Whisk(e)y around, I don't worry about it too much. I have enough trouble keeping my spending under control without adding crazy secondary stuff into the mix. If I'm gonna splurge, I'll get an Octomore or a couple FRPS. 
Interesting. It is long gone around me, but I found an 03 recently while traveling and haven't opened it yet. I also generally like most RRSIB at about a standard B level +/-, but would have pegged the older RB as being slightly preferred. I will have to sbs when I pop the RB and see if I agree. Thanks for the reply.
Haha I don't think I ever read those tags on bottle necks, they always seem like fluff. Only kept this one on because it's a neat old bottle. Copyright is 2006 in there, and it had clear wrap. Seems like 2007 is a safe guess, but I'll correct myself if I ever hear otherwise. I wasn't expecting it to be any older, just didn't wanna give it credit for being older than it actually is.
Let's keep in mind that RRSiB are single barrels and will vary. Also, 03RB ran for a long time. Each year could be made of infinite combinations of an unknown number of barrels of unknown ages, etc. Your 2007 could taste different from the 2010, 2011, and 2013 03RB I've had.
Thanks. That's good to know. I may update the WT Date Code guide for this type of code.
All excellent points. Although note that my 03RB is actually a 2003, so maybe we both should sbs mine when I open it. :)
As long as we're talking about this, I also have a couple 375ml bottles that I take to be 2006, but it follows your 2007-2013 format. The laser code is L6347FH1120. Seems like you're interested in the info, just thought I'd mention it.
Thank you. I'm always interested in refining the date code guide. 

I think you are right that these are 2006. It looks like they changed date code format in late 2006, but that makes it even more puzzling that there are weird codes from 2007."

So how bad is it, not getting monthly security updates? Should s4 owners be worried about this, or s5 owners when it happens to them?
Thanks for the suggestion. It looks like it's closer to the size of a note, which is bigger than I wanted. I like the smaller size of the galaxy.
What about the Moto G4 Play?
That does look interesting for a beginner. But checking out the specs it looks like the s5 is a better phone, I'm just not sure about the issues I asked about in this post. 
I'm not sure about the updates, but the software on the S5 is bad anyway.
What do you mean exactly? I was looking at the memory, RAM, processor, camera, and the s5 just seems better all around then the moto g4 play. I'm sure however bad the software is on the s5 it's an improvement over my slider I've had the last 5 years anyway!
They skin Android so it's a shitty UI with a bunch of gimmicks. And then they put salt in the wound by locking it down so you can't change it.

Software differences are a lot more noticeable than differences in things like the processor. Not to mention Samsung's shitty skin generally requires more processing power compared to vanilla Android.

There is also the Moto G4 which is a bit higher in specs compared to the Play model."

**2) OBSF, 62.5%, 10yr 4mo, Joseph D Johnson**

**Nose:** Same sweet cherries hit first, but this one is a bit sweeter than the #1(OESF). Rich caramel wood compliments the sweetness beautifully. That cherry sweetness is the same, but not as much spice or clove and more rich caramel instead of chocolate.

**Taste:** Definitely the sweeter and smoother of these first two. Sharp cherry sweetness peaks quickly then is smoothed out beautifully by minty clove and musty richness. Some tartness to it too. Very fun flavor.

**Finish:** Sweetness builds big and bright again, spice and clove arrive in a beautiful way. Sweet caramel and spicy clove builds and lingers for sooo long.

*****

**3) OBSF, 50.9%, 12yr, Joy Wine**

**Nose:** Musty and refined oak, a dry maple sweetness but much less so than the other two. Kind of earthy, goes along with the musty oak.

**Taste:** Smooth and elegant, a little bit of weak chocolate richness shines through but kind of uneventful.

**Finish:** Shortish, deep and dark notes of coffee and rich chocolate

*****

What really surprised me is that the #1(OESF) and #2(OBSF) had much more in common than the two OBSF's did with each other. They were both a wonderful balance of cherry sweetness and semi-richness, with the OESF being just a little spicier. They arrive big on the palate and explode with flavor as I've come to expect with these private selects.

The #3(OBSF) 12yr was of a completely different character from these two, and kind of boring. I don't know if the extra 2-3 years in the barrel overmellowed it, or if that's just its character. It might drink better on it's own and not with these two more vibrant bottles.

After this side by side I still don't feel any closer to unlocking any secrets or revelations about my favorite recipes. It seems to just vary from bottle to bottle, which I guess is a lot of the fun of it.

**Score:**

1) OESF **7.5**

2) OBSF **8**

3) OBSF **6**

Nice reviews of Four Roses' strangest yeast strain.  The F gives everything a super minty flavor.  I've tried a bunch of OBSFs and they are not all the same.  The best in class OBSFs have big cherry and mint notes and are typically rich.  There's an epic Ledger's bottle and an epic K&L bottle that I have backups of in the bunker.  The E can be a little too weird for me sometimes, but if you try the 2014 SiBLE, you'll see what I think is the best of that profile.  Thanks for the read.  Makes me want to crack into some of my sealed bottles.  
Nice reviews!  I'm going to do something similar soon. Curious to see if the recipes remain inconsistent.  
Again apologies about the mix up. I'm glad you enjoyed it, regardless! I've been digging into scotch more heavily lately but I'll have to go back to this. I'm a bit surprised you find it so spicy (relative to the others) given the lower rye content.
I can't seem to find much consistency in different recipes, but then I haven't tried a lot. But for the most part these FRPS have been some of the best Bourbon I've had. My favorite so far was an OESQ, it was huge, rich and spicy. But then another OESQ was one of my least favorites, so go figure!
i agree with everything you've said here. really enjoyed the 2014 SiB LE but on most days F bottles can taste too much like mint toothpaste. 
Thanks, FRPS are so much fun, and all the ones I've had have been great to amazing. I find them much easier to review though as a side by side.
I sure did enjoy it. I don't think that I found it to be all that spicy. It's just that of those two that were very similar, it was slightly more spicy. That's just how sweet and smooth the #2(OBSF) was!
If you try enough, you'll find some ""best in class"" for each recipe.  That said, I've tried somewhere in the neighborhood of about 50 different store picks and some clear preferences emerged.  I most consistently like OBSK, OESQ, OBSO and OBSF bottles, in that order.  My least favorite recipes are OESV and OESF.  But the person doing the picking matters a lot.
That mint toothpaste might be a good thing for when I want to drink but just brushed my teeth.
I've been on the fence about a F bottle at a store nearby, I do not like minty (mouthwash) taste which a few other quite popular names have it also. The bottle is 8y something so as much as I want to try all the 4R's, I think I will pass this time.
Just generally speaking, I feel like OESF is more prone to take a turn towards minty awful.  But then again, the last 3 years, there were a lot of 11/12+ year OBSFs and the vast majority of them were good (at least of the ones I tried)
Wow! I'm just enjoying the journey for now. You know if there is any kind of constant factor it would be the ABV. So far my favorites have been higher proof, like 60%+. That kinda goes for Bourbon in general, with some of my faves being Stagg jr and ECBP.





there is a lot of variance in four roses single barrels, even in the same recipe. some Fs can be really great as the mint plays out really well with other notes. a lot of stores here keep an open of their private selections, perhaps if yours does too you can taste it first. 
thanks for mentioning so.. I called the store, they do not have an open bottle to try but I talked with someone who selected the barrel and they did not pick much mint but more floral essence. Needless to say that is enough for me to go pick one up, I'm sure I won't be disappointed either way :) cheers.
enjoy, let us know how it is once you open it. 
a definite continue to buy and find the others. This is an obsf 8y-11 54.7 and while there is some background mint if you look for it just nicely complements flavors and freshens to extend the rye kick. Well done on this one."
"Review #3, Hakushu 12",,https://i.redd.it/gb35rglfvcyy.jpg,"Sample courtesy of u/MajorHop

*****

**Suntory Hakushu 12, 43%**

**Nose:** Fruity with lots of caramel and warm grassy malt. Mintiness and cotton candy sweetness. There's some light smoke I think, that shows up as faint, earthy, rubbery funk, works well with the friendlier fruit and sweet.

**Taste:** Very light earthy smoke that blossoms and opens up fruity and sweet. Sweet caramel and fruity warmth, with lots of pear flavor and some light oak. It's kind of thin at 43%, but it's hard to complain because it's just so gosh darn tasty.

**Finish:** Not a huge finish, it keeps going where the taste left off with sweet caramel and the light, earthy smoke throughout. Fruity warmth lingers.

*****

It's a pretty simple and straight forward dram, but well executed. This is only my second Japanese Whisky after Hibiki 12, but just like that one the word *pleasant* comes to mind. They both seem well crafted, with very friendly and inviting characters. I can see the appeal of these Whiskies and why they've gotten so popular. I think I'll pass at $70 a bottle, but it's tempting.

Around $80 (US) here in Japan. Which equates to 4x NFTB. 
Love the boozing monkey in the background!
It is $180 in Australia
There's no way hakushu 12 is $70 now. Is that current in your market ?
That's insane! 
I know of at least two stores that have it for that, doesn't seem as popular as Yamazaki and Hibiki.

http://www.klwines.com/p/i?i=1080132



The last place I was in had it over $90 in NY. Tasty stuff, but a ridiculous price.
A lot of stores appear to be dropping their prices, at least in my area. I too can get Hakushu 12 for $70, and I know someone in the area that apparently found it for $60. Yamazaki and Hibiki prices are still inflated though.
It seems to go up $40 every 3 months as well. It is a great drop, just not worth that.
That's nice to hear. I really like Hakushu 12, especially in the warmer weather, but NY prices at the moment are ridiculous. Where are you located? 
Massachusetts. I don't think Hakushu is selling as well as other Japanese whiskey brands around here."
3 phase 480v motor question,"Lemme say right off the bat that I hope this is ok to post here, I didn't see anything in the rules forbidding this and I see some other questions here. And sorry if it's a little long, I'm trying to include all the info. Also I'm in the USA.

I'm a lowly maintenance tech who is familiar with some basics, and I've wired many a motor in my plant. I have an old (early 80's) motor that is rated for 220/480 - low/high like a modern 3 phase motor, and being in great shape it even has a wiring diagram and clearly marked wires still. What's unusual though is that next to the ""low voltage"" wiring diagram it has a ""YY"" symbol, and next to the ""high voltage"" wiring diagram it has a ""Y"" symbol. 

It's currently wired for 240v and works great, but I want to rewire it for 480v to use it somewhere else. Usually this would be no big deal, I would just rewire it, make sure rotation is the right direction and call it a day. But I guess the ""Y"" and ""YY"" symbols are throwing me off since I've never seen them on a dataplate wiring diagram, and being 30+ years old I just wanna make sure it's ok to use with modern 480v. Not sure if it would be relevant, but it's on a portable unit with a plug.

**tl;dr** What is the ""YY"" and ""Y"" mean on an older 3 phase motor wiring diagram, and is it safe to use on modern 480v?",https://www.reddit.com/r/electricians/comments/6bsoyw/3_phase_480v_motor_question/,"When you have a dual voltage three phase motor it has 6 coils, 2 for each phase. When you hook it up high voltage, the two coils on each phase are hooked up in series. When you hook it up low voltage, the two coils on each phase are in parallel. That's why the YY is by the low voltage connection, it's showing you that the coils will be side by side, or parallel. 
Neat, that's like batteries where running in a series doubles the voltage? 

So the ""Y"" and ""YY"" symbols don't make this anything unusual, it's just illustrating what's normally happening when you wire a motor? It's safe to wire the High voltage to a normal 480v 3 phase setup?
> Neat, that's like batteries where running in a series doubles the voltage?

Yes, it's similar, but instead of the voltages adding together they're dropped equally across the two coils.

>It's safe to wire the High voltage to a normal 480v 3 phase setup?

Yes. On a standard 9 lead motor; L1 to T1, L2 to T2, L3 to T3, T4 to T7, T5 to T8 and T6 to T9
Yes, it's a 9 lead motor and looks pretty straight forward. Thanks for the help!
4/7, 5/8, 6/9...these pairings are so burned into my brain I have to stop and think before I wire one of the handful of low voltage motors in my plant.
Thanks again for the help, rewired the motor this morning for 480v and it works fine. 

I have another question for you. I've never messed with 3 phase 220v. If I were to rewire it back (following the low voltage wiring diagram of course) do I just hook up the 3 legs , then switch motor direction by switching wires the same as 3 phase 480v?
Yes, L1 to T1/T7, L2 to T2/T8, L3 to T3/T9, T4 and T5 and T6 together.  To switch rotation simply swap any two of the incoming lines."

*****

**Laphroaig 18, Berry Bros bottling** Sorry, no other info included on the label!

**Color:** [1.0](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg), healthy natural color

**Nose:** Classic Laphroaig earthy, medicinal peat. This is actually quite buttery and malty too, with a healthy amount of sweet fruity funk and pepper. Very nice nose.

**Taste:** A big flavorful wave of sharp, medicinal peat intertwined with creamy golden malt, pepper and warm sweetness. It has a straight-forward, creamy mouthfeel that is just so right, not overly bright or huge and heavy. Thick, yet easy drinking. I'm guessing that this is at the lower end of 50%.

**Finish:** Funky peat and peppery warmth builds up big then levels out with creamy/grassy malt, at the end it trails off sweet and peaty.

*****

I'm a fan! This is very nice, I would even say I enjoyed this more than the OB Laphroaig 18. Apart from the super-typical medicnal peat notes on the nose this is a much different take on Laphroaig than I'm used to. It's quite creamy and cohesive, and has soft edges yet is still big and flavorful. The peat is strong enough to enjoy but still makes way for some pleasant maltiness. Unique and delicious, which is what can make IB's so much fun.

Thanks, and I'll pry look a little closer at Total Wine too. I wanna say they're usually not cask strength though, especially not the Battlehill. I don't actually know what the ABV is on this though, but it tasted higher. 

And Fwiw I remember flip flopping between scoring this a 7 or an 8, and in retrospect I feel like maybe I should have given it a 7. I really loved it though."

**Color:** [1.7](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg) (!!!) I don't always mention color, but this is sooo fucking dark and sexy

**Nose:** Big dark cherry oak, big spice and menthol, deep rich caramel. My god, this is just rich and massive. With some water the spice and menthol settles down a little and creamier notes of chocolate cherry emerge along with peppery spice.

**Taste:** Big charred oak, thick and peppery, and dark, dark cherry sweetness. Warm cinnamon, rich tobacco and dark chocolate cocoa. I swear even with water I could chew on this, it's so dark and gritty and thick. The water, instead of just thinning it out, brings out the sweetness and gives it a creamy yet gritty mouthfeel.

**Finish:** Darkly sweet menthol cherry peaks big, then the dark cherry sweetness and rich chocolatey burnt wood hunkers down and settles in for a niiiice long finish, deep dark and heavy.

*****

Everything this Bourbon does, it does BIG, this is Bourbon with a capital 'B.' It's unreal how thick and rich and huge this is, it can barely contain itself in the glass. I wanna let every person who's ever told me Woodford Reserve is their favorite Bourbon try a sip of this, and then watch with glee as they either fall in love or run in terror. 

Come to think of it I don't think I've ever had a Bourbon that clocks in at over 60% that I didn't absolutely love. So far that's just been this, Stagg jr, and some Four Roses SB's. Maybe it's just good luck, or the barrel interaction, or the concentrated juice. Whatever it is, I want MORE.

Nice review, agree with pretty much everything. My favorite bourbon so far. 
Just wanted to say I like your 10 point scale. Nothing bothers me mildly more than when a 7 or 8 is ""average"" or ""decent"" on a scale.

Keep up the good work.
And btw, great username but don't think I'm buying it for even a second.
Thanks, I borrowed the scale from /u/t8ke. I had trouble scoring things with the 0-100 scale, which like you said ends up being a 70-100 scale, and this has really helped simplify it for me. 
Glad it's serving you well!!
I think I might have to adopt this scale too - seems significantly more intuitive and useful than the 0-100!
I've been tempted to do the same, but I'm not sure how it fits into the Google Docs data.  

So I just compress 60-100 into D to A+.  That's 11 data points, and nobody will get an A+, so really 10.  Works out similarly.  
Yep, thanks again for letting me steal it! Didn't mean to summon you, I thought if I added an extra slash in front of the u it doesn't page the person.
I think that works too. I just don't think it's that important to be so specific with scoring, even on a 70-100 scale. Scores can vary by such small amounts even in different sittings depending on my mood and taste that day. I have done side by sides before though where two Whiskies are really close, so I busted out decimals like 7 and 7.5 just to differentiate which one I preferred even though they're really close. 
Doesn't bother me one bit! It's cool, in my opinion, to see who adopts it and I'm glad it's seeing lots of good use in the community!"

**Color:** [1.0](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg), very nice hue for a natural color 12yr

**Nose:** Honey and malt, very reminiscent of fresh baked pastries. Green apple, and some heavier fruity notes. Warm, light, pleasant and inviting.

**Taste:** Sweet and fruity malt, with more light pastry. Warm lemon, green apple. Very light and easygoing, but there's also some medium-rich caramel and fruitiness that gives it a little more weight and keeps it from being *too* delicate.

**Finish:** The malty sweetness and caramel carries on for a short-ish length finish, leaves me with a bit of a caramel and white chocolate richness.

*****

This is delightful, especially considering the price. Bless them for releasing it at 43% and with no chill filtration, I have to believe it's made a big difference since it has some ""oomph"" for such a light Scotch. It actually kind of reminds me of what a proper bottling of Glenlivet 12 could be, having a somewhat similar character but with more body. Not huge, or massively complex, or cask strength, but easy drinking and thoroughly enjoyable. This is why I drink Scotch.

This one has been on my to-try list for quite a while. I think maybe it will be my next bottle.
Had it a a few months back with friends. At the first sip I couldn't notice the mellowness of it ( my palate had been Laphroaiged constantly). Enjoyed every dram of it. Worth trying again. 
This is great but the 18 is outstanding. If you see it you should absolutely give it a try. Hopefully there's a decent bar near you so you don't have to buy a $120 bottle... 
Thanks for your review. This has always been a favorite. The guys I drink with don't appreciate the subtleties / complexities I get from it. Not available where I am, or in my Duty Free, so haven't had in a while, but now I'm suddenly thirsty for it again. Thanks!
Thanks for the review!

This definitely used to be colored, but it looks like they updated the labeling.  It was always good stuff, though, either way. 

The problem with Glenlivet isn't filtering or color.  If you like this, I would also recommend Cardhu 12yr, if you want to try a mass-market filtered and colored Diageo product.
Sounds like a nice Scotch.  A shop near me still has an old bottle of the 16 at a pretty good price (probably retail from a few years ago).  I'm tempted to snatch that up.

Thanks for reviewing something I can actually afford by the way.  So many of the ""IB of XXXYYYXXX 25 year"" or whatever around here.  
> The problem with Glenlivet isn't filtering or color.

Haha, I take it you're not a fan. I happen to enjoy Glenlivet 12 and I loved the Nadurra 16, and I always wonder how it could be with NCF and higher ABV. 

I tried Cardhu 12 probably a few years ago and wasn't wowed by it, but my taste has come a long way since then so maybe I should give it another try. Thanks for the suggestion.
I've certainly been guilty of reviewing more expensive bottles too. For me I can't just review any old Whisky, certain ones just speak to me more than others. And those often tend to be higher level Scotches, the flavors just seem to jump out at me more. I'm trying to be more well rounded with my reviews though!
I am not a fan, but the problem is a cheap process, which is why they can sell it so cheap, i.e. the wood.  It's not like they have a great product that is just ruined by filtering--the process is engineered, from start to finish.

Nadurra 16yr (bourbon barrel) is an amazing product, but loooong discontinued.

Cardhu 12yr isn't amazing, but for $40-45, it's got some of the same caramel and nuttiness that I get out of anCnoc 12yr, but of course it's filtered.  I wouldn't pay more than that, though.
Fair enough, you always seem to know your shit too. I'm still gonna wonder though :) 

And I'm gonna keep an eye out for the Cardhu, either at the stores or on r/Scotchswap.
I can't say I have any personal knowledge about Glenlivet, but certainly they don't put a ton of money into a product only to ruin it all later.  That's not how filtering works anyway.  Since oak can be reused in scotch, I don't think it's a secret that cheap scotch will use cheap oak."

**Laphroaig An Cuan Mor, 48%**

**Color:** [1.3](http://malt-review.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colour-bar-Big.jpg)

**Nose:** Bitter oak, dry(dry dry) and musty peat, some sulphury sweet and funky wine. Burnt caramel. This is dry, gnarled, cracked and weathered, but with a creamy and sweet undertone. It's an... interesting nose.

**Taste:** Surprisingly malty and light, big disconnect from the nose. Creamy malt and very slight peat, like a non-islay with mild peat influence a la highland park. The sweet creaminess morphs into burnt or charcoal flavor that comes across as dark, burnt root beer, it's as interesting as it is yummy.

**Finish:** Light, creamy peat that darkens and turns to burnt charcoal and ash. It leaves me with that darkly sweet burnt caramel and root beer.

*****

This was so interesting, I'm not sure what to make of it. As much as I love Laphroaig, they can be kind of a one trick pony. Even when they add a finish like the PX or TW it's still very much Laphroaig. This one's out of left field with sweet, creamy notes that still somehow take on a blackened, ashy and somber tone(in a good way!). And the peat doesn't seem to be the main attraction. I didn't know Laphroaig had it in them, well done. I would assume ""European oak"" to be sherry barrels, but this doesn't take on an average sherried peat profile to me so I wonder if there's wine casks or something else going on. 

All in all, this was good and interesting but it didn't totally click with me, it was just missing a certain something I can't put my finger on.

**Glenlivet 12, 40%**

**Nose:** Grassy malt, nice sweet caramel, pear, a yummy apple twang. I've never noticed in all these years, but I'm picking up some darker vanilla oak notes too. A very mild, pleasant nose.

**Taste:** This has always tasted ""green"" to me, kind of light, malty, and floral, with a healthy dose of sweetness. Fuzzy and grassy malt, this is so malty I love it. Vanilla and sweet caramel. More apple but a little more gentle. Overall it's a more mild, thinner and boring version of the lovely nose.

**Finish:** Sweet caramel and maltiness peaks quickly, not huge or long at all but still pleasant for what it is.

*****

It's thin and way too watered down at 40%, but you know what you're getting into when you drink this. It's wonderfully malty and has enough pleasant flavor for me to enjoy, with nothing offensive or off-putting in the slightest. For $25-$30 it's one that I always have around and still pour when I just wanna enjoy something without getting too involved.

Nice review!  It's daddy's apple juice.
Nice review. How does this compare to Glenfiddich 12?
You know I haven't had Glenfiddich 12 in a long time. I always preferred this, but felt it's just personal preference and they're on about the same level."

*****

**Colonel E.H. Taylor Straight Rye Whiskey, BIB, 50%**

**Nose:** Creamy, buttery Rye spice, a thick nose. Thick, friendly dill and sour apple sweetness, rounded out with nutty oakiness and rich, leathery brown sugar.

**Taste:** Thick, creamy Rye. Rich, delicious brown sugar and sweet cherries with a hint of clove. Very complex and deep flavor. The mouthfeel is so nice on this, creamy and velvety with lots of wonderful flavors.

**Finish:** Peppery Rye, sweet brown sugar and clove build to a short-ish finish that's a little brighter than than the flavor.

*****

This bottle has really expanded my love of Rye Whiskey. I don't think of this as bright and punchy like I usually look for in a Rye, it's more creamy and contemplative, quite complex and interesting. The price tag of $70 is basically ok with me, but right on the verge of being too much.

Swiggit-monkey!
Agree with your assessment.  I think it is reliably (including consistency of bottles) the best thing with the EH Taylor name.  (I've tasted the rye, small batch, and barrel proof.)  And because it is pretty pricy, easier to find than a number of BT things in this price/quality range.
Great review and I agree. Highly recommend Michter's Barrel Strength Rye at the same price point. I flip flop on which of the two is better.
Thanks! Right now my two favorites, even more than this one, are a Willett 7yr and a store pick Whistle Pig SB. Michter's has never even been on my radar, but maybe I'll check that out. I see lots of conflicting opinions about their standard releases, then all the hype over the 10yr, just kind of turned me off.  
Where is a sourced from?  Unlike many, I'm not a fan of MGP.
I tried the michter's 10 year bourbon and was not a fan at all. But I am a huge fan of their barrel strength rye. Definitely give it a try!! 
The barrel strength rye is one of the very few I like and buy semi-regularly.
Barely legal rye - B-F so I'm told. Special batch with a low entry proof.
That sounds up my alley.  
I think you'll love it. It's very rich, much like OF 1920 in a way. Not the same profile, but a similar richness."

*****

**LAGAVULIN 16, 43%**

**Color:** [1.3](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg) Deep, rich gold

**Nose:** Sweet, elegant smoke. The peat doesn't jump out at you, it's interwoven beautifully with rich, earthy sweetness. It's a sulfury, chocolaty sweetness, with wet musty wood. A faint medicinal twang in there too.

**Taste:** Warm, chocolatey peat and rich, musty sweetness. Some more sweet sulfur/ash too. It's all interwoven together beautifully, age will do that. Wonderful grainy yet velvety mouthfeel. Kind of watered down and tame though after the excellent nose, most likely due to that low ABV.

**Finish:** Sweet smoke peaks early and then earthy chocolate rides out nicely, kind of shortish.

*****

**LAGAVULIN 12 Cask Strength 2015, 56.8%, NCF NCA**

**Color:** [0.4](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg) Pale and silvery, much lighter and sexier

**Nose:** This is an Islay peatster for sure! Instead of the mysterious, elegant smoke of the 16 it's more of a dry, mineral peat, and so briny. A crisp, refreshing kind of menthol crispness (is this what phenolic is?). And yummy vanilla sweetness kind of overlaying it all. After some time in the glass I start picking up more rich chocolate.

**Taste:** Crisp, sharp peat and brine. This tastes like Islay. There's a subtle kind of peppery, minty sweetness, and faint chocolate/vanilla, but it all just compliments the sleek, briny peat wonderfully.

**Finish:** Peat, big bright and sweet. It coats the mouth and builds to a delicious sweet vanilla and crisp, briny peat finale. Very nice.

*****

A lot of comparisons have been made between these two versions of Lagavulin, but honestly I don't feel that it's totally fair. These are two very different Whiskies that seem to be directed at two different markets. The 16 is elegant and inviting, the smokiness is interwoven with rich and sweet flavors, it manages to be really good and interesting while still having mass appeal. It does suffer from the low ABV, but that also makes it more palatable to drinkers looking for a ""smooth"" Whisky.

The 12CS on the other hand is a clean, sleek bullet train of cask strength briny peat, the kind of stuff we true connoisseurs(aka insufferable snobs) live for. It's NCF and NCA to really drive the point home that ""hey everybody, this is the GOOD shit!"" And it really is so good, it scratches my Islay itch in a way the 16 just doesn't. But for the price (I get the 16 for half the price of the 12CS) I'd rather keep the 16 around, especially for guests since it's such a recognizable and drinkable Scotch.

Do you know which yearly release was your 12CS?
Your notes really align with how I feel about these two flavor wise. However, I am a little bit of a peat head and the 12CS is an exceptional example of earthy peat that I love. It exists in a slightly different realm from Laph10CS and Ardbeg10. Laph10CS being more medicinal, and Ardbeg being more briny in my opinion. Lag12CS seems like the closest thing to biting into a peat brick in the best possible way. The soil and charcoal-like notes mingle in a way that just does it for me. 
Ron Jeremy?
Nice reviews.  Anytime I see ""elegant"" describing a scotch my brain translates to ""boring"" as you can't taste elegance.
A google search says this one is 2015. I didn't realize they did different releases each year, I edited my post. That's pretty cool though, it truly is cask strength if it changes year to year.
I got lots of brine from the 12CS actually. But Ardbeg is more of a boggy, oceany peat/brine to me while this was a sharper, cleaner brine. Both are fantastic, I'm a big peat head too.
?
No one's gonna accuse you of being elegant!

Seriously though, I just don't get a lot of the detailed flavors and notes that others seem to, so I rely more on adjectives. But I would say ""elegant"" goes along with velvety and smooth. To me it's broader, more sweeping flavors that don't impose themselves. Sometimes that works well, but it could also be considered boring. 
Thanks for the clarification. I do happen to have unopened 2015 that I can't wait to taste. I need to wait a bit tho since I try to limit my number of opened peated bottles at 5-7 at a time. I'm lucky/unlucky enough to detect when peated Scotch has been opened too long and taste got dulled.

Thanks for the review btw :) 
I agree with that note completely. The Laga8 actually has a lot of those clean and crisp notes that you're talking about. Have you tried it? 
Your notes are fine.  I see people write elegant for this one all the time and it feels like they're writing in their biases because they expect 16 years to be ""elegant."" For example I've never seen anyone write the word elegant in a blind review of anything.  Not that it doesn't exist but that it's kinda born of some preconceived notions maybe.
If you like Lag12, the 2015 is fantastic.
I had a sample and remember really liking it but I never took any notes. I still see it around when I'm down in the city, I've thought of grabbing one a few times but never do.
I also got 2016. Any thoughts on this one? :) 
Accidentally posted from my ""follow only whisky subs"" account. I havent had the '16. I've had the '12, '13, '14, and '15. I've noticed some variation from year to year but overall you're not gonna go wrong. "

The idea of a Bourbon barrel aged Scotch that is usually presented as a sherry bomb is very interesting to me, so I was really looking forward to this. Big thanks u/Imaslapyou for the sample.

EDIT: Thanked the wrong swapper!

*****

**SMWS 54.35, Aberlour 17, 55.1%, refill Bourbon hogshead**

**Nose:** Big nose! Super rich caramel and thick, nutty maltiness, I can tell this is my kinda Scotch already. Just enough of a citric zing to keep it interesting. Bold and rich yet dry, musty and fruity, I like this nose.

**Taste:** A little more lively than the nose suggests. Opens with fruity malt that has a tart, jazzy kick. It opens up into rich, creamy caramel and a friendly berry fruitiness. Thick mouthfeel while having a nimble kind of flavor that isn't overbearing, very nice.

**Finish:** Rich caramel with a tasty zing like blueberry syrup that isn't huge or completely mouth-coating, but it rides out and slowly fades nicely, still enjoyable.

*****

This is a beautiful Scotch, very elegant and rich yet retains a lot of fun flavors. It is thick and full flavored while never feeling too heavy or monotone. I tend to like younger whiskies and I feel like this is aged to perfection in the 16-18 range, and hasn't gotten too old or ""smooth"" yet. Maybe these big and dynamic flavors work well for sherry aging so that the wine doesn't overpower the malt, I'll need to do more ""research"" on the matter.

Glad you enjoyed it! I really liked this bottle. Sad that it's now gone!
That sample wasn't from me.  I kind of wish it was, as it sounds yummy and I want some now.  haha
I had thanked the wrong swapper, but now I remember you're the one that joined SMWS and went crazy haha. 

I think at the time of our swap this and the Bowmore 18(which I've yet to drink) were the only ones you had. Now that you've had a few more, would you say this is pretty consistent with their quality? Or is this one of the better ones you've had?
I corrected it. I usually check my records, but I really thought I remembered this one coming from you, oops! Maybe because I got that SMWS Pigs in Plaster from you.

I miss that Bowmore 18 too! That one is one of my favorites.

I've had a total of 7 SMWS bottles, ranging from 9 years to 29 years. Quality and uniqueness has been very consistent and delightful across all of them.

Then again, confirmation bias since I paid for membership, right?

It's not cheap, but I'll be damned if their bottlings aren't unique and delicious.
Yeah, I hear you. It's hard to be totally unbiased and objective with this stuff sometimes. That's why sending samples out like this can be helpful, and if it's any consolation this Whisky was not only delicious, but kind of quirky and unique indeed. I'm really looking forward to that Bowmore."
"Review #13, Glen Garioch 1994",,https://i.redd.it/ze25r7evz6sy.jpg,"This is a 1994 vintage that was bottled at 17 years of age, from what I can tell though it's a batch system and not a single barrel. Thanks to u/tenpiecenugget for the sample.

*****

**Glen Garioch Vintage 1994, 17yr, 53.9%**

**Nose:** Hot, with slightly tart butterscotch. Closed and doesn't reveal much before adding water. After a little water, it's very dry and subdued, yet slightly tart. Creamy maltiness, some sweet chocolatey citrus, and very slight wood. From the nose this has a kind of IB ""this could be any Scotch"" quality. Not bad, but nothing remarkable.

**Taste:** Friendly, Scotchy maltiness with some nice butterscotch and very light vanilla wood. Good, but kind of generic tasting except for this bitter undertone that I can't decide if I like or not.

**Finish:** A little stronger than the initial taste. Slightly woodier and more rich chocolate, but short and anticlimactic. That bitter note carries through and leaves an unpleasant taste in my mouth.

*****

All in all this is a tasty Scotch, and it hits all the right notes, but just doesn't wow me or strike my fancy. And it tastes a little weak and watered down to me despite being Cask Strength, almost like it's muted or holding back. And that bitterness put me off even if it did make it a little more interesting.

*****

**Color:** [1.8](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg)(dark as fuck)

**Nose:** Super fruity, rather closed and hot. Some dill Rye shining through. With some water the sweetness opens up. It's a very dry sweetness, orange and yummy but a little bitter and funky.

**Taste:** Sweet and dry, water opens this up beautifully. Silky smooth candy cherry that coats the mouth as it builds and morphs into friendly, but classic Rye flavor. The flavors work with eachother and against eachother, like sweet and sour or that salty mexican candy. Very nice. I'm pretty sure this is a finished Rye, which kind of narrows down the options.

**Finish:** Smooth, creamy Rye notes take over on the finish, but with that dry sweetness in a supporting role. Not a particularly long or powerful finish, but delicious and balanced. These flavors dance together beautifully, leave you wanting more for sure.

*****

Wow, that was a treat. Very complex and interesting, and just plain delicious. Sweetness that dials itself back and makes way for the Rye. Such flavor. Tastes like it was right around 50%. At the risk of getting very specific and embarrassing myself, I feel like this has got to be a Barrel finished Rendezvous Rye. I don't think it's Port, which is more rich and decadent. The dryness and candy sweetness makes me think Vermouth or Manhattan. I can't think of other flavors they've done, so I'll stick with that.

Reveal:[HW Double Rye finished 2.5yrs in Quady Black Muscat, 51%](/spoiler)

I didn't really care for High West Rye last I tried it, so I'm not too familiar with the difference between RR and DR. Maybe it's time to give them another try. When I drink this, or MWND, I can't help but wonder what the #&@!$ they were thinking with Yippee Ki Yay. How come these are all so limited and sought after, while YKY gets full release. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this. Thanks again ScotchChick.

*****

**Glendronach 12 year Single Cask PX, 2003, Cask #4001, 56.2%** Non chillfiltered and no color added

**Nose:** Deep, rich grape and prune. Smooth chocolate. It's quite woody, with oaky bitterness and baking spices. Lots of tart fruit too. It all melds into a rich, chocolatey, fruity and bitter wave.

**Taste:** Quite acrid, bitter and hot til you add water, much more water than I would normally add. It then becomes a slow and low sherry, thick and rich but not super sweet. I think brooding is the word. Mellow grape, very dry though. Smooooth chocolate. The oaky bitterness is still there but not as intrusive as it was on the nose. More tart, dark fruits.

**Finish:** Kind of a weak medium length finish, but tasty. Smooth, rich, chocolatey wood.

*****

When I first opened this bottle, and even until very recently, I thought I wasn't too keen on it. But maybe the oxidation has been kind to it, or reviewing it has helped me really appreciate it, but I'm coming around. It's not a flavor-explosion 'holy shit this is good' dram like the 20yr I just tried. It's a little more challenging, you have to delve in and unlock it's secrets. Quite rewarding though, even if it took me half the bottle to realize it.

*****

**Glendronach 19yr, Single PX Cask, 1995, 52.9%**

**Nose:** First thing that hits me is orangey malt. Not a citric ""zing"" of orange, but rather a warm, friendly, wholesome kind of orange. Very sweet sherry, it's winey and bright(ish) but at the same time musty and dank. Actually it has a sweet Rum kind of smell, only with lots of leather and spice(or, as Ron Burgundy says, ""rich mahogany and leather-bound books""). It's a very light and friendly spiciness, like nutmeg or apple cider on Thanksgiving.

**Taste:** Just...wow. Thick, gritty, and creamy fruitiness, like I can chew on it. That same wholesome orange I got on the nose, actually it's like a rich chocolate orange. Dank and musty wood, figs. There's none of the spice from the nose though, just thick, creamy fruit, like super ripe strawberries and dark cherries.

**Finish:** It peaks quickly, and as bright as this gets(which isn't very, like a flashlight under the covers), then levels out into this sweet yet musty fruitiness that is super thick and in no hurry to go anywhere.

*****

This is like the opposite of a complex Scotch. It's thick, and beautiful, and it's just poured onto my palate. It envelopes you and embraces you in it's richness. Instead of morphing and competing notes it's like I'm buried in dark, sweet fruit. Yet despite all this it still retains a creaminess, a kind of easygoing drinkability. I was just saying on here yesterday that while I'm not always a huge fan of sherried Scotch, I've found that they only get better with age. Much more than with peated or Bourbon barrel Whiskies. This is another example of that for me.

Any idea of the cask number?
i love glendro px single cask.  
Nice review! You're so right about the nose, big ripe fresh oranges dominate! I definitely got more bitter notes in the finish than you. As my review states this one takes water better than most. I'm glad you liked it! 
Looking at StolenPrayers review, it's cask #3292 and bottled for New Hampshire.
I have a 12yr that's so-so, but this was just so good.
Yeah, that delicious orange was just right there for me. And I actually barely added any water, just a 1/2 tsp in the full 2oz. It was just so good and drinkable on it's own I didn't wanna mess it up. My 12yr 56% on the other hand needed lots of water. 
I have the same bottle. I also find it to be not very complex. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for in big bold dark chocolate covered raisins, dark cherries and maybe even prunes.
i just grabbed a 20 year from your neck fo teh woods for 175.  expensive, no doubt, but totally worth it in my opinion.
I don't PREFER it with a couple spoons of water (maybe down to 35%) but it does change it a fair bit and make it a bit less one dimensional.
HOW'D YOU GET MY BOTTLE!?
I've only ever seen 19/20 yr a few times, and they were more like $225-250, so that's pretty good actually.
Gotcha. I couldn't take that chance with only 2 ounces. I remember you telling me it was good with extra water, but as soon as I sipped it I was like [""well that's just fine.""](https://youtu.be/ubU3i2RfROM?t=13)

Sounds interesting though, you'll just have to send me another so I can see what you're talking about! :P
Live in Massachusetts and JUMPED on it when it dropped to $130!
yah, that's why i picked it up!
I've taken to splitting my swaps into 2 1oz pours so I can do neat and water and then return to it later and give it a second go at the proof I found best. 
You said same bottle... Never mind I'm just an unfunny pedant.

There are single cask Benriachs available (20 year Burgundy finish and peated PX finish) in the same price range if you feel like crossing the border.
$130, hatchi matchi!
Well good job, I'd pry pick it up for that too. 

You know I'm sipping on that 12yr now since I was talking about it, and I'm actually really enjoying it. Taking notes for a review and it's really doing it for me. You wanna try it at all, or you still not doing swaps? I've been thinking I could use some more Mezcal in my life.
I do that quite often too, but sometimes I just wanna dive in and really take my time and explore it, especially if I'm reviewing it. 1 oz just seems to drink up too quickly. Just depends on my mood sometimes too.
I've got the Benriach PX as well.
i just checked the Cali online store where I picked it up.  No more.  :(

i drank through a 12 year bottle last year and i archived a sample.  Thanks tho!

how much more mezcal u need?
How is it? I'm waffling a bit on those.
PM'd
It's very good, but to be honest I have not spent enough time with it. I will say it is as hugely a flavored whisky as I have ever had. Huge peat and huge sherry.

"Reviews #8 & 9, Evan Williams Single Barrel '96 and '07 sbs",,https://i.redd.it/rwovjv4vjlqy.jpg,"It's kind of annoying coming into this hobby with things like EC12 becoming NAS and the EW SiB becoming generally younger.  But it's just the state of the industry so I figure it's best to just accept the current situation, don't pine for the past, and look for what's good that is still coming out.
A little while back I found a shop with some EWSB bottled in '06, and since this has always been one of my go-to Bourbons, grabbing a couple was a no brainer, even if it's not quite ""dusty"" status. I thought it would make for an interesting sbs with the current version too. I did this as a blind tasting to remove bias, but here's the specs on the two bottles, then on to the reviews:

**Evan Williams Single Barrel**, barrel 450, 43.3%

* barreled 6/24/96

* bottled 6/27/06

**Evan Williams Single Barrel**, barrel 355, 43.3%

* barreled 6/21/07

* bottled 2/6/16

*****

**#1**

**Nose:** Light caramel sweetness and maple, light yet prevalent smooth toasted oak, some pleasant orange zest. Some Whiskies are challenging, complex, and intriguing, this is just yummy and welcoming!

**Taste:** On the sweeter side for sure. Sweet, sugary, maple syrup stickiness hits first, but at the same time there's a deeper nuttiness, a kind of brown sugar toffee. There's zero Bourbon spiciness, but rather a crisp yet well integrated anise, almost a friendly pine with toasted oakiness. 

**Finish:** Sweet and flat. It's a sweet and nutty caramel that just kind of trails off to nowhere in particular.

*****

**#2**

**Nose:** Still that caramel and maple sweetness, but a little lighter and more floral. Less oaky, more cereal/maltiness and vanilla

**Taste:** Same basic profile but a little more vibrant, the orange zest has been kicked up a notch and takes over a little more. Slightly brighter mouthfeel. Same toasted oakiness, but with more vanilla and maltiness.

**Finish:** Still sweet and flat, but a little more ""fun"" vanilla and zestiness that rides out longer and leaves a pleasant taste in my mouth, much more satisfying finish.

*****

The first thing that struck me about these is just how similar they are despite the 10 year gap. But once I sat down to analyze them for a review, the differences became pretty apparent. I preferred #2, it was a little more vibrant and ""fun"" tasting. #1 had a slight acridness while #2 was smooth, sweet sailing with just the right amount of zest. Actually it might just be that #1 had a little more wood influence, which I usually prefer but doesn't work for me as much on this Whiskey. 

**Reveal:** [#1-2007, #2-1996](/spoiler)

Well this seems in line with the general sentiment around here that older=better. But what's funny is that I did an informal blind sbs back when I first picked up the 96, and I actually picked the 07 as the winner that time. I remember thinking the 07 was a little more full bodied and flavorful. Whether it's the oxidation effecting them differently, or just differing taste on any given day, I can't really say. Any differences seemed minor anyway, and probably due more to barrel variation than anything else. I still love this Whiskey, and it's still one I recommend to n00bs looking for something a little better than they're used to.

Nice scale and great reviews :) Well done! 
Paging u/mdonner1175
As it's a Single barrel offering,  it could be more the barrel differences than years. 
The 1996 is definitely a dusty. The 1996 is pre-fire DSP KY 31, while the 2007 is DSP KY 1. While they are both HH, they're from different distilleries.
Yeah, best not to dwell on it as there's nothing to be done, and luckily there's still plenty of great Whiskey out there to enjoy.
Thanks! I have a hard time with scoring, and I never really liked the 0-100(which ends up being 70-100). I'm still getting the hang of it, and your scale helped simplify it for me. I find I'm overly generous and want to score everything high. 
I will do the same tonight before I read yours
Yeah, that's what I think. I was just wondering why the same blind tasting a few months ago yielded different results for me. 
I knew it was pre-fire, but I didn't realize that they actually changed distilleries after the fire. I thought it was just aging warehouses that were destroyed. But looking at Wikipedia, I guess they actually moved to Bernheim distillery afterwards?
I had the same problem. Once I adjusted to this 0-10 it made things much clearer and also less agonizing to try and score! Best of luck to ya :) 
Cool beans. I don't wanna influence your results if you're about to get to this one too. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
Yep. They never rebuilt the still in Bardstown. It was more cost effective for them to acquire the Bernheim distillery from UD/Diageo, who didn't give a shit about distilling American whiskey at the time.
Right. The old distillery was burned down and they had to purchase the Bernheim distillery from Diageo. 
I'm thinking about going to a 10 point must system like boxing. 

Seriously, I should use a pass/fail rating as that's ultimately my take away and whether I'd buy it again.
So is the heaven hill distilled Whiskey generally considered better, or just sought after for rarity?
Thanks for the info. They still have two more bottles, so I'll pry grab another just for the helluvit.
It has a slightly different profile. It's desirable for the same reason any dusty bourbon is. I would say that the stuff going into the bottles was generally older back then due to lower demand for bourbon in general."
"Review #10, Ledaig 10",,https://i.redd.it/e7caixdfc0qy.jpg,"Thanks to u/ebvigilante for the sample!

*****

**Ledaig 10 46.3%**

**Color:** Nice (darker side of) pale straw color, which I've grown to love in Scotch.

**Nose:** Mega briny with lots of clean, sharp peat. This smells like an Islay! Polished and metallic, like brass(in a good way!). Sharp sour apple sweetness, almost citric. Very strong and complex nose, very nice.

**Taste:** First impression is ""ok, this doesn't live up to that wonderful nose at all."" Tastes watered down and just flat. But once it opens up a little, you realize it's just a little more subtle and complex than the nose led you to believe. It has a light, creamy mouthfeel and the flavors meld and shift nicely. Sweet, yet tart fruit hits first, some sour oak, then peppery yet strong peat.

**Finish:** Sweet, musty peat, leaves you with a very pleasant kind of creamy peatiness.

*****

This is a real interesting dram that kind of took me through a rollercoaster of emotions. The nose prepares you for an Islay style peat assault, but it ends up being a little more subdued and complex. It's like a peat bomb that's not a peat bomb. I don't know if it's the dram airing out, or just me acclimating to it, but it grew on me more and more as I sipped it. I feel like this would be a fun Whisky to go through a full bottle journey with. And I'm glad it's bottled at 46%, it would probably be too weak any lower. I'd love to try some at Cask Strength though.

Score: Started as a 7 with that nose, then down to a 5 on the first sip, but in the end it was quite good and left me as a **6**.

Fascinating. I'll have to try that myself since I have both on the shelf and neither are great individually. 
Yep, the glasses from the Glenlivet gift pack, never heard them called a thistle glass though. I like something sturdier than a Glencairn when camping.
I'd be interested in hearing someone else's thoughts on it. I tend to bring cheaper, easy drinking bottles camping, and we just happened to have both these on hand. I was very pleasantly surprised by the mix, and some people there who don't drink Whiskey thought it was pretty good too.

"Review #7, Mystery Sample",,https://i.redd.it/8u8njiv961oy.jpg,"Another mystery sample courtesy of u/ScotchChick, I'll just jump right in.

*****

**Color:** yep, it's Whiskey!

**Nose:** Lightly sweet and smooth(very smooth) caramel, it's a Bourbon but also has some mildly spicy Rye notes. The oak is definitely there, but it's ""quiet"" and non-intrusive. Light and floral, overall very delicate nose for a Bourbon

**Taste:** Dry, yet sweet and malty. Quite sweet. Tangy, sweet oak with a little chocolate. Overall kind of thin and flat, but good.

**Finish:** Unsurprisingly, a very sweet finish. Friendly sugary caramel oak, tapers off into chocolatiness that is slightly richer(not much richer though).

*****

Friendly and sweet, but a little thin and lacking is what I get here. Not amazing, but not bad at all and quite drinkable. This is a Whiskey that someone who doesn't drink Whiskey could still enjoy. I'm guessing this is right around 45%, definitely not any higher than 50%. It reminded me of FRSB a little bit, but it's not a high enough proof. My (shot in the dark, uneducated) guess is Elmer T Lee. I've only had it once a while ago, but I remember it being thin and friendly. I'm gonna give this a **6** on the scale below.

Reveal: [1792 Sweet Wheat 45.6%](/spoiler)

Wow, they actually put ""sweet"" in the name, very fitting. And I'm starting to see a theme to the mystery samples haha, the last one was a Rebel Yell 10SB. Whereas that one instantly screamed WHEATER to me, this one actually took me a second to decide it was even a Bourbon and not a Scotch. I did pick up a sweet maltiness in the taste, which might be what I pick up from WHEATERS since I got that in Weller 12 as well. I'll have to do more research to figure it out! :)

Nice review! Wheaters are super confusing to me in blind tastings as wheat tends to sit back and let other qualities shine through.
Yeah, I sent you 2 wheater mysteries since I thought, ""If he likes Weller 12....""

However, the 3rd mystery sample is very different. 
I feel like your tasting notes for this were pretty spot on with mine.  Pleasant, but underwhelming, and too thinly composed to compete with the other, better, and often cheaper wheated bourbons it aims to compete with. 
Thanks! I dunno, the Rebel Yell 10 SB I knew right off the bat was a Wheater. But being Cask Strength might have helped, and I had been drinking Weller 12 before so the similarities kind of jumped out at me. Like I said, I'll have to do more research.
They've been delicious so far, thanks! Funny I picked the two WHEATERS first, they must have been calling my name."

Did you notice whether it got better/worse/different with time/air space in the bottle?
You should taste octomore. It's not as peaty as it sounds. It's delicious, but you can only taste so much peat.
I still love Laphroaig! It's not so much about the amount of peat as the quality of the peat. And there's so much going on with an Octomore, everything is huge and thick with it, including the peat. That price tag can be a killer though, not worth it to some.
r/totallynotrobots
This guy gets it
You know it's hard to say because I wouldn't dip into it a lot so there would be a long time between each glass. It was open for a little over a year. This last glass was still amazing, it hadn't gotten bad or stale so much as leveled out. A lot of the competing and complex flavors I had remembered had sort of melded into this beautiful, peaty, sweet and creamy beast but without the bubbly, dancing wine notes being so prevalent.

I think I remember it really peaking though about 4-6 months after opening it. I only remember the date because it's about the time I started getting into r/Scotchswap and traded a few samples haha. Upside though I took a sample for myself around that time too.
Thanks for the info!  That will probably be my next bottle. 
Is there a particular expression that you recommend that I should try?
I recommend getting an x.2 bottle. The wine finishes are awesome!
7.3 has been my favorite of the readily available expressions, and i know of a few others here who agree. 6.3 and 6.1 were both good too. I haven't had a bad one honestly!

So it was high time I gave them another chance. Big thanks to u/Jewdontknow who, after receiving a bottle of 7yr from me in a swap, sent me a sample so I could see what I'm missing.

*****

**Willett Single Barrel Rye**, 7yr, Barrel No. 644, 59.8%

**Color:** [1.6](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg) Not sure if Rye has to conform to the same standards of not adding color as Bourbon does, but this is sexy dark

**Nose:** Sharp and crisp! Dill, bright orange zest, spicy wood. Loads of rich toffee underlying it all once the initial shock wears off.

**Taste:** Instant zing of flavor, this one's not a subtle creeper at all. Tart dill that comes on even stronger than the nose. Huge, bright Rye spice just explodes in my mouth(giggity). This is so bright, it makes me feel so alive! Sweet cherry and cinnamon, but also warm wood and rich toffee/brown sugar. Very fun and complex, bright sweets dancing around with richer notes, and spicey throughout.

**Finish:** The flavor just keeps building up to this huge explosion of a finish. Long, lingering Rye spice and dill with bright cherry woodiness, that tapers off and leaves you with the richer flavors of brown sugar toffee and vanilla.

*****

This might be my favorite Rye I've ever had, along with a Whistle Pig SB. Everything I look for in a Rye is here; it's rich and spicy, with an almost minty fresh crispness, and lots of very fun and engaging flavor, just delicious. It drinks amazingly good at 59.8% but adding a little water leveled it out nicely, dulling the sharper notes and bringing out the darker, richer flavors. I always thought $90 was kind of high for a Rye, but I've certainly paid that much for Scotches that I enjoyed less than this.

I have the same barrel #

Good to know that's its a good one 

Nice work - makes me want to open this on spring break
Love this and WP too.  
While it won't be like these great MGP barrels, I think the Willett-distilled rye will be very good in its own right once it gets some more age on it. Of course it will probably be pretty hard to come by.
Great review!  Sounds delicious.
it's definitely a good one. Drink it right once you pour it and then drink it again 20 minutes later and you'd swear they're different whiskies. 
It's always cool when you see some unlikely barrel you happen to have get a review. Hope you enjoy it too!
I meant to tag you on this, oops! This is the same bottle you got, I'm interested to hear your thoughts on it whenever you open it. I can't say how it compares to other 7/8yrs since it was my first one, but as you can see I really loved it. I was able to grab one more for myself luckily!
You know it's not even that the younger Willett juice was bad, I just tend to prefer a really strong, spicy, kicker of a Rye. I'm down to give them another try though, it was a Single Barrel after all.
I'm not a fan of dill, so not a fan of MGP ryes.  I really think the Willett distillate will surpass these once they get enough age on them. But, we're all different.
Thanks, and it is!
I was able to do a side by side with a 6, 7, and 8 year rye a while ago and loved the 7 year. It was my favorite of the three. I have an unopened bottle of that 7 year I tried that I'm very much looking forward to opening at some point.
I think it was too young to release at 2 years. The 3 year small batch releases have been better but I think it will really be nice around 5 or 6."
"Review #5, Mystery Sample",,https://i.redd.it/8dl0bh07nfmy.jpg,"Thanks to u/ScotchChick for the sample, who was kind enough to include some in our last swap. Lemme say right off the bat that I consider myself a little more knowledgeable about Scotch than Bourbon, but Mystery samples can be very fun and educational, so I'm down to give this a go.

**Nose:** Funky Caramel, bacon, light creamy oak and sweet fruitiness. I like it so far!

**Taste:** Sweet and Oaky, quite smooth but kind of thin. Right off the bat two things hit me: I like it, and it reminds me of Weller, so I think I'm getting a WHEATER profile on this. But Weller is what we were swapping, so I don't think that's what it is. It's also a little hotter than Weller, I'm guessing 50-55%. It has a pleasant funk, which makes me think of Jim Beam or Wild Turkey but I liked it much more than Bookers(I like most stuff better than Bookers), and this isn't bold enough to be RB or RR.

As I get through the glass it's starting to really remind me of EWSB, quite sweet but thin, with light, inoffensive oak. But I can't think of a higher ABV version and I still think this may be wheated, so I'm not sure. The only WHEATERS I can think of other than Weller are Pappy and Makers Mark. Pretty sure this falls short of Pappy, and I definitely like it more than MM.

**Guess?:** I really don't even have a guess on this one, but I like it and I'm rating it a solid **6** on the scale below. 

**Reveal:** [Rebel Yell 10yr SiB 50%, barrel 44187](/spoiler)

I enjoyed this, it's got a very pleasant, drinkable flavor while still being quite oaky. It's a little thin and missing that ""wow"" factor, but it's a solid bourbon. I didn't realize this was a WHEATER or I might have guessed it, but it's good to know my instinct was right on the mashbill. Something I like about this is that it kind of manages to be unique and occupy a little niche of it's own compared to other Bourbons I've had-smooth and fruity with thin yet pleasant sweet caramel oak. I feel like this is something that people who aren't crazy about Bourbon could enjoy. That's just my (slightly intoxicated) opinion though!

Hey you got the Wheater guess right! Good review. I haven't tried that one yet, but I've heard good things. Coming from the Scotch world as well, I've found exploring Bourbons to be a lot like exploring Speysides. They're all of a flavor set, and it's the little subtle differences that make them interesting.
Yeah, Bourbon does seem to have a little bit narrower profile than Scotch to me, and with Scotch you throw in things like peat, barrel finishes, and a wider range of aging times. That's why I'm digging these Wheated Bourbons lately. Kind of different and refreshing.

Bourbon can really satisfy me more than Scotch sometimes though, I love the bold, spicy nature of it, more of a punch-to-the-face good time vs Scotch's refined, reflective nature. Hard to put in words. They both have their place for me!"
1.75 Litres is just too big...#FirstWorldProblems,,https://i.redd.it/izqgxmbibhly.jpg,"#ICanActuallyFindWeller12Problems
Overrated whiskey overfilled.  My .02.
There's also a 1L size
Well, thanks for your honest opinion I guess! I tried a sample a while back and really loved it, so I was glad to get this bottle. A lot of hyped Bourbons have kind of left me wondering(ETL come to mind), but this one just really clicked with me. 
It's not bad - just not worth the secondary value at all.
Right there with you on that. I'm more of a Scotch drinker anyway so when these hyped up bottles get crazy it's an easy pass for me. But I got a pretty good deal on the bottle I swapped for this, so I don't feel like I overpaid too much."
"The Laddie 10 old and new, Reviews 7,8,9",,https://i.redd.it/60t6fm1wmtky.jpg,"Good guys Bruichladdich have given us a second chance at the discontinued 10 year age stated Laddie with the ""Second Limited Edition"" release. I still had some of the original 10 year left, so I thought it would be fun to compare the two releases. I had a sample of The Classic Laddie too that I received from u/taddraughn, so I threw that into the mix as well. While it is technically a NAS bottle, you can look up the vatting info on the Bruichladdich website and most bottles I've seen are made up of 7-10 year old Whisky. These are all NCF and NCA, and drank as is with no water added.

Full disclosure here, I'm a big Bruichladdich and Laddie fanboy. So if you're looking for an objective and impartial analysis of these bottles, look elsewhere!


*****

**Bruichladdich The Laddie 10 (original)**, 46%

**Nose:** The stronger nose of the two. Smooth, velvety caramel and vanilla, deliciously fruity yet briny and funky. A kind of bubbly apple and pear. There's a faint peat that I don't pick up in the 2nd edition. I want to eat this it smells so good, Hibiki 12 does that to me too.

**Taste:** That delicious earthy, briny funk hits first, then mellows into creamy caramel malt with lots of warm, wholesome vanilla. Again very faint peat, and it all melds quite beautifully. This just tastes like Islay to me, warm and welcoming yet strong, funky and briny.

**Finish:** Starts a little spicy, and smooths out into a warm, rich, caramel maltiness.

*****

**Bruichladdich The Laddie 10, 2nd Limited Edition**, 50%

**Nose:** A little more reserved and elegant. A tart fruitiness. Same briny funk, but it's a little nuttier and earthier. It's a kind of banana funkiness this time around, with bright vanilla and Honeycomb cereal.

**Taste:** This is much more interesting, it's a little brighter and more complex. Musty right off the bat. Earthy caramel and sweet oak, still lots of vanilla but takes on more of a layered, butterscotch quality. Clean and fruity, a kind of wholesome berry or plum sweetness. That briny, peaty funk is a little more subtle and better integrated.

**Finish:** Nice, long earthy caramel and brine, very nice, ends with just a little bit of warm spice like apple cider.

*****

**Bruichladdich The Classic Laddie, Scottish Barley**, 50%

**Nose:** Brown sugar, caramel, an oaky twang. Briny funk is there but a little more subdued than the age stated versions. Overall it really delivers in this department, this is a pleasure to nose.

**Taste:** Briny and sweet, this one is probably the saltiest and the sweetest of the three. Honey caramel, musty funk. This is more astringent and harsh than the others for sure, and the higher ABV seems to add heat instead of complexity

**Finish:** Bright caramel maltiness, but kind of watered down and anti-climactic compared to the others. Ends with that same friendly spice.

*****

**Overall:** The original Laddie 10 has always been a favorite of mine, and I'm glad I had a bottle to compare to the new version. It's the friendlier of the two, it feels warm and fuzzy to me like home or a comforting embrace. It somehow has a strong kind of briny funk character and quite malty while still being velvety soft overall. Just wonderful. Sitting down to actually review it has helped me to really rediscover it, just as the bottle ran out :(  

The new Laddie 10 has done an excellent job at expanding and even improving on the Laddie character while keeping the ""soul"" in tact. It's much more elegant and complex, sharper and crisper. A little brighter, although I don't really think of these as bright. I wrote ""stately and regal"" in my notes, if that tells you anything. That bump up to 50% really helps with the more subtle and complex profile on this one. objectively speaking, this might be the better Whisky of the two, but the velvety malty funk of the original just strikes a chord with me.

The Classic Laddie, rather than being the inferior lesser of the three is more of a ""wild card."" It uses its youth to its advantage, being much brighter, sweeter, and more lively. That being said it can't really compete with the 10 year Laddies to me, but it's still a solid pour.

Score:

Laddie 10 (original) **8.5**

I still have a bottle of the original 10 stashed away for a rainy day.  Good reviews.
Great reviews!  I really dig all three.  But the 2nd edition Ten is my favorite.  After tasting it, I quickly picked up 4 bottles to be the new mainstay in my liquor cabinet.  So good.  Stately and Regal indeed!  Perfect adjectives for this.
I just got to the sample of 2nd Ed. you sent yesterday. I side-by-sided it with the 1st Ed. and could not get over how much sherry/wine cask influence there was in the 2nd Ed. relative to the 1st Ed. When I had them separately I remember enjoying 1st Ed. more, but after the side-by-side I'd say I preferred the 2nd Ed. I'm glad that we're getting 2nd Ed. soon in NH; I'll have to buy a few.
Thanks! I got another one tucked away too, made finishing this one a little easier.
4 bottles, hachi machi! Thanks for the input. The new 10 is outstanding, and like I said I think it is probably the better of the two 10's. It is more complex and is very well crafted overall. But the original 10 just holds a special place in my heart and tastes so right to me.
Glad to hear you enjoyed it so much! The 2nd being the better of the two seems to be the consensus. You can really tell Bruichladdich went all out with the 2nd, they set out to make something special and they succeeded. 

You know I didn't directly note the wine/sherry influence on this, but that would make sense with the extra earthiness/nuttiness and dark fruit I got on it. Might be why I slightly prefer the old 10yr more too since It's a little more malt forward and I'm not as big on sherry/wine. 

In any case it's a beautiful bottle and I hope you nab some. They're even selling it for the same price as the old 10yr($50-$60 around here), which is cool of them."
"Review #4, Balcones Texas Single Malt",,https://i.redd.it/p35jqm24kojy.jpg,"Thanks to u/Imaslapyou for the sample!

*****

**Balcones Texas Single Malt**, 53%

**Color:** [1.6](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg), quite dark actually.

**Nose:** First thing that hits me is cinnamon toast along with strong, yet balanced oak. It's quite malty, but it's a weird kind of dank, maple-y malt. Very fruity and ""fun.""

**Taste:** This drinks great at full proof, I'm hesitant to add water but I add a drop just in case I'm missing anything. Smooth, oaky malt. Still quite sweet and fruity, in a cherry cough syrup kind of way(like the good one, not the bad one!). A very funky, yet interesting flavor pops up, kind of like yummy, burnt root beer.

**Finish:** A nice, spicy finish. Sweet vanilla tempered with that woody root beer funk that really lingers.

This is such an interesting Whisky, and quite tasty too. At first it came across as really woody and Bourbony, to the point that I think I would have figured it for a Bourbon in a blind taste. But with some air (and maybe the slight amount of water I added) the sweet, smooth malt really comes through. This is a Malt Whisky with Bourbon-like wood influence, kind of a unique experience *a la* High West's Campfire and Bourye. I don't know for sure but I'm guessing this is virgin oak. And that Bourbony woodiness goes along with the rugged Texas image they're cultivating; this doesn't taste like they're setting out to make ""American Scotch"" like some other U.S. malts I've had. They're making Texas Single Malt, its own beast.

Score: **7** Kind of hard to score, because the sheer uniqueness counts for a lot and makes this really enjoyable for me. It's darn tasty too though.

"Review #3, Weller 12",,https://i.redd.it/hd39k053iwgy.jpg,"A big thanks to u/nteagle for the sample!

W.L. Weller 12yr, 45%

**Nose:** Cherry, smooth grain/yeast, a soft woodiness. Light vanilla caramel, and it all combines into this wonderful sweet and creamy butterscotch.

**Taste:** So sweet and smooth. quite complex but nothing overwhelms you. It has a dark cherry oakiness, light fruit, malty and nutty. Creamy and buttery on both the flavor and the mouthfeel. More butterscotch. All these flavors just glide along so smoothly and effortlessly, very pleasant.

**Finish:** That butterscotch goodness just keeps gliding along into the finish. Bright, complex and decent length. Nutty, a little bit of light, friendly spice. Sweet, creamy vanilla oak. 

*****

Sometimes the hype around a Whiskey can kind of leave me wondering, but I totally understand this one. Everything about this Bourbon is just beautiful. There's a vanilla creaminess that keeps it from being overly sweet, it's so smooth yet complex, and such flavor. I don't have enough experience with wheated Bourbons to know exactly how much of what I love here is the mashbill, or the age, or just the craftsmanship. I remember not liking Makers Mark much, but I have a Cask Strength sample to try, as well as a few Pappys. I'm looking forward to them even more now.

There is batch variation for sure and some of the recent ones have been a little oaky for many. ""Sooty"" is the descriptor. At $25-30 this was a great value pour. At the $50-$100 level it apparently goes for now.....tough sell for me. Glad you enjoyed. 
I really do love Weller 12! Just one of those smooth, easy drinking bourbons that hits the spot. I'm excited to pop this Lot B and do a side by side.
Glad you liked it. It was the first bottle I bought years ago and I had no idea what good fortune I had (props to the bourbon guy at my local Binny's). I've been searching for something on par ever since. 
I ran out recently and thought that was the end for me, but I have the best wife ever. She managed to sweet-talk a guy at a local store out of a 1.75 L bottle he had set aside for $79. So I am now set for...a while ;) 
My favorite bourbon at the moment. I found a bottle for $27 recently and I'm trying to ration it but I'm doing a poor job of it.   

*Edit* I have the Special Reserve, not the 12 year. 
Yea! So glad to hear you like it. I couldn't agree more. The bottle had been open for a while and seemed to just keep getting better.  
You know I was actually thinking I would pry pay a little more for this. I personally enjoyed it much more than some other Bourbons at the $40-$60 range like Elmer, Bookers, Rock Hill and Smooth Ambler 7/10. But yeah, once any of these go over $60, I'm out.
I've still yet to see this on a shelf for anything less than flipper (three-digit) pricing.  I've had it twice at bars and I like it - I'd happily pay $35-40 if I could find it for that.  But that seems like a pipe dream.

OTOH I do have a $40 OWA 107 SiB that I love, so it's all good.
The 12yr is a fantastic WHEATER.  It's so good it's almost Papppy
Yep, everyone has their own price thresholds and especially in the current market they are much different than a few years ago. And I'm sure people newer to bourbon hate all of the ""good old days"" reminiscing. 
[deleted]
I've actually always been more of a Scotch drinker who just dabbled in Bourbon, but I've been getting more into it this last year(thanks a lot Stagg jr!) so I hear ya.

I really don't stress these hard to find Bourbons too much when there's so much amazing Scotch just sitting around on the shelves.

"My first(and second) Bourbon review, Four Roses OESQ face-off",,https://i.redd.it/j1fa89ex54gy.jpg,"So this started out as a 6 part FRPS review, with these two OESQ's plus 4 samples of 4 different recipes I received in a swap. But I was just feeling it more with this sbs, maybe because having two whiskies to compare with each other inspired me more, or maybe I just plain liked these more. Anyway, I'm fairly active on r/Scotchswap and I have a few reviews on r/Scotch, so I thought I'd try reviewing some Bourbon(which I also love). So here we go! The Hitime pick was on it's last leg and significantly higher proof, so I altered the air-out time and the water accordingly in an attempt to keep it fair.

*****

**OESQ (Hitime)** 8yr 10mo, 61.3%

**Nose:** Definitely the woodier of the two, which is interesting considering it's actually a little younger than the Remedy pick. Fiery, spicy Bourbon corn goodness. Sometimes I feel like I have trouble figuring out what ""floral"" really means, but wow I think this is it. Bitter caramel, pepper, and I know it's more of a Scotch term but I wanna say briny. Dark fruits, and did I say wood already?

**Taste:** This just pops, very lively. Thick and spicy, bitter caramel, strong undercurrent of that floral sweetness, slight menthol.

**Finish:** Long and spicy, that ""pop"" just keeps going. Fiery, spicy-sweet explosion. Feels like a long, drawn-out explosion that my mouth can barely contain, like when a cartoon character swallows a bomb lol. Just a rich, full caramel goodness that keeps on coming.

*****

**OESQ (Remedy)** 9yr 3mo, 54.3%

**Nose:** Metallic, much cleaner then the Hitime pick. The sweetness shines through unhampered by the heavy wood influence. Instead of ""spicy"" corn goodness it's a ""sweet"" corn goodness. I'm getting a little bit of maltiness or cereal. Light brown sugar and vanilla.

**Taste:** A rich sweetness, or again, sweetness shines through better. No surprises here, the taste picks up where the nose left off: floral with sweet caramel. Winey with a little funk. Again slight cereal. The oak and wood is much better balanced with the sweetness than the Hitime.

**Finish:** Nice medium finish that gives you everything you'd expect from the nose and flavor, kind of monotone across the senses in that way. Pleasant, syrupy sweetness that falls a little flat and fades quickly into oaky bitterness.

*****

To me, the Remedy pick is clearly the lesser of the two. The Hitime pick is just richer and fuller, and that spiciness really appeals to me. Honestly though the nose and taste might be a little more well balanced on the Remedy pick, but I just love that oaky, spicy ""punch to the face"" flavor of the Hitime. And besides, if there was any doubt about which one I prefer, the finish clenches it. The finish on the Hitime is just so long and so good, and the finish on the Remedy kind of falls flat in an anticlimactic way. But really these are both delicious. I feel like I may have done the Remedy pick an injustice by drinking it along with the Hitime, which is one of the best Best Bourbons I've ever had.

Hitime OESQ: **8.5**

Remedy OESQ: **7**

Nice review. I would be interested to hear your take on OBSQ, one of my favorites.
[deleted]
Just send me a bottle and I'll get to work on reviewing it! :P

Thanks man, I jotted down some notes from some other recipes I tried, but I don't think any of them were OBSQ. And they didn't turn out as good as this one, that's why I didn't post them.
The Hitime was actually my first FRPS. I did a little research for what was available and thought I'd like a low Rye recipe more, and I basically picked the highest proof ""E"" bottle they had lol.

The cereal I think is what I picked up as malt on the nose, a kind of graininess. I'll try to narrow down what I meant by that the next time I pour it. I'm kind of still trying to get the whole review thing down, and I seem to have more trouble reviewing Bourbon than Scotch. Thanks for the input though, the challenge is kind of what I'm enjoying about this.
[deleted]
Sure thing! I wrote up some basic reviews for the others, but couldn't quite get enough from them like I did with these OESQ's. Certain Whiskies just speak to me more than others at this point."
"Reviews #5 and 6, a couple of Kilchomans",,http://imgur.com/a/BvcUC,"So in a recent swap u/MonsieurZaccone was nice enough to send me a sample of the Kilchoman Machir Bay Cask Strength from the U.S. East Coast tour, wanted to know what I thought of it. Since I've been attempting reviews lately, thought I'd just post my thoughts here. While I was at it I cracked open a Kilchoman Single Cask from u/vertical_bog . Don't know all the specs on these but being Kilchoman we can safely assume that they're young, non chill filtered and no color added.

*****

**Kilchoman Machir Bay Cask Strength**, U.S. east coast tour exclusive, 60.1%

**Nose:** So very earthy! The nose is just huge on this. Prunes and sawdust. Hulking, slumbering peat. Kilchoman peat is always so hard for me to detect, I think it's just so huge yet so well-integrated that it doesn't slap you in the face and say ""hey, the peat's here!"" It's like a monster that's so big you don't even realize you're standing on it.  A wholesome nuttiness, peppery/cinnamon, Orange marmalade.

**Taste:** Sweet orange malt, which was absent from the nose. Slight cinnamon kick. The earthy peat is surprisingly creamy, again it all just melds beautifully.

**Finish:** Sweet peat crescendos, then slowly fades. A little too short, but still really good.

*****

**Kilchoman Single Cask PX finish**, 60.3%

**Nose:** Sweet peat, minty, plum. Rather sharp nose, there's a kind of burnt rubber smell. I think it's the Cinnamon/pepper I usually pick up with Kilchoman, but toned down it kind of takes on a burnt rubber. huh.

**Taste:** Kind of musty and woody. Sweet, sulphury peat. Briny seaweed. Not getting real strong sherry, but then again to me Kilchoman seems to excel at making an unusual, nontraditional kind of Scotch(in a good way!). It doesn't scream ""sherry!"" any more than it screams ""peat!"" to me, it all melds nicely. It hits on all the dark aspects of sherry without feeling like it's an added flavor or finish.

**Finish:** Quite long, musty peat with dank chocolatey sweetness.

*****

**Overall:** Reading my notes it sounds like the PX Single Cask was my favorite, but I actually preferred the Machir Bay CS. It had a very pleasant, warm, and welcoming nature. It's hard to explain. Kilchoman always throws me through a loop, it's just so different. Even when I don't love it, it's a very interesting and well crafted Whisky. It's like a controlled chaos: astringent, brash, huge, complex, deep, rich. These were a pleasure!

I can't even go on a weekend camping trip without stopping for goodies,,http://imgur.com/a/dK03K,"Love that WTRB 03¬¥, just won four of them at an auction. Definitely a great pour. Am I ask how did you pay for it ? 

Cheers! 
Where did you find the Willett? Nice work. 
Yeah, I thought I didn't care for Rare Breed until I tried some of this batch a while back. I love it. They were $35 a piece, probably been that price since the store first got them.
Found the Willett in a Socal store for a good price, and the RB's in a dingy little liquor store, only decent bottles in the place. Love the RB way more than the current recipe, and the tins are just too cool!
Never had the new batches, didn't like the new packaging, I know , what's important is in the bottle. The 03 was my first barrel proof and I loved it. I bought the 4 bottles for ¬£120. The Willett is great too, I have an open bottle of the 8yo, very nice. Enjoy! 

Cheers! 
I saw a bunch of 7/8-yo Willett ryes when I camping was in Minnesota a month or so ago. I was worried someone else here was dumb enough to camp MN in the deep winter. I imagine Socal was a bit more pleasant - hope you had a great time!
We were beach camping at Leo Carrillo beach. It was lots of fun, I love California! Seriously though, it was actually pretty rough; it got kind of chilly one night and I had to put on a coat :P"
"Review #4 - Octomore 10, second limited edition",,http://imgur.com/a/dhmcY,"Big thanks to u/throwboats for the sample! Like a real big thanks!

**Octomore 10, 2nd limited edition**, 57.3%

From Bruichladdich:

>This spirit was distilled in December 2005 using malt peated to a colossal 167ppm.  Filled into Fresh Bourbon and Grenache Blanc casks, it spent the next decade slumbering in P2, the ancient stone warehouse in the village of Port Charlotte, close to the western shore of Loch Indaal.

**Color:** [0.8, deep gold](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg)

**Nose:** Huge, dank, and friendly, like Hagrid. This is one thick, oily, Octomore, you can already tell from the nose. Quite oaky, more oak than other Octos I've had, which makes sense with the older age. Big, warm peatiness. Warm, happy fruit. That funky malt is there, but is almost overpowered by this big, bourbon-like chocolate and caramel.

**Taste:** Taste delivers what the nose promised. So thick and oily. That warm, fuzzy peat greets you right away, big yet friendly, and gives way to sweet caramel richness. Oaky again, but not quite as dominant as the nose would suggest, melds beautifully. So chocolatey, I don't think I've ever tasted so much chocolate in a Scotch! And it works so beautifully with that heavy peat.

**Finish:** Just coats your mouth, and it's not so much an explosion of flavor as it is a ""settling."" All the rich, chocolatey caramel and huge peat just meld and coalesce, like your mouth is the home this Scotch has been looking for, and now it's happy and content.

**Overall:** This is so unlike other Octomores I've had (4.2, 6.1, 6.3, 7.3). Despite each ones unique characteristics they always seem to have this fun, experimental quality to them. This one is all business. Instead of complex and competing flavors this one is a rich, oaky, sludging, chocolatey peat monster. It's fucking beautiful. Octomore has delivered again (as if there was any doubt!). This apparently is partly aged in wine casks, but I'm not getting the same notes as I do from other wine-finished Octos.

Being aged significantly longer, would I call it the Octomore to end all Octomores? No. I don't think the extra age necessarily makes this better or worse than other Octos for me. I'd say this is just another interesting take on this extremely peated malt. They're using age like they might use a wine barrel or special barley on a different release. Amazing stuff from an amazing distillery.

**Score:** 8.6

Great review!  You put it into words better than I could.  That mouthfeel is wonderful.  And all around, just such a great whisky.  Glad I have some left.  :)
Thanks! That means a lot coming from a seasoned reviewer such as yourself! And I'm glad you had some left too :P

Definitely an experience, but I think I liked the 7.3 a little more. I would rate so far 4.2 > 7.3 > 10yr 2nd > 6.1 > 6.3. But it's all nitpicking since each one barely beats out the one before it, and even my least favorite is still fucking amazing.

7.3 is almost neck and neck with this in my opinion as well.  They are very different and both have their own strengths, but are both fantastic.


And I do agree that the 4.2 Comus is better along with the 2.2 Orpheus.  Both of them are pretty mind blowingly good.  :)"
Review#3: Octomore 7.3,,http://imgur.com/a/xO4gf,"Some of the recent Octomore reviews gave me some peat cravings, decided to dive into an Octomore 7.3 sample. I don't review much, but a few have come along that inspire me to try it out. So here goes nothin! Sample courtesy of Bruichladdich fanboy u/throwboats.

**Octomore 7.3** 5years, 63%

From Bruichladdich:

>It was distilled in 2010 from grain harvested on Lorgba field the previous summer, peated to 169ppm and matured here on Islay for all its life in American bourbon barrels and Spanish wine casks of Ribera del Duero.

**COLOR:** [0.9](http://www.whiskymag.com/media/nosing_course/Colour-bar-Big.jpg), these Octomores are always a very healthy color for being such a young age. I'm guessing it's evidence of the premium casks they use, because there is no coloring added.

**NOSE:** First impression is Bruichladdich FUNK(Caps on purpose) + peat. It's real briny, with an earthy grass/hay. It's all very vibrant and in your face, not the deep, oozing, peaty thud I'm used to with Octo. Actually, the more I nose it the more I realize it totally reminds me of Mezcal. I wish I had some more Mezcal samples to compare it to, but it has that tinny, fruity menthol thing going.

**TASTE:** Still a little reminiscent of Mezcal(fruity, metallic), but way too rich, meaty, and peaty for there to be any confusion. Like the nose, it's vibrant and loud, with lots of different flavors going on at once. Earthy peat dancing around with the sweetness, wine funk, and very creamy and buttery throughout. I wouldn't say ""well rounded,"" because you have very different extremes working together, I think ""well integrated"" works better.

**FINISH:** Here's where the classic Octo profile kicks in: thick, creamy, briny peat. It's a very long, very level finish that doesn't throw any surprises at you, it just holds like the afterimage on a screen that's been shut off. Just beautiful.

**OVERALL:** Amazing. This might be my favorite Octomore after 4.2, and this actually kind of reminds me of Comus more than the other ones I've had (6.1 & 6.3). Vibrant and aggressive yet thick and creamy. Maybe it's that wine influence that works so well? Well done Bruichladdich.

**SCORE:** I always have trouble with this part, but I'd say **9.2**. And on the upper end of this scale, that may as well translate to **92** on a 0-100.

Awesome, great review.  Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the new 10 year.  :)
Love the review. Glad you liked it! I thought the 7.3 was very, very delicious as you saw in my review. The 10 just barely edged ahead of it in my opinion.

Enjoy it you octowhore!
Thanks! I won't take such a long time to get that one, promise! I just bought a 6.1 recently, I wish I had got to this sample sooner because I would have bought this one instead. No regrets though, the 6.1 is still amazing.
I feel like we need an Octomore support group. At least, our wallets do.
Yeah, after picking up a couple more bottles of the ten year to tuck away, I most certainly need a break for the sake of my savings account!  haha"
A joyous reunion :D,,http://imgur.com/a/F0pDo,"How does it compare to the original?
You got that from K&L didn't ya? Lucky bastard!

Got the email blast, while I was overseas (asleep) when it was sent, missed my chance to pick it up, but got the the Octomore 10 Heavily Peated.
Awesome.  The new one is so good too!
It's fucking delicious, my first impression is that it's better than the original 10 but I still need to do a proper sbs. I just took out the OG for the photo.      :)
Actually, no. I've been kind of eagerly awaiting these and I finally saw them pop up about a week ago at a place that was slightly cheaper. K&L was gonna be my backup, but they disappeared quick once that email went out! I want that Octo really bad, but it's a little bit too much for me.

Review #1: Lot 40 Rye,,https://imgur.com/a/O9vp9#SQt8Pnn,"Lemme say right off the bat I'm more of a Scotch drinker but I've been getting into Bourbon/Rye more this last year. And I had no intention of doing a review here tonight. I was in the mood for some Rye and realized I didn't have a cheap bottle open, so I went for this Lot 40 that I bought a while back based on a friends recommendation. I found it interesting enough to post up my 1st ever review on r/worldwhisky. Bear with me, I'll do my best!

**Lot number 40 Single Copper Pot Still Canadian Rye Whisky, 43%**

**Nose:** Pickles burst through with a vengeance, I finally understand the dill notes everyone talks about with rye! It then mellows out into a sherry like chocolatey-cherry. Fruity, caramel richness

**Taste:** Dill pickle is still there, a little better integrated than it is on the nose. Caramel, a ""roundness"" like banana. Tame cinnamon. Woody, not in a bitter oak kind of way but rather a musty, forest/camping kind of way.

**Finish:** kind of a short, fruity finish, picks up and leaves you with the friendly woodiness

This is so interesting, and nice. It's very well rounded, so warm and friendly. I really like it, but I'm not sure what to make of it! I keep trying to think what I would guess if it was a blind taste, and I would probably say it's a finished rye like High West does. Is this just a straight Rye, do they add any flavor or do any extra finishing without putting it on the label? It's not the traditional, spicy rye I was looking for when I opened it, but it's a very pleasant surprise. Hell to the fucking yeah.

thanks for posting your first review here! name your favourite world whisky and I'll make that your text flair. 
it's virgin oak, not finished. very different than most cdn whiskies and more interesting than most too. 
Thanks! I don't review a lot, but a few have come along that inspired me enough to give it a try. Just 2 on r/Scotch and now this one.

I guess Hibiki 12 is the best world whisky I've had. Seeing your flair though, I'd love to try me some of that Lot 40 CS!
I was told it's good stuff, it definitely stands out. Amazing what people can do with just distilled fermented plants, oak and time!
man, we all wish there was more of it. it's not released, but they gave out sample bottles to members of whisky media, and the Toronto Whisky Society got some as well. hands down best Canadian whisky I've ever had, no question.
Thanks for letting me know, I was over on r/WhiskyInventory trying to find some!
yeah, no such luck :( though we've been tweeting #releaseLot40CS to try and create a groundswell, and directly lobbying the folks at Corby!"
"Review #2: Balblair 90, 2nd Release (23yr)",,http://imgur.com/a/EVZ17,"I don't really review much. I kind of have trouble nailing down describable notes and flavors, I tend to just know what I like. The only other time I have done a review is a while back when Octomore Comus inspired me enough to give it a try, and now this one has done the same. So I'm gonna go ahead and give it a go. Thanks to u/sven_jolly2651 for the sample!

**Balblair 1990 2nd Release** Natural color, Unchillfiltered, and 46% (yes, yes, and yes!).

Balblair uses a vintage system, so two bottles of a similar age may be different. This was distilled in 1990, aged 21 years in bourbon casks then finished for 2 years in Oloroso sherry butts.


**Color** [1.3](http://malt-review.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colour-bar-Big.jpg)

**Nose** Light chocolate, sawdust, fruity, a calming warmth. Clearly sherried.

**Taste** Immediate impression: wow, this is beautiful. The sherry isn't nearly as overpowering as the nose makes it seem. Mellow, malty, and well-integrated sherry. Honey, raisin, toffee, creamy/oaky malt and vanilla, just so good. Not a dark, heavy sherry at all, it still has all those classic sherry notes without beating you over the head with it. It just tastes so *right*, flowing smooth and gentle yet strong and confident.

**Finish** A refreshing splash of malt mellowing out into musty, dried fruit goodness. Medium long. The ABV works so good here, I think even if it were cask strength this is where I would want to water it down to.

I'm a big fan of The Balblair 02 (10yr), it's what I would call a ""malt bomb."" I'm getting to really like sherried Scotch but I'm not huge on it, so I was a little worried when I heard about this one having more sherry influence than the 10. Turns out my fears were totally unjustified, this is amazing. The flavors meld in a way I usually associate with longer sherry maturation, yet remain light due to it only being a finish. So for someone like me that doesn't necessarily want a sherry bomb, it's the best of both worlds. I'm really loving this distillery, even though I've only tried two of their offerings. I will definitely be trying to track down some of this stuff.

**Score**: I happen to really like u/t8ke 's scoring system, and I hope he doesn't mind me stealing it! On this scale I would give it an **8.8**.

Cool beans, and thanks :D
I figured you were a sherry fiend looking back at our swap! I think it was a lot of sherried Scotch if I remember correctly. I think the Tamdhu and Tobermory were both sherried, then this and a Benriach PX.

Oops, I tried those samples a while ago, I couldn't remember. I do remember liking the Tobermory though.

Backpacking question,"Me and some friends are gonna try camping this weekend at Joshua tree, gonna be my first time there. We were hoping to just do some car camping, but realize sites fill up quick and this may not be an option. Our backup plan is to just do wilderness camping, we all have backpacking experience/equipment. I realize you have to be a mile from a road and 500 feet from the trail. My question is what is a good trail or spot to do this? Preferably a simple trail with an easy walk back to the car for supplies. Is there an amazing spot to camp to take advantage of leaving campsites behind? Also, how's cell reception out there(Verizon and T mobil)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/JoshuaTree/comments/58jswt/backpacking_question/,"I like the Crown Prince Outlook area. From the Geology Tour backcountry board, there are some rock formations about 1.5 miles east with almost no elevation change.
Do not count on cell reception in the park. You can get it in one limited area, but you must be able to see the towers for it to work. Even then it is one bar an only good enough to make an emergency phone call.

I second the Crown Prince area.
I have a few spots I rotate among, but for a first timer to the park, I suggest you go to the Boy Scout Trail and find a nice rock pile out there. The east side of the trail doesn't allow camping as it is a day use area. The west side is where you want to be. It is easier to get back to the car there compared to Crown Prince Lookout or any of the others. The Geology Tour Rd board/Crown Prince Lookout will be very windy at night this time of year so I would suggest waiting until late spring or camping so that you use a rock pile as your windbreaker. It is very nice though and if you can navigate out to the base of the hill, you'll find a few rock piles that are great to camp by, even when windy. Parking is limited and people at the Crown Prince tend to not respect the backcountry like at other boards. Feel free to ask me questions, I've camped out in that area too many times
Cool. And these backcountry boards, you have to park and register at these? Which means you have to start your hike from these?

Yeah, I kind of figured as much with the cell phones. And thanks for the suggestion!
Thanks for all the info! So looking at a map, it looks like that's right at the north entrance to the park (the entrance we're using). They may want to go further in, i dunno. And what do you mean by ""east side"" and west side"" of the trail? It's an east/west trail, so would east side of the trail be the beginning, closer to the road? Am I maybe looking at the wrong trail?
Yup, you just pull up and fill out a little card that's at the board, be sure you have a pen in your car. They have a few of them throughout the park and it's the only place they allow overnight parking outside of the campgrounds.
I think you are looking at the wrong trail. The Boy Scout Trail runs South to North. Start at the Keys West board and head north on the Boy Scout Trail. East of that trail is day use only, no camping allowed. Lots of animals on the east side in the Wonderland of Rocks. West side of the trail has plenty of rock piles in the distance and you'll be.75-1 mile away from the trail.  Enter at the west entrance for this board. About 12 miles from the entrance to the Keys West board.

Now the trail to take from the Geology Tour Rd board to the Crown Prince area is the California trail. It runs 38 miles from east to west. The trail is bisected by the Geology Tour Rd. From that parking area, you can go east 2.5 miles to the huge ass hill out in the distance straight to your left looking east. You need to have good hiking shoes to get to the hill though as it is a cacti infested area. Anything low and expect your Achilles to get attacked by cholla cactus. Follow the California trail to mile marker 12, continue for another 15 minutes and break left. Go cross country to any rock pile you see and enjoy. 

You can use the north entrance to eventually get to Geology Tour Rd but you need to enter from the West entrance if it's your first time. The extra 15 minutes are worth the scenery. You'll pass by most of the main attractions and you'll be glad you did not enter from the north entrance.
cool, thanks for the info
Gotcha, I was looking at the other end of the boyscout trail, by the north entrance. So a mile into that trail and then about a mile off trail(to the west) is good spots? Then your second paragraph is telling me what to do if I end up going with crown prince, yeah?
Yep, that's correct. If you do go to Crown Prince, there are lots of boulder piles to pick from, but it's almost a mile from the California trail. You can climb up the Crown Prince lookout from the north side of the hill and get some amazing views. If you go back through my submissions in this sub, you could see my sunset picture at the base of the lookout and get an idea of what it's like to camp there"

Somebody slap some googly eyes and a mouth on that thing...
What's that tank for? And what is that blade made out of? Looks like copper in the pics.
Possibly, and I think the copper wiping across the glass lining is optimal for less wear.
We make grease/lubricants. It's a glass-lined cooking tank, heated by an outer jacket with hot oil running through it it. And yes, it's just a big chunk of copper with steel hinges bolted to it.
Ahh, so you go with copper so the glass coating doesn't get scratched?
That's the idea, but you can see in the pics there's been some damage to the lining over the years from blades failing. Something about the process in these cooking tanks ware the blades and we need to periodically replace them. The blades in all of our straight mixing tanks have immaculate blue glass lining, and the blades don't ware.
Is the glass treated in some way? I know of glass surface substitution in hot submerged baths, maybe thays whats going on here? 
They make those copper bars with rounded edges, I wonder if that would cause less wear.  Of course that would come with the trade off of less contact patch on the wall of the tank.
The glass lining is blue, it's smooth, and it's completely melded with the tank, that's all I know.
Once new blades are installed. they pretty quickly just wear in to the contours of the tank. Different edges wouldn't really make a difference.
To what temp are you heating it? Any additives in the lubricant? Silicates, alkalines etc? It should not be lumping methinks, or gumming up, because thats what could have caused that. Like using a electric hand whisker made for whipping cream, on semi-hot high viscosity fudge...
It heats up to 300-450 F, depending on the batch, and yeah, there's all kinds of different additives that the cooks have to wear respirators for. That's all grease is, oil with some additives to thicken it up and give it different characteristics. I don't know what all they use though, I'm not a cook just a mechanic!"

"Killed this bottle last night in the best way possible, with a friend. How come the last pour always tastes the best?",,http://imgur.com/a/twQXv,"> How come the last pour always tastes the best?

I dunno. I've certainly thought: ""Gee this is sorta terrible, I'm so glad I'm finally killing this bottle.""

Mostly gift bottles. Oban 14, Hakushu 12, Russel's Reserve 10 & Bruichladdich Laddie Ten
Seeing this reminds me I need to open my bottle of this. What did you think of it overall? I hear for refill Sherry the Sherry influence is really subtle. 
I've noticed more with these awesome cask strength bottles, time and oxygen doesn't seem as unkind to them. My favorite bottles have always been great to the last drop. There's probably a mental aspect too, I'm appreciating it more on those last sips when I know it's gonna be gone forever.
It is a very subtle sherry influence, I didn't detect any of those obvious sherry notes. I think being a refill keeps it from being overly dark and rich. And the 15 year age keeps it young enough to retain that strong Laphroaig peatiness, while old enough to mellow it all together. Nothing attacks you head on, peat or sherry, it all just melds together beautifully. It's an amazing Scotch imo. And air did help this one, Pry cracked it open about 6-8 months ago and it just got better the longer I had it opened.
Thanks for the notes."
Whisky drinker here looking to branch out,"So I've always been big on beer and Whisky, but a friend of mine at one of my shops has convinced me to branch out a little. And being summer, Gin seemed right. So he set me up with a bottle of Beefeater(didn't want to cut into my Whisky budget too much, plus I believe in starting with the basics), some Angostura bitters(what's the deal with that oversized label?) and Tonic Water. I kind of mixed a drink by feel with 1:1 Gin to Tonic Water, some bitters and some lemon juice/wedge. Fucking delicious and refreshing, only problem is that it drinks a little too easy and I'm gettin drunk(wait-that's not a problem!). Is there an actual recipe I should follow, or something to spice this up even more? I remember my buddy talking about cracked rainbow peppercorn, Basil leaves and a bunch of other stuff but he lost me, and the Gin and Tonic recipes I see don't seem to mention bitters. What are some other basic Gin recipes good for a refreshing summer drink? I prefer to ask some fine Redditors in the know like y'all rather than just google it, so I hope I'm not violating any rules or annoying anybody. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Gin/comments/4w1eef/whisky_drinker_here_looking_to_branch_out/,"Try doing a more dilute ratio of gin to tonic, like 3:1 or more if you wanna get drunk a little less fast. And I do find bitters add a nice compliment to many cocktails, so try it without but keep them in if you find you like better that they're there. Classic G&T garnish is lime/citrus, but really - go nuts.

Try out a Salty Dog or Greyhound - gin and grapefruit juice, salt rim optional - too.
Do you like ipa? There are some more botanical gins you mightdig- I'm thinking St. George Terroir or Botanivore
I've never heard of bitters in a gin and tonic.  Certainly the color would be off, at the very least.  The only bitterness needed is a wedge of lime (and the whole point of tonic is that it is already very bitter--if you really want more bitterness, try an artisanal brand of tonic water with more quinine and less sugar).

A gin and tonic is like other tall drinks in that it's just a shot (or two, if they're small) of gin, with a larger amount of soda.  Then you can experiment with garnishes like basil, etc.  But like a rum and coke, highball, or other similar mixed drink, it's not a 1:1 ratio.

Lastly, there are other gin drinks you can try, but I would also check /r/cocktails.  Many drinks with vodka can be also made with gin instead (including a martini).  There's also the summer classic of a negroni, especially if you like bitter.

Enjoy!
Nah. Feeling your way is perfectly fine. Sounds like you made it happen. Glad to have you!
Whenever I get a new bottle of gin, I always taste it as an old fashioned (also on the rocks, but that's a different story).

If you're willing to branch out into gin, also get a bottle of orange bitters - personally I like Fee's orange. It works very well with fore mentioned old fashioned.
Look for a barrel aged gin. Berkshire comes to mind immediately. There's a local one in my town made by a distillery called Lockhouse and it's INCREDIBLE. 
I aim for more 2:1 or even 3:1 depending on the gin. *ALWAYS* lime not lemon, plenty of ice. Angostura is fine but not an everyday g&t ingredient. It's also well worth trying out a few different tonics. Q and Fever tree are the most common 'fancy' tonics. 
Coming from Whisky, I recommend you try **Hop Gin** and **Oak Gin** from **St. Andrews Eden Mill**, if you can get your hands on either of them.
I've never had a G&T with bitters before, but now I wanna try it.
Made another with the 3:1, and it is good with just the lemon. I think the bitters helped dilute the overwhelming Gin flavor on the 1:1. I Might still try bitters though, I like those strong, competing flavors. I don't usually drink this much right after work, but it's fun experimenting!
St George was one of the ones my buddy was recommending, but I was there to buy whiskey and didn't want to put too much money out on an experiment. My first choice was actually Botanist Gin since it's made by Bruichladdich, a Scotch distillery I love. And as far as IPA's I've disliked them for a long time but this last year or so I've found myself enjoying them more and more. 
I picked up a bottle of gin made with APA hops the other day. A small batch collaboration between a local distillery and brewery. It's great.
Thanks. I tried a 3:1 and it was definitely a little friendlier. I've tried martini's before and hated it, that's pry what turned me off from Gin for a long time. Or maybe I just didn't have a good one. Diggin this Gin and Tonic though! But what do you think he got me the bitters for if not this?
Thanks! With people seeking whisky advice I always like to say ""if you're enjoying it, you're doing it right!""
Despite my love of whisky(or maybe because of it) I've never actually had an old fashioned, that's my next experiment I think. But working in a hot production plant all day, I'm really enjoying coming home to these crisp and zesty Gin and Tonics. I love orange though, I'll check that out when I get around to an old fashioned.
I usually prefer limes over lemons with food and stuff, but the store was out of limes. Trying different tonics seems like the next good basic step once I get these g&t's down.
Seems like there's a lot of different stuff out there, very interesting. And they're a little more free to experiment than scotch and bourbon distillers are. Just out of curiosity, do you still mix these or drink them straight?
> But what do you think he got me the bitters for if not this?

Cocktails, including perhaps some gin cocktails.  That doesn't mean it has anything to do with a gin and tonic.  Try an old fashioned.

I don't like martinis either.  But you would also want to try something more like Bombay Sapphire than Beefeater for that.
I like some bitters with gin. Not strictly necessary, but a good substitute if you don't have a lime.

If you can find it, Beehive Gin is excellent with tonic and bitters. It's got more sage and desert flavors than juniper, and blends well with Angostura bitters.
If that's the case, I gin plays extremely well with fruit. A lot of fruit vinegars (called shrubs) go well with gin and soda.

Similarly, 2:1:1:5 parts gin:fruit syrup:acidic fruit juice:soda water is deliciously refreshing, as well. 
Either, there are mixer and garnish recommendations on the site. Garnishes are a pretty big part of Gin, which you won't be used to with Whisky. A slice of cucumber can make a huge difference.
Just got off work and eyeballed another gin and tonic. It was a little strong and I'm finding that the bitters, despite the name, actually mellow it out a bit when it's too strong. Since I'm liking it this way maybe I'll check those out, thanks."

backpacking rules,"I'm trying to get a hold of a ranger or information office at yosemite, but so far no luck. Gonna keep trying, but in the meantime I'm gonna ask some questions here. We're looking to do 2 nights at Lake Ostrander. We've done it before, but this one's a little different because my cousin wants to bring her son(4-5 years old). The kid's no stranger to hiking, and it's an easy(ish) trail at 6 miles one way. Some people do it there and back as a day hike.

1)Is there an age limit for backpacking, and does a child need a wilderness permit?

2)I know there's backpacker camps, but are we allowed to camp at the trailhead for an early start?

3)What are the rules for camping off-trail before we reach the lake/campsites? The trail is cake the first 3 miles then climbs the last 3, could we camp off-trail at the halfway mark? I don't remember if there's designated campsites anywhere.

Thanks

",https://www.reddit.com/r/Yosemite/comments/4ti4c1/backpacking_rules/,"1. There is no age limit and a child needs to be included on your wilderness permit. So if you have 2 adults and 1 child, you need a permit for 3 people.

2. Your permit entitles you to spend one night at one of the backpacker's camps before and after your trip. You can't camp at the trailhead.

3. Find your trailhead on this map: https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/upload/wildernesstrailheads.pdf. You have to camp past the arrow.
Good info, thanks. The halfway mark before the climb is well past the arrow. Are there ever designated camping areas along a trail, where you could potentially build a fire?
Yosemite just started stage 1 fire restrictions: https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/firerestrictions.htm


Check the elevation of your trip, but you probably are above 6,000 ft elevation.



As for camping out there, you can camp anywhere, but the Leave No Trace principles say that you should be camping on durable surfaces. 
I'm not familiar with that particular trail, but usually around lakes and in areas where the trail is near a creek or river, you can poke around off trail and find campsites with fire rings. Sometimes people build fire rings and camp in locations that are not legal, so make sure your campsite is at least 100 ft from water and the trail.
Thanks for that link.  That's the first time I've seen the exact area at Kibbie lake spelled out.  It used to be no fires at ""the kibbie lake basin"" which I always thought was kind vague.  
Just checked and the trailhead is at 7,000 ft, and climbs from there so should be good. Thanks"

Someone decided to turn a 120v drum heater into a 220v drum heater by twisting a prong on the plug. It kind of worked,,http://imgur.com/a/Dx9Kc,"Fun fact: double the voltage with the same impedance means four times the power. 
It's a 125V 20A drum heater, So someone figured ""one prong is [already bent](http://www.marinco.com/en/5366cr), I may as well bend the other prong so it fits in this 220v outlet."" It basically superpowered the heating element, and melted the aluminum block it's housed in. Actually still works
Im sure it worked REALLY fucking well....for a short period of time. 

I remember at my first job working in a kitchen I was prepping some chilis which have to be thrown into a food processor. Well they just got a brand new food processor, but failed to tell me it was 110v instead of 220. So I plugged it into the wall and turned it on. 

I was fucking AMAZED and how well the thing worked. I was like holy shit that thing moves! And then the smoke started coming out of it... and i realized my mistake... 

Only took about 8 seconds to blend up a small tub of chilis though. 
what is this used for? sorry i am less than a shade tree just curious 


Could someone ELI5 why twisting the pin changes the voltage?
What a bunch of pussies. We've got 240V on everything in houses over here (UK)
HOOOOLY SHIT
There I fixed it 
Well...It heated, didn't it?
That got hot.  That is like the Top Fuel Dragster of heaters.  Pre stage, Stage, BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!, Rebuild.
Hmmmm. It don't work that way I set a fireball were that building stood..  goku.  Kammayamaya wave
Saw something similiar once, got called out to a customer site because there grease pump was pumping ""Blue water"". Got out there and found they had this home made drum heater and their temperature control didn't actually work. 55 gal drum of delo ep2 isn't exactly cheap and they dropped us after we refused to replace the drum of product for free.
Sticking a diode in series would have allowed it to work off ""220V"" indefinitely.  Of course it would have presented a rather odd-looking load to the mains with a bit of DC offset...
V^2 / R = hold my beer and let's find out!
Yep... 
2.5KW at 125 Volts, 7.7KW at 220 Volts.  
edit: add math  
125V * 20A = 2.5KW  
125V / 20A = 6.25Ohms  
220V / 6.25Ohms = 35.2A  
220V * 35.2A = 7.744KW

Was going to say ""it worked until it didn't"" but I'm shocked that it still works.
Still works at 220 or still works at 110?
How big was the breaker the 240V outlet was on? Shouldn't of 35A tripped it? I cant imagine 40A breaker on a NEMA 30 plug
The melting aluminum probably kept the temperature close to 600 degrees, preventing further damage. Course, that effect only lasts until all the aluminum has melted. Looks like you had about 30 more minutes tops before things burst into flame
Does aluminum off-gas when it melts? That sounds very unhealthy.
You could have made that work. If you rip off the ground pin then shove one of the pins in the ground. While still a bad idea you would have 120.
I wonder how much longer it would work like that.
surprised it did not catch something on fire or electrocuted someone
This is why, at least in the US 110v and 220v plugs are not compatible unless you fuck with them like the idiot in OPs picture.
Hope they didnt get mad at you, stupid mistake to have a mix and assume everyone knows.

Label makers arent expensive compared to a new machine ;)
I've got it on a table here, but it normally is on the ground where it can roll around. You set a 55 gallon drum on it that needs heatin' up, and the hot plate heats up the drum. Our manufacturing process uses drums of very thick materials that are almost solid at ambient temperature, and they can only be pumped/worked with when they're hot, so we use this to heat it up.
It doesn't. Twisting the pin changes it from a [120V 20A (NEMA 5-20) plug](http://i.imgur.com/6R5xQeb.gif?1) to approximately a  [240V 15A (NEMA 6-15)](http://i.imgur.com/6ZCKDEx.png) plug.
It 220v outlets just have two horizontal blades. 110@20a have one horizontal blade and one vertical, 110@15a just has two vertical blades. Twisting the prong just allows it to be plugged into the wrong outlet.
Australia too.
Doubling the voltage multiples the power by 4. A series diode only cuts that in half, so it would still be at double the normal power.
Much easier in the states due to 2 110v legs out of phase to get 220v.  So to rig 110v from a 220v plug, just use 1 Hot leg and your neutral will be ground.
This is how my harbor freight heat gun works on low. The diode eventually blew up and it was either off/hi/hi 
EDIT: Okay, major clusterfuck, nothing to see here.
Assuming that plate is 16"" x 16"" x 1"" thick (assuming this heater is for a standard 55gal drum) and made entirely of aluminum (it's not, but let's assume it is), that gives a volume of 256 in^2 . This gives a mass of 25lbm, which is equivalent to 11340g.

The heat capacity of aluminum is 0.902 J/g-K. Multiplying by our mass of 11340g we get a heat capacity for this plate of 10229 J/K. 

The melting point of aluminum is approximately 660 C  depending on the alloy (we will assume the plate melted although it is much more likely it softened around 400-500C and that's what we're seeing). Assuming the plate started at room temperature (23 C) the change in temperature is 637 K.

In order to bring the temperature of the plate from room temperature to melting temperature (assuming an even heat distribution), we multiply the change in temperature by the heat capacity of the plate. 637*10229 = 6515837 J = 6.5 MJ. 

Assuming the plate could safely dissipate a maximum of 2.5 kW (as it is rated for this amount) and was outputting 7.74 kW, we will state the excess heat energy 'stored' in the plate as the difference between these, 5.24 kW.

1 watt is 1 J/s, so 1 kW = 1 kJ/S. Since 1 MW = 1000 kW, 1 kW = 0.001 MJ/s. 5.24 kW = 0.00524 MW

Taking all assumptions into account, the plate would have melted after approximately (6.5 MJ) / (0.00524 MJ/s) = 1240 s = 20 min after the power was applied.

However as stated previously, the aluminum would have softened much sooner than this estimate at around 400-500 C so this estimate is probably not entirely accurate. Also this analysis did not take into account the higher degree of radiant or convective heat transfer effects as the plate warmed up (though they would be relatively simple to calculate).

Unit conversion is fun!

edit: Bad math fixed
That's a lot of watts.
Your third step could have just been v^(2)/r you know...
[deleted]
You're not the only one destined for shock. 
I'm no electrician, but I'm assuming the heating element just works off of turning electrical resistance into heat. I'm pretty sure with that it would work until it either caught fire or melted. 
It still works with the correct voltage, I'm not gonna find out how long it works on 220V
If it's melting it's hot enough to make *other things* off gas if it comes into contact with them but it's not overly toxic by it's self, it very quickly forms an oxide barrier layer even when molten.
I don't believe so.
No.

Source: aluminum is a bitch to weld, but it's not *that* much of a bitch to weld.
As long as it's shiny side down.
Til different voltage plugs outside the US are congruent. 
Does it take a long time or something? Why would someone try to shove it in a 220v outlet?
It takes a special kind of idiot to do that sort of thing.  I've seen people chop off ground pins before, but this is just extra special.
Run through that again for me, will you?

Doubling the voltage multiplies the power by four, okay got that.  A series diode cuts what by half?  The power?  The voltage?
Both U and V are used for voltage.
Don't anyone fucking do it, I know what sub you want to link.

Like a whole lotta Reggie
This particular heater is a resistive element heater.  
http://expoengineered.com/Expo_Engineered_Heaters/HDD-55.html  
Rated at 1750 Watts at 120V, 14.6A, so at 240V with the 120V element =  7024W drawing 29A.
When a heating element fails catastrophically from stress it essentially vaporizes the metal and makes a Jacob's Ladder that fucks up anything near it.

I actually once had a heating element on my range fail years ago. It vaporized 2tbsp of cooking oil, 1cm worth of coiled heating element, and a penny-sized section of an alloy frying pan in an enormous fireball. It also charred all my latkes.
The real fun is that lots of heaters will work even after they melt and/or catch fire!

Oh cmon man, do it.......for science.
Wouldn't it boil whatever was in the drum at these temperatures? I think that would be worse.
Til other countries actually have more than one standard voltage.
Nothing that clever, 220V was available, 120V was not. They didn't know enough about different plugs being for different voltages. I kind of stared at the thing in disbelief for a minute, unable to register someone doing something so stupid. I find most people are afraid of messing with electricity
I think the only ground I've ever chopped off was on an extension cord that I was plugging into a wall that didn't have a ground with an electric tool that also didn't have a ground.

I did however find that the ground in my old house was false, and it would cause my guitar amp to send small current into my guitar (passive pickups ground through the bridge, and therefore the strings) and shocking my hand ever so lightly. 
A series diode cuts the power by half. Think of what it does to the AC voltage being supplied to the heater. For half of each cycle it lets through the full voltage, and for the other half of each cycle it lets through nothing. So what you have is 220V that is ""on"" 50% of the time, giving half power.
Fun fact, we also use E, as well.

In calculations you only use the U.

Sucks what happened to the latkes.
I'm not an electrician, just a lowly mechanic, I was wondering how it's an electrocution time bomb? Wouldn't the biggest danger just be the elements overheating and failing?

> I find most people are afraid of messing with electricity

With high voltage, that's a good thing.
How long was it sitting there stinking before ~~they~~ somebody realized it was a few hundred degrees too hot?
I'm kinda surprised that thing doesn't use a 220v plug if it's heating a 55 gallon drum.
> I did however find that the ground in my old house was false

When my wife and I moved, we found a place that looked pretty good except that almost all the sockets were 2-prong. We said that wouldn't work for us and we'd need 3-prong outlets. No problem, the landlord said, and we got it written into the lease.

Come moving day, we get everything in, I plug in my UPS, and it turns on its big red GROUND FAULT light. A few minutes with a plug tester confirmed that while we had 3-prong outlets, we didn't actually have ground.

So I went back to the landlord and explained that ""3-prong outlets"" implied a working ground. He said that the lease hadn't specified so and therefore he wouldn't provide it. I pointed out that while he was right, the lease didn't specify so, California electrical code requires that 3-prong outlets have a working ground, which means the building was no longer suitable for occupation, which meant that we would be leaving and pursuing legal remedy for moving into a house the landlord knew was not livable, to say nothing about the outcome for the electrical contractor who had done the work. He said, hey, no problem, that's fine, he would just change the outlets back to 2-prong. I reminded him that the lease specified 3-prong outlets and that breaking the lease requirements on move-in day would also not go over well. He grudgingly acknowledged that he would fix most of the outlets, but a few that were really impractical would go back to 2-prong, which we accepted.

As near as I can tell the California electrical code technically didn't allow him to do that - once 3-prong, always 3-prong - but it seemed like it would be a bad time to point that out.
I bet that was a shocking discovery
100% correct. Math using RMS volts and RMS amps is a shorthand that only works when things are neatly proportional. The diode doesn't affect the whole waveform proportionally; it eliminates half of the cycle entirely. So thinking of it as just cutting peak-to-peak voltage in half and reapplying ""V^2 /R"" would be wrong. You have to get rid of the RMS shortcut and think about total power as being the average of instantaneous power. And since half of the waveform remains the same as before and half of the waveform becomes zero, that means the average power is simply cut in half.
So, what's the peak-to-peak voltage?
For voltage? 
Hmm. Where would you use E for voltage? I've only seen it used for the electric field, but never for the voltage drop between points.
Nope. In physics both are used. Depends on context.

Also, I am from Europe.
Nope. Both are used depending on context.  
I am aware that V is for the unit Volt, however, it can also denote the quantity, voltage.
The math subreddit. Specifically, they who did it...
watt
By that ticket literally everything is an inductor. True, but not useful. 
Electrical engineer here -- When you power something outside of its ratings like that, you're bound to cause failures in some of the components that build the power supply/output/etc. If just a single electrolytic cap pops, pours out its conductive material and breaches your primary side to the touchable ground side, you could potentially have a powered enclosure, that, in some event that it isn't grounded, you could become the nice ground for that. 
[deleted]
Stove/Oven as well. After moving from the UK, which has a smallish three pin plug for 240V, it kind of tickled me to see these GIANT plugs and cords for 220V in the US
Don't forget 208, 270, and 480!  And there are many more where those came from!  
The worst part is 220 is still considered low voltage. 
I'd say thats a good idea at any voltage. If you don't know what you're doing don't mess with it
I don't know, it was brought to the shop like this
Wow, what a shitty landlord. That's like having an empty fire extinguisher or a fake emergency button. 
For full wave 220V RMS, it's 622V peak to peak. With a diode in series it's 311V peak to peak. Your intuition that a diode halves this is correct. But it also changes the waveform, so the relationship between peak to peak voltage and RMS voltage is no longer the same. And it's the RMS voltage we care about for power/heating.

220V RMS (assuming normal sine wave AC) becomes about 156V RMS when half-wave rectified by a diode, rather than the 110V that might be expected.
And occasionally on the weekends.
Yep. 
E is from way way back when voltage was called ""electro motive force"". 
In the eighties and early nineties, E=IR was the *only* way Ohm's Law was ever presented to me. Held true through high school texts, my dad's reference texts, and Navy training.

Nobody really used ""E"" for anything in their own handwritten chicken scratch work that I ever saw, but it was how you formulaically stated Ohm's Law if you didn't want to lose a point or five to a grumpy teacher's red pen.
In one of my very first circuit analysis classes, the book used E for voltage in Ohm's Law. Before that, I'd seen both E and V used, (basically) interchangeably. Occasionally I will see U. 
I'm not a physicist, what leads to V being used instead of U? My only contact with this stuff was my ham radio license test and a few lab sessions during my CS degree. 
Gigaty... Gigawatts...

They're giant because most things in the US that use 220/240 are fairly high amperage.  
In this situation it's pretty obvious. No one is going to see a big 220 outlet and assume they can put one of their 110 plugs in there if they are different sizes.
The twist plug that you're referring to is typically used when you don't want someone to easily remove the plug. You see them for both 120 and 240 (3 phase as well). Either you're trying to protect the user from harm (as someone else said, most things that use 240 also draw a lot of current) or you're trying to protect the device from loss of power (a number of scientific instruments are picky about sudden power loss). 

There are conventional blade connectors for 220/208V (what the idiot was attempting to make). 
277*
Yeah. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the plug that was attempted here 2 horizontal blades) is for 208V. The reason I say that is the building I'm in at university is a 120/208V system (with some 230V for good measure) and I see these plugs always marked 208V. 
Aren't those from 3 phase supplies? (see wikipedia for how a 200v 3 phase can drive 200v, 100v and 173v loads). Also 208,220 and 230 are pretty equivalent because tolerances are pretty wide.

[Edit: Nope, apparently those are all US 3 phase base voltages, so the number of possible load variations must be even higher!]
500 volts is where I draw the line. Shit can arc pretty far and you need insulated tools past that point.

>it was just rolled into the shop like this

No, it's a prank fire extinguisher! It livens the place up!
> 220V RMS (assuming normal sine wave AC) becomes about 156V RMS when half-wave rectified by a diode, rather than the 110V that might be expected.

... which is \*waaaay\* closer to 110V than 220V, and while your hotplate may be a little ""brisk"" it won't burn out.  Well, unless it's pretty close to the edge on 110V.
I was looking for a good name for my band...
It's actually a weird E (Epsilon?) for EMF now. They had to distinguish because we use every fucking letter for like three different definitions.
I'm I'm the US, have done electrical work for several years, and have gone back to college for a degree in electrical engineering. I've seen V, U, and E. 
EE student here, in my experience U is the potential from infinity (integrating the electric field from a distance infinitely far away), this one is pretty much only used in physics and not in circuit theory, V is the potential diference between two points (integrating the electric field from A to B, which is the same as (U of B) - (U of A) ) 
Tradition, mostly. There is no logical reason as far as I know.
Yep. One chemical analysis  instrument I use has a dedicated 230V 30A supply. The amount of power it draws is scary. 
Are you referencing mains? As in 220 @ 10 Amps? Because that'll fucking kill you a majority of the time.
Dammit, you're right. I hereby accept my inevitable banishment from this sub.
Yep, electromotive force, intensity, resistance, power. Now measured in V,A,omega, and W. Inductance is L and impedance Z otherwise all the equations would look like someone stuttering.
Jesus, is it a laser spectrometer used for checking the content of passing meteors?
I'd bet he doesn't know what he is referencing..

V and Epsilon were used interchangably for us, more often Epsilon because V was something else we'd just gone over like two chapters prior.
Nope. Perkin Elmer AAnalyst 800 atomic absorption spectrometer. One of the sample atomization techniques used an electrically heated graphite tube surrounded by argon. If you'd like, I can post pictures. It's pretty awesome. 
As long as you're not referencing ground you're pretty safe :)
Electrical worker/electrical engineering student, here. I've been zapped by 120, 278, and 480. Obviously, I'm still here, not ghost-posting, so I agree with you. 

Fun fact, DC voltage hurts much worse than the equivalent AC. 
You should!
Yeah, you can feel the 60hz buzzing when grounding AC. 

In Electricians class back in high school, we all took turns with a DC transformer at very low current. It was 20 years ago so I don't remember the exact peak, but I think it was approaching 1000 volts.


I've only been shocked by DC through a faulty spark plug wore though, so it wasn't even really DC. 
[Photos](http://imgur.com/a/MV8hF) as promised. This is the newer (to us) version of the instrument we've had for a while. Since it was installed last May, I've had more time on it than anyone in our department - student or faculty. As a result, I've been responsible for training anyone who needs to use it, including fellow undergrads, as well as grad students and faculty (the last one being particularly unusual as I'm an undergrad). The transverse heated graphite atomizer (THGA) furnace accounts for the vast majority of the 6000 W power requirement. Depending on the element being analyzed and the type of lamp, the lamp current ranges from about 10 mA to about 400 mA. 

The first photo of the spectrometer shows the metal hydride generator which is being used to analyze samples for arsenic. I'm particularly proud of this because I was the first person to get this system working. We had the parts laying around for a while but nobody seemed to interested. when I started my current research project, I was instructed to get that system working. After a while, I got it working fairly well. It still needs some improvement. As of right now, I'm the only one in the department who can operate that system and the only one who knows how it works. That certainly made the initial setup a bit more challenging since I couldn't really ask my professors any questions. 

I'm also taking increasing responsibility for the general maintenance of the spectrometer (such as tube replacement and lubrication of the atomizer movement system). I'm set to give a presentation on the instrument to several students and faculty who are using it for their research projects. If you have any questions, I'd be more than happy to talk about it (good practice for me). 
I'll do that when I get home. 
You put anything in there that the results surprise you?
For a moment, I thought you were saying you have one of these laying around your house...
Not yet. I was pleasantly surprised that the hydride generator was such an enormous improvement. 
I wish I did. I have a bunch of photos on my computer at home. Even as an undergrad chemistry student, I've been given the task of training people (including faculty) and doing routine maintenance and troubleshooting. I have more hours on it than anyone in our department.  "

Yay, this makes me want to buy a bottle again!
hmmm... it wouldn't accept my code from a 2014 bottling.

My bottle, 16/047, had a couple Israeli, Kosher wine casks used for maturation.
That's really cool. Pretty exotic mix. 
Bruichladdich is supporting and siding with Compass Box in the transparency debate, and they're walking a fine line to do it legally. They were apparently planning to make all this info available anyway, before the issue came up. [Here's](http://www.bruichladdich.com/article/the-transparency-debate-simon-coughlin) an article about it from Bruichladdich.
Bruichladdich aren't good friends with the SWA. Actually I believe they aren't even part of the association. Got this info from a tasting with one of their Brand Ambassadors.
Cool, thanks for posting. I wanna see more of these!
I might too, and I definitely wouldn't have before.
Very cool, thanks. I wish I had posted in the main article for everyone to show what's in their bottle, or give us the code. I'm enjoying the look into different batches, it seems like the wine influence is a considerable and consistent part of the Laddie taste. You're 2 bottles consisted of 20% and 20.7% wine casks, u/SirSamsa's 16.4%, and mine 28%. I'm guessing mine is a higher number of wine casks because mine are all hogshead instead of the larger butts your batches have, so the actual volume of sherried whisky is pry similar. And as far as why a similar vintage is listed seperately, mine does that too (two 2006 1st fill bourbon barrel, 4 casks and 11 casks). It's probably listing two completely different distilling batches from the same year that both happened to be aged in 1st fill bourbon barrels.
Same here, wouldn't accept my code from a 2014 bottling either.  Bummer.
What kind of Laddie is it?
Hello hello! Delayed response, I know... can you let me know your batch code and we'll look in to why we don't have a published recipe for you? Happy to chat over email if easier, my address is christy.mcfarlane@bruichladdich.com  Thanks.
No wonder Bruichladdich is so good and interesting, they find some crazy stuff to age their whisky in! Something else neat is that my bottle from 2014 is 7-10 years old, while yours and another one I just found from 2016 are 8-11 years old. Maybe they're working towards older whisky for a 10 year? I hope so, but it could also just be how these batches worked out, and not indicative of anything.


Yeah, I was wondering how common it is to use these different wine casks in standard bottlings. Bruichladdich has always had a delicious, unique character to me. Is that why?
Yeah, I can't believe they have Madeira and whatnot in this (standard?) mix. Crazy shat! Very cool.
Kudos to them for their transparency. 
Ever since Celtic Nations this doesn't surprise me.
Sorry about that, could you pop over your batch code to christy.mcfarlane@bruichladdich.com and we'll have a look into why we don' have a published recipe for you? Many Thanks.

No problem, thanks for the response! I thought to run it through the website one more time before sending you off to look and it appears to be up now. I guess everything wasn't uploaded before the service went live. It was a 14/167 bottle. 19/06/2014

Ankh-Morpork,"So one of my favorite things in a Discworld book are the descriptions about Ankh-Morpork and it's River when we first arrive there in the book. I just started Moving Pictures, and found my favorite one so far:

Mostly everything he writes about Ankh-Morpork is so negative, but it's stuff like this that makes the city so interesting. There's this other layer of scuzzy pride the denizens have of their awful city, maybe like a common bond of suffering or something. It's a city everyone loves to hate. The watch books, and specifically Vimes' character, address these ideas well I think.
Haha I'd forgotten about this one. I love it.

I fear I'm going back to old Ankh Morpork

Although so far away I've tried to roam

And the Smell still hangs thick above Ankh Morpork

The Great Wahoonie's calling me back home


Tried to hitch a ride out to Sto Helit

Gotta try to get further away 

But the Smell still flies high above Ankh Morpork

It drags me nearer every single day


Talk about the Shades in old Ankh Morpork

Speak about the seamstresses and thieves

For the Smell still lurks there above Ankh Morpork

And Ankh Morpork is the one place I can't leave
I know, right?
Op is looking for descriptions of Ankh-Morpork. 
I know it's off topic but there's a joke like this in Going Postal that, I mean, the man could really *commit* to a bit, you know? Like 200 pages of a character named Reacher Gilt before there's a line like ""He suspected Gilt...""
This is from *~~Faust~~ Eric*.
>""It seems all our best go to Ankh-Morpork, where they live in squalor. You leave us dry.""

>[...]

>""I'd wonder... you know, if I was a king... I'd wonder why people were happier living in squalor in Ankh-Morpork than staying back home... sir.""

>""Ah. You're telling me how I should think, now?""

>""No, sir. Just how I think. There's dwarf bars all over Ankh-Morpork, and they've got mining tools wired to the wall, and there's dwarfs in 'em every night quaffing beer and singing sad songs about how they wish they were back in the mountains digging for gold. But if you said to them, fine, the gate's open, off you go and send us a postcard, they'd say, ""Oh, well, yeah I'd love to, but we've just got the new workshop finished... Maybe next year we'll go to Uberwald."" ""

>""They come back to the mountains to die,"" said the King.

>""They live in Ankh-Morpork.""

>""Why is this, do you think?""

>""I couldn't say. Because no one tells them how to, I suppose.""

Train engine isn't worried about a stupid wheel chock,,http://imgur.com/a/alq9e,"I could go for more train work/repair pics on here.
I had to repair a vending machine at the local train shop (KCS in case anyone's wondering - oh, and the vending machine did safety vests, safety glasses, batteries, flashlights, safety beanies, etc.)

THAT would be what they used for THEIR chocks.  Think 1"" solid (concrete filled) posts in a matching receptical in the concrete between the rails ...

(Got to hear them starting a diesel up after a head job on it ... sucker SMOKES like crazy at first!  Also stacks of the electric motors/drive axles ... Neat shop where bigger IS better.)

RwP

Hard hitch? Looks like someone tied onto it a little bit too enthusiastically and bumped it back over the chock. 
One of my engineers has done way worse. Notorious for running over skates, picking switches etc. He's okay on the head end but on a shove he's all throttle and no brake 
dat flex doe
Don't you mean ""Speed bump?""
Nah, they were just jacking it up to get under it
This is actually just a chemical/manufacturing plant, we get railcars like this full of oil for product we make. But I'm with you, trains are cool, and I enjoy checkin these out up close when they're in the building
I'm sure you meant 1' posts? 1"" bump is not going to even register under a train wheel :)
Pretty much. They were delivering a railcar(the other one, closer to the big door) and just shoved this one back a little in the process. I wasn't there when it was delivered, but I'm assuming they didn't even release this cars brakes, or someone would have noticed the chock
since you work on trains maybe you can answer a question for me. I have some tracks near my house, what is the legality of driving on the road marked in blue in this picture?
http://imgur.com/7yCdanp

The red is a service road that follows right along the tracks, the red line stays 40+yards away from the tracks for the most part?
Gotcha. Good to know, and thanks for posting!
I sure did!  *facepalms at self*

RwP

As long as the track wasn't blue/red flagged, it's up to the customer to complain about broken chocks.

Blue/Red flag is instant ""firing"" of the rail crew.  ""Fired"" is a relative term for railroaders.  Just hope their job insurance payments are up to date.
Those chocks are only designed to keep the car from rolling on a flat surface. You tie a locomotive on and that chock won't stop anything if the loco is already moving. BUT if the loco is sitting still and you place two quarters in front of and behind each wheel of the loco while it is stopped it can't get moving. We used to do that to mess with people when they had to move a loco while it was in the shop. 
Really I'm sure it's a no no. It really depends on how far the right of way extends past the guage. If it is railroad property you can bet it's private property. What that means to you as far as legalities changes if it's a class 1 railroad etc. Some people may chase you out some may prosecute. 
You don't need to add a signature to every comment, fucktard. Your username is already above each one. It's not 1987 any more.
I'm not sure what you mean. The chocks weren't broken, more like 'disregarded.' This isn't a railroad building, we have a railspur so we can receive these tankers for bulk oil shipments.
Ah, sort of like when I get a 8mm nut under one of the wheels of my shop creeper.
Darn. Was hoping since it was further away from tracks it wasn't a big deal, there's no signs saying no entry or no trespassing so I was hoping.
Blue tagging is essentially lockout/tagout for the railroads (as much as any 12"" sign can stop a locomotive)
What are you hoping to accomplish by driving there. I mean if your mountain biking it would be less likely you'd catch trouble then if your ripping around on a 4 wheeler. You can try the ""I didn't know"" thing in some cases. The railroad I work with doesn't prosecute unless your putting stuff on the tracks or dumping garbage or stuff like that. But everyone is different
If you're really serious you add a derailed, but the blue/red flags should be enough.
I just want to ride my motorcycle down it. It's got plates so I definitely couldn't run. The maintenance trucks come down the other road (closer to the tracks) pretty often, i'll have to stop next time I see one of them and ask what the deal is.

Asking would be very wise. "

Review#1: Bruichladdich Octomore 4.2,,http://imgur.com/bsioccr,"So here I am with my first ever review after about 5 years of enjoying scotch and 1 year of lurking on this subreddit. Two weeks ago I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/44tn8t/octomore_options/) here looking for advice on purchasing an Octomore, and I want to take this chance to thank everyone who responded for the good advice I recieved. You guys helped convince me (although honestly, I don't think I needed that much convincing) to take the plunge with this bottle. So I thought the least I could do is review it for you. I never bothered reviewing before because I don't feel like I have a real discerning palate, I have trouble picking out specific smells and flavors. I just know what I like when I drink it. But this dram inspired me to give it a try, so here we go. I found it easier to nail down the notes by pouring a bit of my favorite peated go-to Laphroaig 10, and drinking it side by side for comparison if that's ok.


OCTOMORE 4.2 comus, NCF, NCA, peated to 167 ppm and aged 6 years finished in sauternes cask, 61% $220
 

I found this needed very little water for a cask strength, about 1 tsp

**Color:** Light, creamy gold, a richer color than I would have thought for such a young whisky.

**Nose:** Sharp, floral peat. If Laphroaig is a dank, maple peat then this is a more jovial, candy peat. A sweet, yet strong tartness, like green apple with pear. Fruity and citrusy. But a creamy, malty goodness at the same time. So many different things going on at once! There's a ""wine tickle"" to it, the way champaign kind of bubbles in the back of your nose.

**Taste:**The taste is an experience. The sharper notes peak early with a crisp, bubbly tartness, then it slowly melts into this thick, sexy ooze of sweet creamy peat. So much briny peat, yet so fresh and malty, and sweet throughout. I'd say the nose is sharper than the taste, which feels thick and peaty yet fruity. Again, so many different things going on

**Finish:** So long, it's hard to tell where the taste ends and the finish begins. Creamy, buttery peat.

**Conclusion:** So much more going on than just peat bomb. It's very well-rounded while retaining a kind of sweet feistiness, thick and peaty while light and fruity at the same time. So good. 


93/100
This is a hell of a scotch for a first review. Not many options but down from here. 
Thanks for your first review. Any flair requests?
Great review; on par with some of the better ones I've read. 

I haven't tasted the 4.2, but love the 6.3 (current bottle), ten year and even the 6.1!
Thanks for sharing!
God, that's not just any whisky for a first review, I must admit I'm a bit jealous :P Congrats !
Yeah, there's obviously still plenty of scotches out there that I enjoy, but my concern is that this might have ruined other octomores for me. I wanna try another one some time.
 Feel like I may get shit for it, but is ""there's no bad scotch, just better scotch"" too long? 
Thank you much. I'd like to try another octomore sometime. With how diverse the 4.2 is I think it would be interesting to try a straight up peat bomb, and the 6.3 is on my list.
That works."
Octomore Options,"I'm a huge peat head, and a huge bruichladdich fan to boot, so I have really been wanting to try an octomore. I try to keep my monthly whisky budget in about the $100-$200 range, so I decided to just forego buying anything for a few months to justify splurging on an octomore. I've been very good, not having bought anything since christmas except a couple of cheapos (bottle of dickel rye and a bottle of glen moray, i'm only human!). So I'm looking for some advice on which of these available to me I should consider:

4.2 $220

6.1 $160

6.3 $160

7.1 $150

7.3 $160

I'm leaning strongly towards the 4.2 from the reviews I've read, as I really enjoy sweet peat like oogie and a sherried laphroaig IB i've got, plus I think it's a little rarer. But is it worth the extra $60 from the others? As much as I'd like to try the 6's, just reading the reviews of the 4.2 makes my mouth water. I know I should wait til I'm in a city where I could sample some of these (I live in a rural area) but it might be gone by then. Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/44tn8t/octomore_options/,"4.2
4.2
If you want to go for rarity 4.2 is the choice, and it seems to please (having not tried it myself). But if 6.1 and 6.3 are the same price (at the distillery they was 110 & 150 GBP respectively), you should definitely go for 6.3. It IS crazy good, very intense but still much more than only peat. 
4.2 no doubt. Overpriced? Probably, but it's amazing. Worth the premium over the standard ones, for sure. Though 6.3 is crazy good too.
Option c: 7.2
X.2s always. X.1s aren't as interesting and the X.3s are possibly  *too* interesting - personally, I think that there's a higher chance of you not quite liking an X.3 and what a shame that would be.

As mentioned already, the 4.2 is particularly rare but it sounds as though you deserve to treat yourself after forgoing any purchases for a few months. Go for it OP.
You've mentioned you've already decided, but as /u/Slanderousu, /u/TVRaisedMe and /u/DustlessWalnut mentioned, 4.2 is definitely amazing.
From what I have read - 4.2. If they have extras, let me know. Don't think they ship to my state - but they might to my cousin's neighboring state. I'd love to try that. Only had the 1.1
I really want to try 4.2 from all the reviews I've read. Hard to spend that much on a bottle, when you can the standard x.1 which I know I love.
4.2. White whale. 
Why x.2? I've been thinking about picking some up. Whats the difference over x.1?
They just have the one bottle, and the responses here have helped to convince me to go for it. Love your flair btw, I can really relate right now as I ponder putting out all this money for a bottle.
I found that the X.1s were predominantly peaty and smoky. That was their defining characteristic. Nothing much else going on. Good, but I wouldn't pay ¬£150 or however much for them.

The X.3s were very sweet and had a lot more going on than the X.1s but almost *too* much. A small dram was enough. I probably wouldn't have bought one at any cost because I would have struggled to drink it.

The X.2s, however, and especially the 7.2, were just amazing. Smoky without it being the defining feature and sightly sweet with the wine influences really coming through on the palate. Sublime.


I've spent a similar amount of money on bottles I wanted less than 4.2.
Thanks, thats exactly what I needed to know!
LOL.  I've spent way more for bottles I wanted way less ;)"
"dlc level too low, can I fix it?","On my first ever playthrough(ps3), I beat the game now I'm doing the dlc's that came with the game of the year edition. It looks like I may have fucked up by downloading every dlc at the same time because now they are all leveled at 25-30 even though I'm at level 40. I started with tiny tina's dragon keep, which was evenly matched to my level but now I'm doing torgue's crater of badassitude and all the missions, enemies and loot are level 30. I haven't initiated any of the other dlc's but I can see a few in the ""my missions"" menu and they are leveled at 25 and 30. Is it just badassitude that's leveled low for some reason, and if not is there some way to reinstall them? I gotta say it sucks just wandering around killing everybody with a couple shots, and never finding any good loot. Thanks in advance",https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands2/comments/428l8d/dlc_level_too_low_can_i_fix_it/,"You could continue to explore so you can soak up lore or go in to TVHM for another story playthrough.

The Hammerlock and Tiny Tina DLCs scale 30-35.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ha4n4/a_definitive_guide_on_dlc_level_scaling_and_when/) I think that is equivalent to 40-50 for TVHM.

Suggest you get the Magic Missile grenade in TTAODK, then whiz through TVHM.

At the end of TVHM you should be 50. Go to UVHM right away because TVHM gear caps at 50 and UVHM scales to *your level* and above.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/3yy1y1/new_borderlands_player_tips_pls/cyhm23d
switch to tvhm
I'm not sure I want to do another playthrough. If I switch to TVHM will I be good to play the dlc's more evenly matched? Will my progress in the dragon keep dlc be lost (There's a few side missions I need to complete still)? And what is lore?
Borderlands games are designed for multiple playthroughs. NVHM is ""training mode"". TVHM is ""standard mode"". UVHM is ""challenge mode"".

Lore refers to background information related to the story and Borderlands universe.

When you load a character via ""Select Character"" menu, you can choose any play mode you have unlocked. All missions associated with that play mode remain as they were last time you were in that play mode. So you could go back to those TTAODK side missions by choosing NVHM.

As for DLCs from TVHM, I do not recommend it and I am not sure how well it would work. My guess is that the pirate and Torgue DLC would be fine. Suggest you back up your character save file to USB before trying it out. That way you can restore if the test is unsatisfactory.
It's a hella fun game, but there's moments of terror and stress I don't care to relive, especially if they're even harder. Threshers, constructors, and the caustic caverns come to mind. Oh and sawtooth cauldron, I don't even want to know what all those are like on a higher difficulty, I just want to finish all the dlc's.
I can clue you in: they are fun!

Part of what makes them hard at the beginning is a combination of low gear, low skills, and player learning. As equipment selection gets more appropriate, skills & health increase, and you learn how to play the character & game ... it gets better.

There are a lot of ways to enjoy Borderlands. Play it any way you like. It is your game and nobody is harmed. I only suggest that you leave a little curiosity for other ways to play so you might experiment some time in the future. (I just started melee last week after years of avoiding it).
Fair enough, thanks for all the info. Maybe I'll start a TVHM and see if it hooks me

Wondering about going to a Lakers game,"Sorry in advance if this isn't the right place to post this. A little ""life story"": My grandma is a huge Lakers fan, and has been since they were in Minnesota, where she's originally from. She's 85, and never seen them play. She's been trying to get out more and do stuff since my grandpa died last year, and it occurred to me that I should take her to a Lakers game. I'm not into basketball, and I've never been to any kind of sports game, so I was wondering if there's anything I should know or any tips for a better experience. [This](http://www.nba.com/lakers/tickets/individual?ls=tickets_central) looks like the place to buy ticks. I have not consulted with her yet on if there's a certain game she'd be more keen on, but tickets get pretty expensive so might have limited choice anyway. Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/3wp7in/wondering_about_going_to_a_lakers_game/,"At times it gets pretty loud. I would suggest earplugs if she dislikes loud noises. Awesome experience overall, especially if its a close game. Also get there early to avoid the congestion of the crowds.
I'd highly suggest you bring her there and also have you to enjoy the game, especially this farewell tour for him where the fans will finally and truly appreciate seeing him

I'd suggest you take her in the premier sections, they're about 60-100or+(each)  dollars depending who they're playing, bc of your grandmothers age, i do not suggest going towards the section 300s, they have narrowed stairs and she might have a hard time seeing the court ( players are much faster live than on TV ).

enjoy the game , warms my heart to see :

1.Grandson does good deeds 
2.seeing long time laker fans
3.maybe this game might turn you into liking basketball ?

300 sections
Worst seats, best fans.

Foods too expensive. Dont waste your time, if you do go loaded.

Find out where youre seated and how to get to your seat before you get there. Staples will make you go in a complete circle around the whole arena if you go the wrong direction, you dont want your grandma waking that.
If you get 300 section seats, tell the usher of that section that your grandma can't walk up and down the section, they could possibly change you seats to accessible seating section. Be easier for you guys. 

Source: use to work as an usher at the Staples Center and they will usually do this things for you. 
It is tough right now to get a good deal because of this being Kobe's last year. Everybody is trying to get their last glimpse of Kobe live before he calls it a career. I would add stubhub on you list as well. Weekday games always less than Friday-Sunday games. 
Have you been to the staples center? Are the high up seats even worth going for, or is it too hard to see anything?
Yeah, I'm worried that with kobe retiring it might make it hard to go this season, but i'm gonna try. I still gotta talk about it with my grandma this weekend, hopefully it's not too late. She's actually in pretty good shape for her age, i'm not too worried about the stairs, and everyone else here seems to think the 300's are still a good view. I will try to get closer though. Thanks for the help, and the kind words. 
Worst seats in the house yeah, but still great seats. You can still see everything perfectly fine.
yeah, a lot of the high cost of concessions and beer is true of concerts too, thanks.
How did you get a job at Staples? As in, where do you apply?
Went to a game 2 years ago, first row of the 300s. It's not a bad seat, you can still see everything perfectly fine even without looking at the big screen. 
The 304 section is usually the place I sit everytime I go against the concrete wall at the very top. Some people talk major shit about those seats but they are fine. You can still see the game perfectly fine and it's not like the court or people look like ants.

I will say however that being afraid of heights, it was pretty fucking scary (to me at least, no one else seemed to have a problem) being up that high. The seats and steps of the nosebleeds are pretty steep too. By the end of the game though I'm perfectly fine and will run down those steps.
I was there in November vs the Nuggets up in the rafters 300 section literally next to the banners and yet the view was still amazing 
Good to know, thanks for the info
Staples is a really, really nice arena to watch games in. "
[everyday math]percentage problem,"So I'm a scotch drinker, and for those who don't know it's normal practice to slightly water down good whisky to ""open up"" the flavors. I came across some interesting info that the perfect ratio of alcohol to water for tasting is 35%, and even though I am not experiencing any trouble whatsoever when it comes to enjoying my single malt I thought it would be an interesting experiment to try this and see how it compares to my method of just adding a ""wee bit"" of water. So if i pour a dram (60 ml) of whisky that is 43% alcohol/57% water out of the bottle, how much water do I need to add to bring the alcohol content to 35%? And since whisky can vary in proof (anywhere from 40% to 60+% alcohol) what is the formula for determining how much water to add?",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/3nakqd/everyday_mathpercentage_problem/,"We have to add x ml of water such that (x+0.57\*60) / (60+x) = 0.65

In the numerator we are summing the added water (x) with the water already in the whisky (57% of 60ml) and in the denominator we have the total amount of liquid.  We set this to 0.65 since this is the water content when the alcohol content is 0.35.

For your particular example when we solve for x we get that we need to add 96/7 or about 14ml of water.  You can use this formula more generally by replacing the appropriate numbers.
how did you ""solve for x"" and get 96 divided by 7? Sorry, I was never good at math. I remember the struggle of learning these equations in middle school 20 years ago, and the triumph of finally getting it, but I apparently didn't retain it.
In algebra the goal is to isolate the variable (the x) so that it is alone on one side of the equation, that way you can see what it alone is equal to.

So start with (x+0.57\*60) / (60+x) = 0.65

First break up the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by the denominator.  The left side cancels and you're left with just the numerator.

x+0.57\*60 = 0.65\*(60+x)

Now lets simplify it a bit by performing the multiplication on each side.

x+34.2 = 39+0.65x

Now we combine the x'es by subtracting 0.65x from both sides and we will have x-0.65x which is 0.35x.

0.35x + 34.2=39

Next subtract 34.2 from both sides to combine the  two numbers not attached to a variable.

0.35x = 4.8

Finally, to isolate x, we divide by 0.35 on both sides. The 0.35 on the x cancels and we get

x = 4.8/0.35

That division can be done on a calculator and you get about 13.7.
well thank you for the quick reply yesterday, I was wanting to try it out. Discovered 35% alcohol is a little to watered down for my taste, I like the concentrated flavors and that whisky bite. I find that what I've been tending towards is more like 45% alcohol, so I can use that same equation on a bottle of cask strength Laphroaig which is 59% alcohol, and find I need to add about 18.7 ml of water to achieve 45% alcohol content. All this dilution discussion reminds me of a quote I love: Technically, alcohol is a solution. Thanks again!"

I love the flex couplings I get to use from time to time, less need to precisely align the motor. When the floor is bouncing enough to shake a motor that weighs 1000 pounds plus, you are not going to get an acceptable alignment on it, especially when it has no jacking bolts. 
I'm as suprised as Veritas1123, an operator who knows what his equipment does!  Very nice.  Fellow engineer in a manufacturing plant.

I've had operators with 20+ years in ask me how to run their own equipment.  I tell them I've only been here 5 years, you knew how to run before I showed up, so figure it out.
We use these couplers on air movers. The black ones are rubber and the orange ones are plastic with the grooves dictating the shear strength.
As an engineer at a chemical plant i applaud you as an operator for actually understanding the equipment you use! So many of my operators just do whatever they are told so they can go home at 3 without putting any thought in. Now excuse me while i go find out why we blew a rupture disc last night.
Are they made of phenolic?

How the hell does this happen? 
Oops, meant to reply to you and posted it as a comment.
Lovejoys
I'm guessing its job is to reduce vibration or loading on the bearings, and to be a sacrificial coupling so the pump/motor aren't damaged in an instance like this. See the way it sheared off the top-most set of teeth?
The 3 phase electric motor is off-screen to the left, it bolts directly to the little gearbox(motor and gearbox are grey). The gearbox reduces the speed of the motor down to about 120 rpm for lots of power to pump thick grease. And the pump is the blue unit with the piping. [Here's](http://imgur.com/H5GVleN) another angle.
Thanks! It's easy to quickly tell who I can actually ask questions and learn something and who I need to just forget what they tell me. Thought about going to school for chemical engineering for sure because of my interest in learning the how and why.
TIL, thanks!
Rupture disc?  On what, refrigeration system?  Or something else?

A few years before I got to my plant, they blew a rupture disc on a 500 ton chiller by running the pump in the evaporator section for days while the chiller was off.  Water eventually heated up enough to heat the refrigerant past the limit on the disc, and boom, lots of R123 out in the air.  Like watching money just burn in front of you.
My guess is you had an over pressure situation. :D Sorry, couldn't help myself. 
Thanks! I try because it helps with troubleshooting, and its very interesting to learn for me personally. You're right, though, good operators are few and far between. They're just there to collect a paycheck, but I don't want to stay entry level so anything they let me put hands or eyes on, I'll be out there.
Coupling worked itself loose and eventually came apart. Destroyed the shroud and coupler, as well as rounding out the shaft. Set screw issues it seems. 
That's what I was thinking, that it might be a shear section to prevent pump/motor damage
I wish it always worked like that, but I've seen shafts and keys shear with rubber couplers unscathed

What are you guys pumping? That looks almost like an end suction but beefier.
This looks familure. This wouldn't happen to be at the citgo plant in Oklahoma, would it?
If you've got the drive to do it, definitely give it a go.  Engineering school is hard work, but worth it with the career opportunities and quite rewarding if you truly love learning how things work.
Ouch, at least it wasn't an ammonia refrigeration system! No, nothing that serious. One of our non-code production vessels so it's just a 15 psi disc. My current theory is that they decided to boil the vessel out to clean it between production runs and forgot to open the vent line. Now usually there's documentation of boil-outs but i cant find that anywhere, so someone probably did it without being told to. I'll find out more when the second shift supervisor gets in.
No

As a maintenace mechanic, very often my job involves investigating to find out why something actually broke since I won't get the full or real story from the operators, i feel you

Noob question,"So I'm playing borderlands 2 for the first time ever, on ps3, and I don't quite understand how the saving works. I'm on the ""best minion ever"" mission, and I was right at the fight with Captain Flynt. There's a machine with an antenna on it just before the boss area that saves the game when I get near it, so I thought I was safe turning off the game here. But next time I went to play, It spawned me way back at liars berg, at the bounty board/fast travel station, and I had to fight my way all the way back to Flynt. What good are these ""save station"" things if it doesn't remember your spot, and how do you know where you'll spawn the next time if you have to stop playing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands2/comments/3k6jub/noob_question/,"Those are for respawning when/if you die in that area. When you quit out, you're placed at the begining of whichever area you quit out of.
You spawn at the location of the last Fast Travel you used. This includes area travel. Say you travel between areas by driving to the entrance to an area and entering that way, where you enter will be where you spawn when reloading. The most common place to come back to would be wherever you last fast traveled to though since that is the easier way of getting around.
Those are for respawns when u die
What you're mistaking for fast travel and spawn stations are actually Hyperion New-U machines! They out you back together when u die. 

DISCLAIMER: you forfeit any right to reproduce after using these machines! 
It is a minor con to this game compared to others, but what I can say is this, if you ever play through a side quest and or mission, and your near the next destination of interest, as in YOUR interest, I highly recommend you lobby on through till your at your next ""Motel"" as the saying goes lol, this way when you do leave for a brief or perhaps long break, when you return to have ""breakfast"" is another saying, you will be left off where you last saved at that destination, if you want any more tips just private message me your PSN ID and can walk you through the game on anything you need to know about Borderlands 2."
Scotch to stock up on,"I keep seeing people here talk about whiskys that are being discontinued or replaced with NAS versions. I have a few bottles of Nadurra 16 that I'm putting away, and wish that I had done the same with the Laddie 10, which I loved.

Buying every fleeting bottle seems like a fool's errand to me.
Only the ones you like.
Why bother. Great whisky is being produced all the time, and it always will. Why not broaden your horizons instead of stockpiling the same whisky?
Laphroaig 15 might be discontinued at the end of the year.
johnnie walker green, its only available for 2015 year
Glendronach 15, age statement nikka ( yoichi!), ec12 maybe? Surely it can't stay cheap forever, glenfarclas 1l 105 a webshop in the benelux has it currently on offer, 2 for 52 euro!


I'll second the current Glendronach 15.  You can read about what makes it such a good whisky, as well as a good buy, and why you might want to stock up on it here - http://wordsofwhisky.com/glendronach-is-a-lot-older-than-the-label-says/

(edit to add this link, as well) - http://maltandoak.com/glendronach-15-is-it-the-best-buy-in-the-world-of-whisky/
Glendronach 15 seems to be a popular choice.
I was just kind of wondering if there was something I really like or something specific I've been meaning to try that I should check out before it's gone. Like I said, I wish I had got a few bottles of laddie ten, as it's one that I particularly enjoyed. Granted, I still thoroughly enjoy the rocks and islay barley, so maybe you have a point
I agree, it depends on what you like.  It also seems to depend on where you live--ie, a few years ago when, IIRC, Johnnie Walker Green was discontinued in the US, but not in Asia.
How can something that was only ever a 'limited' release become discontinued?
Where is the Glenfarclas 105 that cheap!?
You and the article you linked to have convinced me to go out and buy a bottle of the Glendronach 15! According to the article, if it is correct, I got a 2014 bottling of the 15 year old, meaning It may be as old as 19 years. That would be the oldest single malt I'll drink. Regardless, I understand all the Glendronach love now. Thanks for the info!
I wasn't aware, looks like it's only for 3 years though til aging stocks replenish. I actually have an open bottle now. Been wanting to try it for a while, used the community review as an excuse to finally get it. I'll either try to make the bottle last or buy another.
The way I was introduced to the 15 was that it was replacing the 18; and that it would likely continue after 2015. Now I hear mixed things about it, which makes me think it'll be discontinued. So either I got bad info or Laphroaig was waiting to make up their mind.
Drankdozijn.nl look at their weekly offers, i know it's mental. 

2 liter 60 abv for 52 euro, i don't i've seen a better deal on whisky before.

Hmm...and you've used them before? If yes, where are you based? I've been considering using whiskysite.nl but am worried about being hit by customs charges. I'm based in the UK.
That's what I'm afraid of. I've got a bottle of 15 being delivered tomorrow. I'm going to make it last as long as possible.

What to do with Utility Stocks,"My grandpa died a year ago, and one of the sources of income he left to my grandma was a ""utility stock."" She also worded it as ""preferred and/or utility stock(?)."" It's worth about $175,000, which is up $50,000 since they started it about 20 years ago. She's concerned because it suddenly lost $10,000 in the last month, and doesn't know what to do. She's considering a ""money market (bank) account."" I don't know what a ""utility/preferred stock"" is, or a ""money market account,"" I told her since she's up 50k just cash it out. But she really loves me and values my opinion even though I don't know much about this particular subject, so I thought of this subreddit for some advice.

A money market account is just a fancy name for a savings account.

As for what a utility stock is, I'm guessing it's just stock in the local utility company.  I'd tell her to see it and put it into a more diversified mutual fund.  Recommend she get an index fund from vanguard.
Don't rush to sell it. It depends on what grandma's basis is. If it was truly willed to her, then her basis may be stepped up to last year's price. But if it was joint property, then selling it will incur a 50k taxable gain. Find out the amount of the preferred dividend, it may be providing income she depends on and it will probably be much higher than anything she can get investing in bonds right now. That dividend is probably dependable, which means you can relax a bit about fluctuations in the stock price and just never sell it.

Post back here if you learn the dividend amount...


It is a joint property. The checks fluctuate, sometimes she gets 1 a month and sometimes she gets 2. They range anywhere from $300 or below to $1700. Is that the preferred dividend? Don't know if it's a ""dependable dividend"" 
You need to find out what the annual income is and compare to the income you could get if you sell and buy a diversified fund of corporate bonds or dividend stocks, and whether it's worth it to pay $7,500 in capital gains taxes to make that switch."
Has anyone ever attended a Whisky Live event?,"Was told that it's good, thinking of going to the one in L.A. on Nov 6. It's $129, and says it covers ""food and whisky sampling event."" Doesn't say how much you can sample or what, but lots of great distilleries are there, and a guy I talked to who went last year had a great time and is going again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/3gbsqx/has_anyone_ever_attended_a_whisky_live_event/,"I went to the one last year in LA with my wife and some friends, and we all had a blast.

I think it was about $10 extra, but was worth the entertainment and provided a good introduction for my wife, who mostly prefers wine and other spirits. 

Depends on your experience level, but for me it was great. I was able to try many different things I'd wanted to try, but hadn't gotten around to purchasing yet. It also saved me from a few I didn't need to buy after trying!

We didn't try anything too rare, except a 25-year (can't remember which right now, sorry...) from the LA Whisky Society.   Glenlivet had their Archive and Guardians Chapter, which was fun to try. 

As for limits, we stayed from open until close and weren't cut off at all.  Pours were reasonable, and the crowd wasn't bad at all. Also of note, you couldn't buy there if you found something you really enjoyed, but the flip side is that there weren't any ""gotchas"" once you got in the door either--no one tried to sell us anything which was nice. 

I'd recommend eating beforehand though, as the food was pretty underwhelming.

I've been to the one in Boston. It's not bad. It's not the mayhem that Whisky Advocate's events are, but that's not a bad thing. Really depends on who is pouring (doesn't it always). But I found it nice to be able to spend more time and talk to folks. We didn't eat the food, went for dinner after.
You'll have to gauge how busy it will be. The London ones are always packed to the point that walking around between stands is difficult, and a lot of whisky goes out of stock on the first day.

Also, be ruthless about the list of vendors who will be there. I've been to one where there weren't any big brands, and honestly, it was a bit shit. I'm not a corporate shill, but when Diageo, PR, Beam Suntory, or Grants are all not there - that doesn't leave much good stuff. 

They often leave it very late to announce the list of exhibitors, and even then, I've been to one where at least one of the exhibitors advertised had pulled out, and wasn't there, so wait until they announce the exhibitors, and unless they advertise a lineup with multiple brands you like or want to try, don't bother. 

Edit: just saw the exhibitor list, looks quite good actually.


> The London ones are always packed to the point that walking around between stands is difficult

Yes! We (our band of merry men) switched our annual pilgrimage from WL to the TWE show partly because WL moved to that cooped up Honourable Artillery club. It was relaxed and spacey at the Hurlingham plus we could go enjoy a cigar with a malt on the lawns but that HA club is just like a well decorated rats cage. Great art but who wants to sample whisky banging elbows with the next table while being buffeted by the stream of people squeezing by. On top of that the army guys do the security so its like being back at school. Despite it being advertised as set in a six acre garden going near their very well kept lawn prompted two army types from different directions descending upon us...uh oh so we wont sit on the grass then, I think its a shooting offence.

Been happy at the TWE show since then, more expensive but the dream drams are amazing and its a freer environment (despite there being no lawn at all at vinopolis), plus this year its all change to the new Billingsgate event space. I do hope the malt doesnt taste of fish! :)
Will they tend to have more rare and unusual offerings, or just samplings of the standard bottlings?
Check out http://www.thewhiskylounge.com/ as well, they do good london events. The London whisky weekender this past April was the best tasting event I've ever been to.
I've never encountered anything that wasn't easy to find. Diageo usually bring the talisker 25 if talisker are going.

Independant bottlers will sometimes have older/rarer stuff. That boutiquey whisky company brought some cool stuff to the london 2014 event

I have too much fun reading pratchett,"I have way too much fun reading discworld books. I've read 10 so far, in no particular order. I'll read 2 or 3 in a row(or in the case of Pyramids twice in a row, the only time I had ever done that with a book), then feel like I need to stop cuz I'm enjoying it too much. Like books shouldn't be this much fun. So i'll read some other stuff, looking forward to my next discworld book. It's at the point sometimes where any books I read feels like it's just a break from discworld. It's not fair to other authors how fucking fun pratchett is. Anyone else feel this way? Do I just need to be true to myself and go on a pratchett binge?",https://www.reddit.com/r/discworld/comments/3blen9/i_have_too_much_fun_reading_pratchett/,"Pratchett destroyed fantasy for me. I can't read any other fantasy books anymore because I keep thinking of the consequences of flying horses, or unquenchable fire. Not even mad.
Yeah, and the thing is, they never stop being awesome. On your 15th read through of a book, all of a sudden a joke or reference will jump out at you, and you'll laugh and think ""OMG, i can't believe I missed that, that's hilarious!"" 

It's magic. 
For maximum Discworld exposure you should listen to them over and over too. If you're like me and think you missed some jokes, audiobooks expose so many more puns ÔººÔºàÔø£Ô∏∂Ôø£ÔºâÔºè
Read Good Omens, and segue into Neil Gaiman for a bit.
I read the majority of the series about once a year.
I really liked Pyramids. I'm sad he never re-visited those characters.
> in the case of Pyramids twice in a row

Ironic, considering the 'ending' of Dios' story.
I'm currently reading (re-reading) the series. Thought I might read a few then something else in between. But I've forgone all other books for months now. 
Same. I pretty much constantly reread Discworld novels when there isn't something else occupying my reading time. I'll usually read a few Discworld books before finding something else. Although the Thursday Next books by Jasper Fforde have made it into my regular rotation. 
I lead a really busy life and it really is difficult to find a place where reading fits into all that. I am a *huge* Pratchett fan and read many books a few years back when I was still in school, but nowadays I may be able to only fit in a few pages when I take a bus on an irregular trip somewhere.

On the way back from one of these irregular trips I didn't have any books on me at all, but my train was cancelled and it was going to be at least 3 hours until the next one, so I found a local book shop and nonchalantly headed straight for the Pratchett shelf and picked up a copy of The Truth. I read it cover to cover in both the 3 hour wait at the station and the 3 hour train journey home. 

They really are so much fun.
Pyramids is packed full of stupid puns and I love it.
Binge. I've been binging for a good couple of months and working my way through his books by publication order. Just finished Unseen Academicals and I'm not regretting it one bit. 
Do you read The Dresden Files? They're not Pratchett, but he does ride a zombie Tyrannosaurus through Chicago to defeat an army of zombies once. It didn't corner well, he smashed quite a few cars. Polka will never die.
yeah, I read a clive barker book recently with this nightmare realm of otherworldly, lovecraftian creatures, supposed to be horrifying. I kept laughing thinking about rincewind in the dungeon dimension
Totally agree. On the downside, if I hadn't read the books before listening to them, I would have missed the Piecemaker pun.
How do audiobooks deal with the footnotes?

Does it read them as a parenthetical or what? If it doesn't include them I feel like half the humor of his writing would be lost.
Same with Small Gods. So much untapped potential in Omnia.
If I was actually able to pick a favorite this might be it. My dad is a freemason and really into egyptology stuff, I've been trying to get him to read it. I feel like the more seriously someone takes the subject matter the more benefit they'll get from pratchett mocking it.
That's how I ended up rereading it. The beginning was a little odd, but it makes sense after the ending. So I started reading it now that I understood, and before I knew it I didn't want to stop and kept going.
I'm reading the whole series for the first time, but also like to throw something different in between the books. Either some gritty new fantasy, or hard scifi..
My favorite was the pronunciation of IIa and IIb. I laughed so loud I scared my cat. 
I haven't, but I've seen them around - I'll add these to my reading list, thanks!
Imajica? 'Cause that's like my favorite book, ever.
The ones I have (slowly building my collection) all have the foot note read with a ""echo-ey, ghosty"" tone of voice so it's clearly a step back from the story.  

The Nigel Planer ones are read parenthetically, but I'm not sure about the other ones.
His ""stand alone"" books are always my favorites. I'm marathing through his books, and of the first 12 books I read, my favorites were Mort, Pyramids, and Small Gods. They were chock full of great characters who were never revisited, but they also seemed to wrap themselves up more nicely. What seemed more sad to me was when I realized that there will never be a Raising Taxes book, a continuation for Mr Nutt in the dark country, or a story for when Vimes finally retires and Carrot will have to take on more power because it seems like there were so many more hints of what was going to happen. 
Reading *Carpe Jugulum* does bring back some of Small Gods though. But it's not the same. 
I've gotten the impression that Pratchett mostly parodied things that he actually enjoyed, which makes the jokes so much more effective than those in parodies that make fun of subjects that the author despises.
I can second that recommendation. They're a bit darker than Pratchett, but they're well written and incredibly funny. 

I'd advise skipping the first two books until you're committed to the series, though, Butcher was still figuring out what exactly he wanted to do with the story so the writing isn't nearly as strong as it is in books 3 and on. 
The great and secret show. But my clive-barker-fanboy friend who got me to read it is kinda obsessed with imajica, so i'll have to give it a read after i'm done with the art trilogy. I think that was his plan all along though, to break me into clive and then give me imajica.

They are on audible! Maybe they can send you some of them with the new audio encoding through clacks.

That little bit about image encoding in Monstrous Regiment is the best reference ever. Like, it doesn't have to be there, but it's there, and as an engineer it feels like pterry is just winking directly at me. Oh god.
My favorites are the Watchmen and Death series, but the ""cultures of discworld"" are a really close third.

>What seemed more sad to me was when I realized that there will never be a Raising Taxes book, a continuation for Mr Nutt in the dark country, or a story for when Vimes finally retires and Carrot will have to take on more power because it seems like there were so many more hints of what was going to happen.

Well, on the flip side, the fact that it was never written means you can imagine it to be whatever you want it to be. I'd much prefer a real book exploring it, but the fact that he established such a vibrant universe and that we can speculate endlessly is a decent consolation prize, I suppose.
I concur. I actually started with *Dead Beat*, because that's the one a friend handed to me, but I'm glad (even though lots of things got subtly spoiled for me) because I was really invested in the series right away instead of interest petering out after the mediocre first two.
That's how I am acquiring them, slowly but surely. It's sadly a question of cost (spending my summer as an unemployed student). I love them. I introduced my boyfriend to Pratchett via books from audible (Nation as a start, not discworld but still excellent ). 
You honestly didn't miss very much. A few characters are introduced, but most of them aren't very important until later (Thinking of Morgan and Susan primarily, but to a lesser extent Bob and Marcone), and they get fleshed out significantly in later novels. 
That thing with Thomas was certainly spoiled for me. That was the big one. I went back to book #1 and was like ""...where's Thomas?"" And then #3 rolls around and I gasped.

Also Mouse sticking around. 
I forgot about Thomas, crap. That actually is a fairly important one. "

Extra inner-cylinder cooling on 93 toyota pickup,,http://imgur.com/NVhp3x3,"Notice how the head gasket is fine? Coolant corroded through exhaust port on head. One minute everything's fine, then out of nowhere the truck turned into a fog machine.
Poor man's methanol injection, until it overheats and blows the engine.
Unless you drain the block, and heads, you are going to get coolant in the cylinders when you remove the cylinder head. I'm not saying that's what happened, but it could be interpreted as such.
3vz? np clean it up and replace the gaskets. good to go...for a time
The pistons have an almost happy face complete with almost eyebrows. :)
Just trying to cure a lean condition?
I was going to say the gasket looked fine. Interesting on the head issue.
I spent 3 minutes looking for the gasket breach before bothering to check the comments, glad I'm not insane for not seeing it.  Did you mange to get it off before it hydro-locked?  
The passages in the block look pretty clean, any idea if this was a remanufactured replacement? 
Likely a result of using cheap coolant instead of Toyota Red.
> Coolant corroded through exhaust port on head.

Holy shit!
The coolant corroded into the exhaust port on the number 5 cylinder (the most flooded one, far left).
There was no damage (other than the minor issue of a bunk head). Maybe since leak was in exhaust port the cylinder was exhaling when exposed to coolant, eliminating danger
It's my truck, had 120k on it when i got it and has 170k now. original motor as far as i know
This was my thought. Always used napa green, and I've been having more and more issues with napa parts at work anyway. I'm switching to toyota red
I have to disagree with you on this issue.  As long as you do a good flush, then run green.  Make sure that it does not have oats though.  I have ben seeing quite a bit of Toyota red causing sediment issues in radiators. 
How the fuck did it get corroded ? CS mixed prestone with salted water?
Fun thing : old engines used Toyota Green coolant :-P
Toyota Red will not cause sediment if it is mixed only with distilled water and put into a clean engine that has been flushed with distilled water. Problems arise when people top their coolant off with tap water or worse, other types of coolant. 
Toyota Green is/was not exactly like regular cheap green though and Red has been approved for use in engines that shipped with Green. 
I have seen fresh flushes from the dealership have sediment in a year. 
That one is good to know....especially since old engines tended to use different metals for the block and the head
It depends on what kind of ""sediment"" we're talking about here. A little brown stuff in the bottom of the radiator is totally normal for any engine with an iron block especially, but I'm talking about the stuff that sticks to the inside of hoses and such. Red doesnt cause that buildup if used properly. 
Right. Most Toyota truck engines in general have iron blocks and aluminum heads in the first place. Some really old trucks also had copper radiators which were welded. Green coolant eats the welds. 
Same thing for car engines....the 4A series actually use a aluminum head and cast iron block"
