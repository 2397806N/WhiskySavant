Review #60 - Ardnamurchan AD/ - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/bmth610skzpc1.jpeg,"Review #60 -Ardnamurchan AD/ (Batch 022221) - 46% ABV

Nose: Barley sugars, hay, dunnage/earth, rotting wood, stone fruits, oyster shells, hint of campfire

Palate: medium mouthfeel. Sea salt, brine, tropical fruits, old machinery, sweet oak, and just a smidge of that earthy peat shining through 

Finish: medium-long finish. Tropical fruits again, oak, sea salt, with a little pepper and crème brûlée 

Final Thoughts: saw a bottle of this on clearance sale at a local store for $44 USD, and got the last bottle. It’s a banger. Coastal highland style with a kick of peat, alcohol perfectly integrated, extremely flavorful for what I chase, great blending, NCF, natural color and 46%. What more could I ask for. This is an instant buy at this price. Highly recommend. Sure, I’d love a few more proof in this bottle, but I’ve got some cask strength ardnamurchan already and for $44, this is fan-friggin-tastic.

Thanks for the review, I've been eyeing this one to break into Ardnamurchan
Woah $44 is nuts for the quality of this bottle. That's essentially half of what a full priced bottle goes for in my area. Also seeing Ardnamurchan on clearance is wild. Pouring some this evening and a cheers to you!
Totally agree. Such a great scotch. I think I coincidentally also gave mine an 86! Or somewhere thereabouts.
Mid 80s certainly, if I bought it for 44 bucks it's in the low 90s"

Nose: assorted berries, brown sugar, old wood, earth/dunnage, gunpowder, and a little bit of a struck match

Palate: medium-thin mouthfeel. pepper, baking spices, astringent & bitter oak, old dates, plums and other typical sherry cask notes. 

Finish: medium-long finish. Berries return, then turn into a drying oak to wrap it up. 

Final Thoughts: definitely something a little funky going on with this sherry cask. It has just a hint of the sulfur, but almost like the sulfur was actually burnt off and the char remained. But, it actually works with this dram and I’m generally a fan of a few off notes.  This cask was a mediocre cask at best, but the distillate was able to do some salvage on it. Definitely will enjoy a dram of this here and there, but not something I’d buy again.

Review #58 - Stranahan’s 10 year Rocky Mountain Angel - American Single Malt,,https://i.redd.it/e1vkh1naq9jc1.jpeg,"Review #58 - Stranahan’s 10 year Rocky Mountain Angel - 45.1% ABV

Nose: classic bourbon notes mixed with barley sugars. Caramel, sweet oak, brown sugar, hay, honey. 

Palate: medium-thin mouthfeel. Palate very similar to the nose. Caramel, oak, brown sugar, bourbon-esque, maybe with a little cherry thing going on. 

Finish: medium finish. The oak, brown sugar, and caramel lingers. 

Final Thoughts: If Glenfiddich moved to Kentucky, this is what you’d get. It really is like a cross between scotch and bourbon and taste like I took a swig of Glen and Blanton’s at the same time. If you love bourbon, right up your alley. If you tend to favor the more savory character of many scotches, than this may be a little too American for you.  Personally, I wanted the barley to dominate far more than it did, and the result is far too much like a mediocre bourbon to me. 

It really is interesting to see what barley and a fairly typical scotch process results in when you put this distillate in American oak at high elevation. The barley note is definitely there, but the new oak overpowers and I feel that some of the character and complexity may be lost with the 45.1% ABV. Would have been interesting to try this at cask strength.

Thanks for the review!

Interesting take on this as far as the summary and final score go. I don't disagree with most of your qualitative statements and the tasting notes sound pretty similar to mine and yet I felt this was pretty satisfying for someone like myself who used to mainly drink scotch before discovering ASMW. Not saying I felt it was incredible but maybe circa 80/100 +/- 2

I guess it's a good thing there's so much variety in ASMW. Different things fit different palates!"

Finish: medium-short finish. Now return the grapes and pepper, with a bit of dry oak tannins. 

Final Thoughts: this is an old picture. I went through the bottle over the past 9+ months or so. It improved dramatically as the bottle went down. I was not a fan when I first cracked the bottle, as the ethanol was too prominent and not integrated. As the bottle progressed, it turned into quite a treat. Great cognac, glad I had it, but wouldn’t search for another.

Review #56 - Edradour 10 Year (Signatory 2012) - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/mtqeco9ply9c1.jpeg,"Review #56 - Edradour 10 Year (Signatory 2012) - 46% ABV

Nose: Maple syrup, caramel, red wine, musty library books, dunnage, overripe berries

Palate: medium mouthfeel. Red wine right off the bat. Like a nice red blend and less like a sherry. Brown sugar, old leather, balsamic, a bit of salt, light baking spices

Finish: medium finish. The spices completely fade away and transform into red wine, sweet oak, earth. 

Final Thoughts: For what this is (an affordable 10-year, sherry-matured single malt), it’s fantastic. The alcohol is almost perfectly integrated and the dram as a whole is wildly balanced. It definitely delivers that red wine note, but still lets you know it’s a scotch with some funk and earth to it. For me, this is one of the great “bang-for-your-buck” scotches out there right now. I much prefer bourbon-matured scotches, and this one had me reevaluated my biases over the past year. Highly recommend. 

Final Score: 86/100
It’s not exactly a bargain in my local market, ~$90, but I really enjoy this one as well. There’s not a major difference between it and the Caledonia in my opinion
I loved this bottle, and I don’t remember paying more than ~$70 USD for it.  So I’d call that a good price too.
Love that Edradour ‘funk’.
This is a great bottle but I personally find it to be almost too sweet for my preference. I’ve put a decent dent in the bottle I have but I’m finding it too syrupy for all but the occasional dram. Wondering if my palate is shot due to too many peated scotches or if others find it the same.
All the nose is spot on for me. It smells and looks like it is going to be amazing. I get a really muted taste though. One night I thought I was liking it better and better like I had just got a break through. I had a something else sherried straight after and was punched in the face with flavour compared to the edradour
Have you tried the 12 Caledonia? It's my favourite Edradour so far.
If you like peat, the Ballechin range is excellent outside of the entry 10 year old
I was going to ask about this. The specs and notes seem pretty damn similar to Caledonia, and Signatory already owns Edradour. I’m just wondering what’s the business argument is in releasing this.
Sweet? I found it quite astringent, to the extent I prefer the 40% version.
Honestly, I’m as confused as you are especially when also considering the “OB” 10yr. It’s a single cask release, but if the cask is so solid why not fold it into the standard range…?
Huh, I didn’t get any astringent notes at all. But yeah, crazy sweet. Had my brother over when I cracked the bottle and he said the same. We both commented on how it would be best suited as a post holiday-dinner dram. Maybe some variation between bottles. Or maybe his palette is shot too as he’s the one I’m usually drinking with 😄
I did a review of this a couple of months ago.  Maybe there are variations, as others also mentioned an astringent taste. Oh and since you like the peat, Oogie for me has a sweetness to it, due to the sherry influence. If you ever get the chance, Glenfiddich 21 Gran Reserva is so sweet, it’s almost sickening. Ex rum cask."

I actually prefer the standard 10 despite being 40%. It was more of a sherry punch without the ethanol"

Finish: medium-length finish. Baking spices, pepper, and a drying, bitter oak. 

Final Thoughts:  Quintessential bourbon notes and flavors. If I wanted to experience what the average bourbon is like, this is a good place to start. It’s decent for a new distillery, but nothing I’d go out of my way to get. Bought a bottle, probably won’t finish it.

Review #54 - Glenfarclas 25 yr - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/edsf35pc4h6c1.jpeg,"Review #54 -Glenfarclas 25 Year - 43% ABV

Nose: dunnage & earth, slight mildew thing going on (maybe like a blue cheese), sherry, baking spices, cherry, slight oak. 

Palate: medium-thin mouthfeel. Dirt & earth right off the bat, followed by the sherry and some stone fruits. Old books/paper.  A drying, bitter oak on the mid plate. 

Finish: medium length finish. Dry oak tannins, hay, and a hint of pepper. 

Final Thoughts: I wanted to love this bottle, but didn’t. I gave it chance after chance to blow my socks off. It didn’t. The flavor profile is there, but the ABV and chill filtering absolutely cripple this.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s good, and the dunnage/old books/stone fruit combo is great. Many of the folks I shared this with (who are not big scotch drinkers) were blown away saying they never knew scotch could be this good. However, for me, I expected more from a 25 yr OB from farclas. 

Final Score: 80/100
This is one of my favorites, different palates.
I’m a big fan of Glenfarclas and have had just about every age they offer, but think it is one of the spirits that does best around the 15 year mark. Anything older than that has tended to be disappointing for me.
The family casks and some of the older IBs are completely different from the core range. Until about 2 years ago, you could still get a ~40 year, 70s vintage family cask for under 1000 USD and most of them were excellent. Maybe we'll see prices like that again in the future, if the current trends at auction continue. Some of the early 70s undisclosed speysides out there are some of my favorite whiskies. Especially the refill butts and fino casks. Those have gone up in price but they're still relatively reasonable compared to other bottles of similar age/distillation years.
This exactly why chill filtration and low ABV is such a bane for premium bottles.
Is the 25 chill-filtered? I thought only the 12 was. I'm reading conflicting reports online
I agree completely with the review. I too was disappointed with the thin mouth feel. What worries me is that I have a bottle of 30 and two 40 year plus a 1955 Family cask 58yr old. Although the last one is less likely to be drunk any time soon it has me worried about the taste of the others.
Had a bottle of 15 a couple of years ago and it was spectacular, by far one of my favourites. Still have two unopened that are hopefully just as good. 

Have been eyeing the 21 and 25 because of the affordable pricing and experience with the 15 but after your review I'm not too keen anymore.😅
The 25 used to be my go to Christmas whisky four years ago and earlier, but as it was running low I tried many other bottles which highlighted the Glenfarclas 25 as good, not great. I do still enjoy it, and the flavour profile I find goes very well with… writing, but I very much agree with your review.
So looks like im not the only one feeling dissapointed with Glenfarclas's 21 year old. Glad i bought mine for only $87 years ago
Great review first off! Now I have a problem with Glenfarclas, I love the family owned distillery, I love the ability to price well below most single malts, I love they have a massive age statement portfolio. But everything you have just described I said in a comment in a previous post about the most disappointing scotch I’ve had this year, it wasn’t the 25 but was the 21, the 21 under delivered in every way, the smell was muted, the taste was there but not extremely flavourful. It’s exactly as you put it, for an age statement whisky a certain quality is expected. And chill filtration or at the minimum heavy filtration, a low abv, which both 21/25 are, and what seems like tired poor old sherry casks well used and not imparting very much flavour hurts this brand and malt. I have an unopened bottle of 25 that I bought years ago for 250, and can still return it for the now increased price of 340 I believe. Genuinely curious if I should return this for something like a Kavalan Solist Vinho barrique, a Glenmorangie Signet( hey at least the signet is bottled at 46% and is said to have a range of 8-30 ish year old whiskies in it although who knows for sure) I’m less worried about something saying “25” and more worried about flavour and quality of casks and integrity bottling to a degree. Everything I’m reading is pointing me in the direction of returning that unopened bottle and exchanging it for something better.
Nice review and i basically agree. I think they are hiding the true gems outside the core range. To date, this is the only 25 year old spirit I’ve tried, but feels bland in comparison to many other whiskies half its age.

My favorite within them is still the 105, but the best I’ve tried is a warehouse select Taiwan exclusive. I’ve heard the family casks are fantastic but way overpriced.
Personally got to taste it in a 15/21/25 taster set, hoping to find a great example of a mature, non-sherry bomb dram… But all three were very disappointing. They do have hints of the greatness that could’ve been, but it just doesn’t attain it, regardless of adding water, letting it rest…

I have to admit it’s reassuring to see I’m not the only one. I would definitely try out a Family Cask if offered, or at a bar, but given their main offerings I’ll never take the risk on them blind.
I have to disagree entirely about the age. The older family casks and IBs tend to be exceptional. Have you had anything outside of their core range?
This is exactly why I generally stick to independent bottlers if I’m buying over 15ish years
Its a shame too. I believe this is one of the most affordable 25yo single malts around. I am glad I bought a tester first before I dropped the $180 or so on a bottle.
People assume everything under 46% is chill filtered.
I think they just barrier filter, but cant confirm that.
Wow. You can return bottles of whisky years latter for the current price? Is this Canada?
In the same boat, actually got it when it came back priced at 250. The very next day it shot up to 340. I was relieved i pulled the trigger when i did, but, like you, im wondering if the 340 can be put to something better. Yes, at the end of the day it's a 25 year old whisky but it doesnt mean anything if it doesnt deliver as other whiskies which may be younger and more complex - curious to knw where you stand
I think the best Glenfarclas stock is generally saved for the family casks nowadays. The core range is left to be affordable and accessible if a bit boring. I always thought it was a bit suspect that they had the cheapest 21yo and 25yo, I guess the lower quality may be why.
Agree. Most bigger age statement OB are either a rip off or watered down. There are a few exceptions like Arran 18 and Ledaig 18
For me, I’m less concerned with chill filtration or slight barrier filtrations than I am with old age stated whiskies being bottled at minimum or slightly above minimum strength, your taking such a delicate spirit that rested for 25 years uninterrupted and companies are deciding to sanitize and water down what could of been glorious spirit. Leave that to us, we can add small amounts of water ourselves, imagine the Glenfarclas 21/25 bottled at cask strength or at least 46-50%. I enjoy drinking whiskies at 40-43% sometimes but it depends on the bottle, a whisky that is 15 years or older should never be bottled under 46%. Your waiting 15-25 years just to stretch the spirit out and make more money, it isn’t about flavour profile, the companies want money and arnt afraid to kill the very whiskies that have made them famous. I’d rather a company who takes pride in their bottlings and stands by their spirit the way it comes out of the cask.
Yes, a part of Canada that has a government run organization which is the only store where you are allowed to buy spirits from. Since it is province wide and there is only 1 organization running things, the database they have for spirits is huge and generally they will accept something back so long as it isn’t open and still in the system ( meaning so long as they still buy and stock that product semi regularly)
Completely agree with everything you said. To me, the decision is now based off of the following, I own a 25 year old single malt which for me is the oldest I own, I’ll never buy it again at the current price nor will I be able to afford other brands in the 25 year plus region seeing as they have all fallen off cliffs of insanity and it’s just not my lifestyle to buy a bottle for 1000 ish dollars. So like you, I’m left wondering, is plugging the 340 it now goes for into something else worth it, and I have to say I’d be looking at other malts in and around 300-450 max because in not trying to make a 700 dollars bottle get cut in half bc the 340 is plenty enough already thank you very much, I’m not made of money lol. In the 3-450 range I’m looking online and the only things that catch my eye are Kavalan Solist Vinho Barrique, Glenmorangie Signet. Maybe the Auchentoshan 21 ( but that’s bottled at 43% too, only plus side is it’s 245 ish meaning we would still get another 100 ish of extra store credit to put towards something else). Maybe I’d do that auchentoshan plus a Glenallachie 15 that just got released again and over spend my budget by 50 ish bucks but be more happy ? Let me know what you think or if you’ve heard news about the stuff I’ve mentioned or if you’ve tried the stuff I’ve mentioned!? I’ve had Glenallachie 15 and think it is incredible. It smashed the Glenfarclas 21 in a side by side, that’s why farclas 25 is probably getting exchanged.
Just looked again, the only other two to intrigue me would be Craigallachie 17 for 200, and the Tamdhu 18.
Totally agree !
I agree it's surprising the 25 is only 43%, especially considering the 15 is 46%. I wonder if they're just trying to stretch it out to more bottles?
This is exactly it. They sell the label, not the liquid. Most consumers are honestly equally impressed by the label and taste while the group here is more heavily influenced by taste. We are not the target audience.
Lots of older cask strength glenfarclas are under 46%. The older ones vary pretty widely in abv. Some around 40 years are in the low 40s, while others, like the 40 year 105, are 60% or so.
CA 17 and Tamdhu 18 are both excellent choices.
Kavalan is good however I feel Ontario prices are bit higher than other places
I know Laphroaig Cairdeas 2023 will be dropping soon (reviews were mixed) 
Some stores still have the Family Casks but it can be a hit-or-miss
Signet is amazing but agian, better prices in other places 
Slim pickings really
All about the profit margins I think unfortunately
I completely see your point. But I would say to that, do you not think a natural cask strength Glenfarclas at its natural abv of 41-46ish max is still better than unnaturally watering it down for the sake of spreading the spirit longer thus bottling more from a single cask or a very few selected casks. I’m willing to bet that a “natural cask strength” tastes much more pure than a 25 year old bottled at 40/43% that if it wasn’t watered down, would probably range from 44-50. Just let it be whatever it is going to be. Companies need to stop having so many hands in their products, less is more. Don’t touch it, don’t do anything more to it other than blend and bottle, esp if it is an older malt
I'm fine with them watering down their boring core range when it means that their bottles that are targeted towards the serious enthusiast are relatively reasonably priced
Absolutely. A low abv cask strength whisky is very different from a 60% or more whisky that was watered down to 43%. The point I was trying to make is that it's really hard to guess how much it was watered down when we're talking about 25+ years in the cask.
I agree, but living where I do in Canada we just saw some family casks for the first time in Ontario for a while and they ranged from 380-750 dollars depending on age type etc. and that was for mostly 14 ish year malt. I don’t think that is reasonable. If I lived in a place that did sell it for a reasonable price I’m sure I would feel the exact same as you,  unfortunately whisky is too all over the place country by country. In one market something could be 100 USD and in another it could be 250 cdn. Even at conversion it doesn’t make sense. Id love to be able to try a good family cask from Glenfarclas though, seems like the best of the range
100%
That's rough. I live in North Carolina and we have a state owned liquor monopoly but we can still order stuff online and from auctions with relative ease. I haven't been in a state owned store for years. I've heard crazy stuff about pricing and lack of availability in some provinces of Canada.
When I refer to ""reasonably priced"" family casks, I got a 1973 cask #2599 for under 700 USD delivered to my front door a couple years ago. The sister cask, #2598 was about 800 shipped from Europe. Definitely not cheap but there weren't a lot of other bottles of that age and quality for less money.
Fine drams recently had a 26 year old family cask for 250 euro plus very reasonable shipping. Look them up.
To give you some idea of prices, Lagavulin 16 is 190 cdn, Glenmorangie 18 is 310, Glenmorangie Signet is 350, highland park 18 is 390, Oban 14 is 170, a simple Glendronach 12 is 110. It’s rough lol just went to a Notre Dame football game a few weeks ago and got markers cask strength for 42 American when in Canada it is 110.  And an Elijah Craig barrel proof for 79usd compared to 120 plus that it goes for in Canada
Wow I just checked out that Glenfarclas online, a 30+ year old malt for 700 seems very reasonable. I bet that would go for 2000 dollars here
I think the most recent one that sold at auction was around 1600 USD after auction fees and currency conversion. Auction prices are dropping for pretty much everything though."
Review #54 - Glenfarclas 25 year - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/ig4mwb6d3h6c1.jpeg,"The 25 is disappointing but the 21 is a better whiskey and much better value. The Family Casks can be wonderful.
Review #54 -Glenfarclas 25 Year - 43% ABV

Nose: dunnage & earth, slight mildew thing going on (maybe like a blue cheese), sherry, baking spices, cherry, slight oak. 

Palate: medium-thin mouthfeel. Dirt & earth right off the bat, followed by the sherry and some stone fruits. Old books/paper.  A drying, bitter oak on the mid plate. 

Finish: medium length finish. Dry oak tannins, hay, and a hint of pepper. 

Final Thoughts: I wanted to love this bottle, but didn’t. I gave it chance after chance to blow my socks off. It didn’t. The flavor profile is there, but the ABV and chill filtering absolutely cripple this.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s good, and the dunnage/old books/stone fruit combo is great. Many of the folks I shared this with (who are not big scotch drinkers) were blown away saying they never knew scotch could be this good. However, for me, I expected more from a 25 yr OB from farclas. 

Final Score: 80/100
I agree that the 21 is better than the 25. Given the prices of the Family Casks series I will likely never know how much better they are.
Iirc, I had the 21 on my bachelor party. Shit was *amazing*!
You wanted to love it….. so it gets 80%??
80% is not that high... I just gave my ardbeg 10 83% and that has to 4 times cheaper than this glenfarclas."

Similar, had a sample from an Advent Calendar (it was the last one to be opened, on 12/25), and I was excited to find it was a 25yo Scotch, but similar to the both of you…..it just didn’t deliver as you would have anticipated. Thanks for the review!
Thanks for the review. I’ve been on the fence with this one for a few years now. I think it’ll be a pass for now.
I have one of bottle opened of this, bought on sale for 160ish eur in 2021.. now it goes for 230+.

Can't say it has the best Q/P for a 25yo OB (as most OBs tbh, but I'm more of a single cask freak), but it's significantly both easy to drink and still deep, even with the murdering performed by reducing it at 43%.. and at the time it was far cheaper than most of any other 25yo OB (I saw the Glenlivet 25 at 225 already back then and not only the livet).. but then also Glenfarclas aligned the prices.

Would I buy it again at 160? Hmm maybe not. Absolutely not at the current price.   
  
But for what I paid it's still a 85/100 for me and I do not regret.. as it won't happen again for the foreseeable future xD
Costco had this in for under £100 a bottle last year, or may have been the year before. Saw it in another shop recently for £220! Definitely doesn't sound worth the money!
I had a 5cl sample of this and like you, I was completely let down. If I  had written a review at the time it would be almost word for word what you have here.
oh man, as a huge fan of the 10 and 12, are the older years disappointments? I bought my friend the 17 for his birthday and it was underwhelming, and it sounds like the 25 is underwhelming as well.
Word for word, eh?
 Dunnage, paper, blue cheese, old books, mildew? 😆
Maybe not the cheese part but the rest is pretty accurate lol. Their 21 was even more of a let down."

Thompson Bros put out some really outstanding bottles. If someone is brand new to exploring scotch independent bottlers (IBs) and does not know where to even begin what with all the unfamiliar brand names, Thompson Bros (PST on whiskybase) and North Star Spirits (NSS on whiskybase) are the two I would rec to start with, because they are (IMHO and to my taste) consistently good and consistently a reasonable value (or better) for the prices being asked.

Glad you enjoyed this one, cheers!

Love Caol Ila. Great review. Would something like this reach the US?
Oh my this sounds awesome. I love me some young high Proof caol ila. Thank you for the great review.
K and L may get picks of this. Royal mile whisky is doing free US shipping on 300 pounds ex vat which is about $420 US if you can stomach that. They probably don't have this bottle anymore but they may have things that are similar to it or other Thompson Bros. The free shipping deal is until the 28th of November.
They also offer 10% off if you sign up for their newsletter, which means you only need to spend GBP 270 / USD 340 for free shipping to the US.

I came very close to including this in my order:

https://www.royalmilewhiskies.com/caol-ila-2015-8-year-old-north-star-sherry-hogshead-56-7-70cl/

Works out at USD 57 for cask strength, sherry matured Caol Ila.
I missed the 10% off because I have an ad blocker. Dang.
Well, still a great deal with ex-VAT prices and no shipping or US sales tax. It's actually surprisingly hard to sign up for their newsletter. It's multiple steps, and when you think you're done, you're not.
I got 6 bottles for $420 that I can't even see in the US. Very excited for my rum and single malts to come. Grabbed a 7 year old Dailuane, 10 year Dominican, Campervan blended, and Worthy Park finished in a stout cask from Thompson. Stacked on a TDL Dram Mor and a Ledaig 18 as well. Completely worth it to me.
I just ordered that same Dailuaine, and the Campervan as well.  I'm really excited about the Dailuaine though,  as 2015 onwards Dailuaine is said to be very Waxy and Clynelish-esque. We'll see.
Nice! I was looking at that Campervan blend - very interesting casks. I got four full size bottles and four 200 ml bottles. The 200 ml bottles are reasonably priced, but the shipping for those is crazy so I'd never bought any before. Hard to find smaller bottles in the US.
I saw reviews on WB for it that led me to believe it was waxy Dailuane so I jumped on it. The Campervan was my 'fill the order to 300' bottle.
That's hilarious,  I didn't make it that high with my order to get the free shipping , but same concept. "" whats a cheap bottle I'll probably enjoy to spread the shipping costs to the US and make it more worth it to order"" From some research I've done,  I think the Campervan is really just Srv5 with a beer cask finish,  but I love srv so I'm cool with that.
Yeah I thought SRV5 was great. More fruit and malt on top would be icing on the cake.
Hey there,  did you taste the Campervan yet? It's wild,  like a straight up IPA. Bitter Hops and Malty roast. Like a 46% double IPA. It's interesting,  but not my favorite.  The dailuaine is wonderful though.
Yes. It was a WTF moment to me. The closest comparable is the Beer Eau de Vie from Nusbaumer (Espirit de Biere).

It had a ton more hops that I thought it would, and I honestly enjoy it. It bombs your palate though.

The Dailuane is gas. It's super waxy and rich fresh funky sherried. My order winner was the Dram Mor 13 year TDL Rum though. Absolute amazing balance of meatiness, spiciness, and fruitness from TDL distillate with a nice aging period.
Nice,  that sounds interesting.  I've got to try some rums, never really got too into them,  I gotta give it a shot.  Yeah that Dailuaine is for sure a nice bottle,  especially for the age."

HELP! Reeds too wide,"Hey Sax fam,
Need some input. I started playing again on an old mouthpiece that I haven’t touched for about 25 years or so. It’s an SRtech Fusion…think older Otto Links. Welp, all of the reeds that I can seem to find are too wide for the table and side rails. The reeds overhang just over 1/16” on each side of the mouthpiece and are absolutely destroying my lip because of it, making the mouthpiece chirp and squeak, and preventing my ligature (Rovner Dark) from really grabbing the reed. It’s driving me mad. 

1) Do you know of any narrower profile reeds that fit these older pieces?

2) What do you all recommend to use to shave the sides of the reed if there are no narrower profile reeds?",https://www.reddit.com/r/saxophone/comments/17o4cpg/help_reeds_too_wide/,"Hmm, I’m not sure that reed/mouthpiece table dimensions have changed so much over the years- is it possible that your mouthpiece’s table is defective? 

If it’s OttoLink-esque, and you’ve tried every “jazz” reed out there that doesn’t fit it well, I think you’re better off to cut your losses and find a new mouthpiece to love. I just don’t see how shaving such a substantial portion of the sides of the reeds won’t compromise the reed’s performance in some way. You’d have to sand the sides down, too, so you don’t scrape up your mouth. Plus, who has time for all of that?! 

You don’t mention which horn this is- but if it’s a tenor, maybe, just a maybe a bass clarinet reed could work and be slimmer? I’ve used those in a pinch- it wasn’t optimal in my situation, but I’m mostly a classical player. Maybe it could work with a soft bass clarinet reed and a jazz mouthpiece. Again, not likely to be optimal there, either. This is an interesting problem. Good luck!
I have no clue about a narrower reed selection for you to try to fix this (Sorry!!)  
In regards to filing it down, I'd first try this with a cheap or ""sacrificial"" reed before messing with one you care about. I'd then grab a small pencil file, one of those really small ones and do a few passes on one side of the reed, and then do the same number of passes on the other side. I always mess with my reeds under a direct light source (think hands directly under a lamp) which is a good rule of thumb when tinkering in general. Then I'd give it a try on your mouthpiece to see if you've done enough. If not, file it a bit more :)   
Hope this helps!!
The reed overhang is not uncommon and is not the cause of your problems. If it were, the Berg I’ve played for 50 years, much narrower than my reeds, wouldn’t work, nor would Plas Johnson of Pink Panther fame be able to play baritone reeds on tenor. So this is a non-issue. Look in the mirror or at mouthpiece damage to find the cause of your squeaks.
Comment #5 echoes your situation.
https://www.saxontheweb.net/threads/sr-technologies-pro-and-fusion.372038/
Oh, but also: a rovner dark ligature on a jazz mouthpiece? That may also be creating some difficulties with response.

I don’t know of a tool that will you slice so much cane at once- maybe turn to oboe or bassoon reed supplies? A cane splitter? The best idea I can come up with is one of those guillotine paper cutters with a swing arm- but that seems like an injury just waiting to happen.
Oh, I’m sure me as the player is part of the problem. But it’s because the overhang and sharp corners are causing pain in my lip that I’m forced to shuffle my embouchure around to make it comfortable enough to play, which I’m sure is exacerbating the issue.
Thanks for the link to that post. I knew I wasn’t the only one.
If it is physically hurting please stop using that mouthpiece. Assuming you do know how to play saxophone a fair bit go get another mouthpiece because it shouldn’t hurt. That’s why everyone recommends to try a mouthpiece out before buying(I know you aren’t buying in your case) but it’s important to see if it’s a good fit for you
In that case, you can cut the reed to fit, or get a different mouthpiece. I've successfully done both. Removing the sides of the reed has surprisingly little effect on the response. It's a pretty harmless fix. But do test on reeds you don't mind ruining until you get the hang of it. Due to the grain, you can start with a small nick and peel the edge right off. I'd start with just 1mm off each side. You can even chamfer the new edge with sandpaper.
If you search SRtech sax on the web, there are other posts. For the most part, ppl love them on alto and tenor. Check it out and connect with your SRtech tribe"

Great review! Really liked this one - regular PC10 is good, and this added an extra element of complexity, at least for us. Well worth it.
I love this one too. It's smooth, rich, so drinkable.
Love the 2013. Looking forward to picking up a 2014 whenever they hit shelves here.
Have you had the 2012? I’d love to do year comparisons since Bruichladdich is open on years and not making an effort for consistency but instead encouraging the variance
Praise you. I just drink
Enjoying a dram as I read this. Review was spot on. Thanks for posting this.
Nice review. I really enjoy this bottle. I find it refreshing, which is odd to say about a heavily peated Scotch. But the peat hits slightly differently for me than other Islay whiskies. I think I get a little bit of a mint note. I've heard they use mainland peat instead of Islay peat, but I don't know if that makes a difference."

Palate: medium-thin mouthfeel. Ethanol blast right up front. Red hot cinnamon candies, walnut shells, bitter oak, pepper, baking spices.

Review #49 - Old Forester 1920 Prohibition Style - 57.5% ABV

Nose: moss-covered bark, brown sugar, baking spices, cherry, pecan waffles, with just a hint of vanilla and nutmeg

Palate: medium-thin mouthfeel. Ethanol blast right up front. Red hot cinnamon candies, walnut shells, bitter oak, pepper, baking spices. 

Finish: medium-long finish. Bitter oak note remains prominent along with the spices. Lemon creeps in a little bit, ethanol tingle comes and goes.

I love the review and would never question someone's options and tasting notes.  But can I ask why a 72 that sounds like a high score for a bottle that sounds like you will not be replacing.
Nice review and thanks for the alternative take.
What do you prefer at that price point ? I love 1920, but wouldn't mind grabbing something new next
Thanks for the review! Glad I’m not the only one who thinks this whiskey isn’t some otherworldly thing

You're not alone. I also didn't care for this and was roasted by the bourbon community!
This isn’t for me either. Taste like pool water to me
I’m with you 100% on the bitter oak and ethanol blast. I traded a bottle of Bardstown Origin BiB for this because I absolutely love OF 1910. I was underwhelmed with the Bardstown and thought it was a no-lose trade. Well, I lost. I’m on my 5th bottle of 1910, this year, and still yet to get my 5th pour out of this bottle.
Because it’s still quality stuff. Just not to my personal tastes. 

72 is a C-  

It’s a passing grade but not a very good one.

Review #48 - Four Roses Small Batch Select - Bourbon,,https://i.redd.it/0sh46i2er6ib1.jpg,"Review #48 - Four Roses Small Batch Select - 52% ABV

Nose: fresh maple syrup, caramel apple, cherry, earth/dirt, honey, and a hint of baking spices. 

Palate: thin mouthfeel. Blast of ethanol right off the bat, cherry, peach, and other stone fruits, butter, bitter oak, brown sugar. 

Finish: medium long finish. Pepper and spice, burnt caramel, and a tingle from the ethanol. 

Final Thoughts: it’s a decent sipping bourbon. Was expecting much more from it though. It does a good job giving the classical bourbon notes, but for me, the mouthfeel is weak and it runs hotter than it should be at 52%. I use it to warm up my palate for better drinks. For that, it’s great. If you’re considering buying this, for what it’s worth, my recommendation is to get the normal small batch and save some money.

IMHO, 4Roses SiB is more desirable to me.  In addition, it is cheaper.  Sometimes I can get it for $36.
Your review is exactly where mine was. I tend to drink higher proof stuff but generally, that proof carries with it more complexity and flavor. In SBS, it's just ethanol - the flavors were lacking.

Great review! It provides a bit of validation that my palate wasn't too far off.
Great review, I just cracked my first bottle of this last night and thought the same. There's a lot of ethanol coming off of this and it really muted some.of the flavors for me. I had high hopes from this bottle but was a bit disappointed. But no doubt it's still a good sipper.
Agreed.  It's good, no question.  But I find the Four Roses SiB offerings are more interesting (and cheaper!).
I agree completely.  Drinks weirdly hotter than it should and is slightly bitter.  I was going on a family vacation and decided on two bourbons. I decided either Russell’s 10 or SiB and 4R SmB or SmB Select or SiB.  I first bought 4R SmB and RR SiB.  Then products went on sale and I swapped to RR 10 and 4R SmB Select.  This turned out to be a poor decision.  The RR 10 is too thin and the 4R was too hot to thoroughly enjoy. I enjoyed it at home, but not as much while if vacation.  I should have stuck to my original selections 🤣
Great review! We like that this one is not chill filtered and at higher strength - it definitely gives it a better, richer mouthfeel.
Good review. I agree with your assessment. I’ve learned from this sub how divisive this bottle is. I used to like SBS more than I do now but found that I prefer the fruitier Small Batch profile much more. Love the single barrels."
Help needed - Inside Corner Drywall with no stud,,https://i.redd.it/zhp3nwx2ushb1.jpg,"Take the piece and put a piece of wood behind it
Should never put a joint in line with the door frame. Always ideally one piece overtop or break the piece on a cripple above. Crack for sure.
Use a 1"" x 3"" behind the drywall

Take down the board, and the one next to it and re-measure so your board doesn’t end on the corner of a door or window.

How can I secure the top corner of this small doorframe drywall panel without having to add a stud behind it?  There is already intricate insulation and soundproofing behind it that we don’t want to dismantle.",https://i.redd.it/zhp3nwx2ushb1.jpg,"Add a stud. 

Yes, I read what you wrote.
Did you not look at the job before hanging it? This is like walk through 101. You need to have something to screw to there, you can’t just let it free float for that big of a span. Judging from what I can see in the picture you also have way too few screws in your board and it looks like there’s other places without studs.
A very common place for movement/cracking. The LHS piece should be in the shape of an inverted ‘L’  
, i.e go around the corner of the door, I think the minimum is around 200mm.

So if you cut the LHS piece again so it reaches halfway onto solid fixing above the window you will be golden. 

All pieces around doors and windows should be cut like this according to my countries drywall install guidelines, I would strongly recommend reading yours, as it looks like your screws are few and far between. They will pop and affect the finish.
Take the drywall off and jam a block in there.
So it’s your first day hanging drywall, I see.
Screw a piece of wood to the piece next to it so it’s sturdy and overhanging the open part. Then use that as the stud
I’d really like to see the “intricate” soundproofing and insulation above this door.
Either add a stud or you might get away with drywall repair clips.

take it back off and add an effing block.
Savvy?
Seconded.

Yes, I also read what OP wrote.
When patching I use a 1 by to keep the patch piece level with the existing. You could do the same here. Add a 1x2 to the left panel by screwing it and then screw the board on top of the door to it. Not the best fix but next best to adding a stud."
Review #47 - Macallan 12 Year Sherry Oak - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/tr8gy3zyq4gb1.jpg,"As someone who is new to Scorch, I really enjoyed it.  One of my favorites as it’s not overly Smokey or peaty.  🤷🏼‍♂️
Review #47 -Macallan 12 Year Sherry Oak 43% ABV

Palate: thin mouthfeel. Oak upfront with baking spices. Old wood pulp (which many refer to as pencil shavings). Followed by those dark fruits and a blast of thinned out sherry. 

Finish: medium length finish. Ethanol finally starts to show a little, a drying, bitter oak stays on the palate with the dark fruits.

It’s alright, fine oak 10 and livet 15 are better.
Your final thoughts don't sound like a 68? A whisky below 70 is bad - it's drinkable starts above 70. You shouldn't consider the price in your score. The price/score is the PV which is important.
68 is still a passing grade where I’m from. It didn’t fail, and was beyond drinkable. Something not drinkable would be <50"
Review #47 - Macallan 12 Year Sherry Oak - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/tr8gy3zyq4gb1.jpg,"Fair and nicely done review, although I do wonder how a 68 on your personal scale compares to some other common bottlings, to help give us more perspective.

In any event, despite all the hate for the brand, Macallan 12 Sherry Oak was one of the better entry-level sherried scotches well into the late 2010's.  But these recent 2020's bottlings have taken a noticeable step back and are no longer something I'd recommend (although to be fair, most sherried scotches are not worth the money anymore).

Macallan really has downgraded since around 2018 or so, when their prices started climbing as fast as inflation did. Regardless,  I occasionally see bottles on sale for $60 at some local stores which tempts me to pick one up from time to time!
What would you recommend as an alternative? Macallan 12 has been my go to?
Excellent review. I think Macallan created the hype. That the more a Scotch costs the better it is. What a magnificent LIE!!! But their scotch always costs the most so it Must be the Best.... even at 43% ABV and chillfiltered. So sad. I know about the NAS Cask Strength releases etc. But I'll never give a cent to Macallan. 

We constantly have newbies come on this subreddit saying they want something really good for this and that occasion or friend and then say I've only got $200-$400 max budget.... thanks Macallan the LIE lives on. Bunnahabiann 12 is under $75 or Laphroaig Cairdeas is under $100. Port Charlotte 10 or Deanston 12 and the list goes on. Peat or no peat.

Excellent bottles.... never Macallan.

Just saying.
More like since 2010
> climbing as fast as inflation did.

Faster than inflation. Way faster. And don't expect the trend to stop. COVID turned a bunch of people into the spirits hobby, with scotch and gin being toward the top of that increased demand

It's one of the reasons I decided to invest in Diageo. With their portfolio that stock cannot go anywhere but up.
Good question, since sherried scotch across the board has really declined over the last few years, meanwhile prices just keep going up, which means there aren't many standouts (this stands in stark contrast with younger, heavily-peated scotch, for which we are currently in something of a golden age).  I've reviewed several entry/intermediate sherried scotches over the last year or so, and none of them have really impressed me that much in terms of quality and/or value.  

If you still like Macallan 12 Sherry Oak, you should just stick with it.  But Macallan 12 is priced so high that it wouldn't be much of a jump in cost to go to another distillery's 15-year-old, e.g., GlenAllachie 15, Tamdhu 15, or GlenDronach 15, and even though I don't *love* those bottlings, I have found them to be a slight cut above where Macallan 12 Sherry Oak seems to be these days.
If you enjoy sherried scorches I would recommend Aberlour A'bunadh. It is certainly a sherry bomb, but so delicious for less money.
Honestly, I personally find Bunnahabhein 12 way better for way less money. Would recommend the Cask Strength or even the regular 46%.
But for more money, close to the Macallan price, GlenAllachie 15 is Amazing!! Way way better. People say Glendronach 15 is also great, but I haven't tried it yet; didn't like the 12yo very much tho.
The bourbon hype in the states are crazy too, especially with anything slapped with an age statement or ""bottled in bond"" going off the shelves all the time!
I agree with you in that GlenDronach 12 is definitely not worth the price these days; you have to go straight to the 15 if you want something decent from their range.

When I first tasted it I felt like the flavor was subdued but going back to it the 12-year Cask strength is really good heard they are going to discontinue the Cask strength 😢 we have one unopened bottle left
Internet folks have talked about the CS losing its age statement or disappearing altogether before. I was even scared into buying a few extra bottles a year or two ago, just in case. They were only $75 apiece, so I can't complain. Unless you heard this through official channels, I wouldn't heed it.
Agreed. I’ve heard the rumors multiple times from multiple people, so I emailed Redbreast last year and they said they didn’t have plans to discontinue it. That said, I still buy it whenever I can find it- it’s my absolute favorite Irish whiskey."

Interesting review. I get the same type of bitterness from woodford double oaked after it’s been opened for a little while that makes me not want to drink it. It’s great initially but then quickly develops a weird bitter finish.
I am still yet to have this bottle click for me. I always stock the standard 12 expression and drink plenty of high proof and cask strength drams but this always fell flat in terms of $ spent between it and the 12 and my enjoyment of both. I know I’m in the minority by not having a rave review of this one.
Both Cask Strength and standard 12 was 99 $CAN when I got it."

Their standard cask strength release should be closer to what you're looking for I think. It's complex, bold and full flavored stuff.
How convenient that there‘s a batch strength version of the 10y being offered :D
What does everyone think of the script on the bottle? I know it’s a silly thing, but I always felt it looked a bit like childs’ script and so created a negative bias.
>I’d love to try a cask strength, NCF, IB version of this.

Benromach puts these out several times annually. There’s some batch variance of course. The latest 2012 b#2 is pretty much a cs 10yr. They’re also owned by an IB.
I don’t really like their old branding (as seen in this picture) or the new branding either. Looks too much like Smirnoff to me…
Yea, I know they do their own thing. I meant I want to try an actual independent bottling version of this, as IBs can sometimes show what different cask management strategies will do to a distillate style. I want to compare and contrast.
Will never happen. They haven’t released an IB since an IB purchased Benromach lol. Try another scotch 😎

Review #44 - Glen Scotia 15 year - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/b55xso3ygc1b1.jpg,"Review #44 - Glen Scotia 15 Year - 46% ABV

Nose: bitter oak, dunnage, molasses, caramel, earth/dirt, dark raisins, light baking spices, dark red fruits, and a hint of brine

Palate: medium-thin mouthfeel. Bitter oak, baking spices, and a hint of plums and industrial oil

Finish: medium-long finish. Bitter oak remains. Slightly drying and tannic. Straw, white pepper, and a very small caramelized berries note. 

Final Thoughts: I’ve heard some great things about the Glen Scotia 15, so I came into this with some expectations, albeit not big ones. However, they did not live up to the expectations for me.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s a decent whisky, but it was a bit more one note than I was expecting. The bitter, tannic oak really was the shining star, and I generally don’t prefer that in a scotch. I wanted more of the dunnage, funk, and industrial oil, or even more of the fruits.   For 46% and NCF, the mouthfeel was also weaker than I anticipated. 

Overall, I’m happy to have tried it, but wouldn’t buy another bottle.

Personally I think the cheaper double cask is better
I will I agree with you! I was expecting it much better from what I've heard. Maybe different batches (?)
Some say leave it in the glass with a touch of water for an hour...
Just had a glass of this earlier. I think it gets better over time in the glass and bottle. It hasn't hit hard for me yet like some claim it to do.

I really appreciate the sweet and sour malted barley I get along with the herbaceous finish. I'd throw it at 85 or an 86 on the standard scale based on what I've had. It's good, but definitely not worth chasing like some are. It's like an over-oaked partially depressed Springbank 10.
I'll probably get flamed for saying this, but I personally preferred the 15 yo over the Victoriana when I tasted them. It just goes to show how individual our palettes and preferences are when it comes to whisky.
thats not really a comparison, seen as that is sherried. But the best one imo is the victoriana
I tried several and liked the weirdness of the dbl cask.
Always a good point - often a bottle needs time.  That's why I'm skeptical of reviews off of a mini.  Besides, we purchase a whole bottle - when we do - and it's the journey through the bottle that matters, not just one dram here or there.
I absolutely love Glen Scotia and the Victoriana is sharing the top of my all time favorites list. However, I have found the batch variations at my beloved distillery can be..... phenomenal and disappointing.

So, depending on which 15yr and which Victoriana you were sipping side by side it could happen.

I had a bottle of Victoriana that I blended with my 15yr and eventually poured out just not the Glen Scotia I loved.... really.  But I found batches of Victoriana that were absolutely sublime! I have a few bottles in reserve of those batches.

Currently I have 4 Cask Strength releases from Glen Scotia which are amazing. So, when they get it right I think no one does it better just different. When they go off the rails.... it's a train wreck. I have had a couple of derailments and some really nice whisky and then there's the amazing dram that gets named the best single malts in the world.

Just saying.
Its definitely a comparison. Both from the same distillery and in the same price range. Just because on has a slightly different finish doesn’t mean you can’t compare them. 

By the way the 15 is finished in Sherry casks.
I hesitated trying the Vic after my hard time finishing the 15. Man is it good stuff but the price has spiked .
nothing directed at the OP of course.
don't waste first half the bottle like that  


if needs time, take the time with poured whisky until it's drinkable 

we don't have to wait the bottle get better. I din't know why people do that stuff
Cheers for the info. I didn't realise there was that much batch variation with Glen Scotia.
Where do you live? either the 15 is really really cheap then or the double cask way overpriced.

&#x200B;

the 15 in the netherlands is almost 2,5times the price of the double cask.
what do you mean?  I’m really not sure I understand your response or what you think you are responding to.
Sad to say, I love them but I've experienced it a couple of times. 

So, I think it was in one of Ralfy's latest vlogs, #976 I think, he was raving about the signature spirit when he was reviewing the Double Cask Rum release, which he wasn't too impressed with.  

So, I love the best things they do and when I find them I tend to buy extra.

Just saying
In Texas. The 15 is $75 and the DC is $55
i mean bottle doesn't need time to get good. Some people just drink first half complaining that it's not that good until turns good... it's a waste of scotch

&#x200B;

Instead of waiting the ""good half bottle"" make the first half a good experience resting in a glass for 30min or an hour. People doen't need to wait months to fully enjoy the sweet spot
Damn. thats very expensive for the double cask.

Here the 15 is about 75euros. and the DC 35ish and i kind of find that expensive for a NAS. for the same money i have a bunna 12.

Altough i love everything by glen scotia apart from the harbour. found that flavourless
resting surely makes sense. My point is simply that one’s palate and many other conditions continually change - even the hooch to some extent- so there’s so much more to the experience than a single tasting
I have experienced huge markups for Scotch in the last year. Its pretty much the norm now. There are a few hidden gems like Bunna 12 that still goes for $50. Almost everything has gone up 20-50% in price in the last 1-2 years
Yeah its terrible. a year ago i bought glenscotia 15 for 40euros now its mostly 75. terrible.

Now i just wait for good discounts and then stock up
I just checked and now the 15 is $85. The DC is still $55. After tax the 15 is $92. Prices are insane
Wow, that is terrible. and not worth it at all. Just bought benromach 2012 cask strenght batch 3 for 60 bucks. Thats good value compared to this.

And absolutely delicious
The 15 is $90 here, and I was considering it..."
Review #44 - Glen Scotia 15 year - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/m9jc87zmgc1b1.jpg,"Review #44 - Glen Scotia 15 Year - 46% ABV

Nose: bitter oak, dunnage, molasses, caramel, earth/dirt, dark raisins, light baking spices, dark red fruits, and a hint of brine

Palate: medium-thin mouthfeel. Bitter oak, baking spices, and a hint of plums and industrial oil

Finish: medium-long finish. Bitter oak remains. Slightly drying and tannic. Straw, white pepper, and a very small caramelized berries note. 

Final Thoughts: I’ve heard some great things about the Glen Scotia 15, so I came into this with some expectations, albeit not big ones. However, they did not live up to the expectations for me.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s a decent whisky, but it was a bit more one note than I was expecting. The bitter, tannic oak really was the shining star, and I generally don’t prefer that in a scotch. I wanted more of the dunnage, funk, and industrial oil, or even more of the fruits.   For 46% and NCF, the mouthfeel was also weaker than I anticipated. 

Overall, I’m happy to have tried it, but wouldn’t buy another bottle. 

Final Score: 70/100
That’s so much not my experience of Glen Scotia anything. It’s got old books, Campbeltown funk and graham crackers for me and I honestly love it. But each to their own. Cheers.
Sounds gross. 

Idk how everyone loves scotch so much more than Irish whiskey. Not Jameson either. 

Redbreast 15 goes down like sweet tea. Delicious.
Probably the same reason some people like marmite and don't feel the need to put chocolate spread on their toast every day?
wtf is a marmite? like a small mammal?
Try putting some bitter oak, straw, dirt, and brine on your sandwich...

Oh no. 

That's a shame. Likewise, I'd heard lots of good things. Rather than spring for a whole bottle o bought samples though. Hopefully I get something from it that you don't. 

I would really like to try the 10yo Teavel Exclusive - I'm pretty sure it's a cask strength so might carry a more varied profile. 

Thanks for sharing.
I was similarly disappointed (I'd have given it 83 on initial taste) but found that it improved in the final third and the last 2 inches or so are a LOT better - so much so that I will probably get another - but one with the livery of your bottle, not the newest labellings. I'm not saying it will reach 90/100 but I think you'll find your score rising. (It has been sitting in my stash for about 18 months and I sampled it sporadically and intermittently over that period)."
Review #43 - Blanton’s Single Barrel - Bourbon,,https://i.redd.it/skivs45qeiya1.jpg,"Review #43 - Blanton’s Single Barrel - 46% ABV

Finish:  medium  length finish, tannic oak, slightly bitter, with baking spices

Final Thoughts: Decent run of the mill bourbon. Not going to blow your socks off, but not going totally let you down either. Definitely not worth the hype and secondary prices.  Solid daily sipper, and would probably be great as a mixer. I’m sure there are some great casks of this, but the one I had kind of put me off. Doubt I would get the bottle, even at retail prices. 

Final Score: 68/100
Grumble grumble grumble… I’m here to make some obnoxious snarky comment about how Blanton’s is overhyped, just a pretty bottle, and or these X bourbons are better/cheaper/whatever…

We all get it, you’re bothered by the Blanton Taters, but at this point I’ll take a Blanton Tater over a Blanton Hater any day. I’d much rather be around someone excited about a bottle than someone shitting on it because others “like it too much.”

Is Blanton’s my favorite nope, but do I enjoy it? Yup.

We ALL have bottles we idealize that would lose in blinds to other stuff. You’re upset Buffalo Trace marketed Blanton’s “too much” with the bottle presentation? Take a look around your home, you’ve been sold things that were over marketed as well. This isn’t new and certainly not indicative to whiskey.

Drink the whiskey you like the way you like it and respect others ability to do so too, even if that means they only drink Blanton’s.
Why anyone should have to be so creative with such eye catching design (the bottle) when the the real product needs to be the one that hits the flavor off the ballpark.
I have one unopened bottle of Blantons, because it has a dump date that is special to me.  I’m not a big fan of Blantons. It’s not bad, but it’s not great either
I have not had any Blantons in YEAR and would love to get my hands on a bottle but the fact is I am not going to pay the 140 a store near me is trying to sell it for! I would pay an extra 20 to 30 bucks for it! I know it's not worth it but I have not had any in so long and would love to have one. I guess I'll just have to keep searching and maybe even take a trip to the distillery to possibly get one!
Super over hyped. There are at least 5 $30 sippers always available that I would rate higher
I put Blanton's, same proof, in a 15-person blind tasting of 20 whiskies.  It finished dead last.  Edit .  Bottles were all broken down into 50 ml samples.  Participants turned in scores of 3 samples per week until completed.  Tasted blind, results revealed after completion.
Are the Kentucky derby bottles better to save or to drink?
You know what’s bette than Blanton’s? A Blanton’s tasting with Red, black, gold (Japan version) and straight from the barrel. I have a few bottles of each after living in Japan for a bit. Also was your review right after opening or opening to try letting the bottle sit and then going back to it?
derivative review #5237
When i came on board collecting and i live on the trail. Lou ky. All i heard blantons this that other. Despite its ok. There is a lot better. Michers fort nelson byo weller 12 but blantons ia 65.00 bourbon dont overpay
I dont think OP was stating that at all. It’s not unknown that most of what Buffalo Trace puts out is “run of the mill”. That’s not to say it’s bad by any means, in fact most people do enjoy all of their products. That being said, there are incredibly few of their products that are worth anything over msrp from a value perspective. I think you looked too far into this post because OP was not a Blantons Hater by any means.
True this. Blantons is very solid for MSRP. Ill buy it all day for less than $70 ... for $200? Nah
Apparently it’s a rite of passage to write a Blantons review to let everyone know you think it’s an average bourbon and it’s overhyped.
Haha, this guy here.
Name them. This isn't baiting, I am looking to expand my liquor cabinet and would love recs.
Everybody’s judgement is usually pretty good after 20 glasses of bourbon
Why the hell would you blind 20 whiskies? They’ll all end up tasting the same.
We just did a blind tasting. 30 guys that night. Blanton’s was the lowest ranking one.
Ok but what other whiskeys did you put it up against.
Do you want to just stare at a bottle on a shelf with a special sticker? Drink it! You’ll enjoy it a lot more.
 Bourbon is for drinking
The comment wasn’t directed at OP at all in any way.

It was directed at all the commenters that are filling this thread up with the same old generic “Blantons Hate Take” they always do whenever the bottle is mentioned.

It’s boring and it’s beating a dead horse at this point. We get it. You hate it because Buffalo Trace succeeded in marketing a product to people that don’t know as much about whiskey as you or “insert whatever recycled take makes you feel better them.” 

If you’re in the crowd that is pissed because you really like Blanton’s but the Taters have drove the price up in your area due to not being in a controlled state, I’m sorry, that does actually suck, but Blanton’s is far from the only whiskey that this has/is happening too.
I’m waiting for some ballsy SOB to write up a “Blanton’s? 10/10, pew-pew pew-pew-pew, air horn! air horn! GOAT!!!!!!!!!” review.
They are probably going to say stuff like WT101 and EW BiB. While taste is subjective…. That ain’t it.
Four Roses Small Batch, Old Gran Dad 114, Makers 46, Elijah Craig, Buffalo trace (lesser availability but definitely around my area if you hour on hound somewhere like a total wine)
Coopers Craft 100 proof, Elijah Craig, Early Times, 1792 sb, Evan Williams bib.
The first time I had Blanton's I also had Michter's bourbon. To me they tasted so similar that in a blind they probably would have been hard to say which was which. Both were pleasant easy sipping bourbons.
3 samples per week were scored.
3 samples per week were scored. I've ran several of these and know how to do it.  Why did you assume it was 20 at one time?

I've posted all the results from all the blinds I have ran on my blog, tater-talk.com.  this one included whiskies such as EC Toasted, Uncle nearest, Garrison brothers, HH 7 year Bib
I mean, i wish buf trace had succeded by raising the price a bit. Seems like instead they use scarcity to push low level stuff and pretend its good for the msrp.


Anyways, its fine and their choice clearly works. I think lots of the anger is wanting a bottle for a while, and when you see it its a fucking eagle rare for $99 (happened to me) and maybe a blantons for $250.


Which... you either cave and feel stupid when it only hits for what it should cost, or you dont buy it, smartly, and another day of wondering and just wanting to try it.


Tbh i dont blame them at all, just bottle flippers. Its endemic now, in any hobby. Gf wanted an embroidered pokemon squishmallow, just a fukin pillow, and all the ones on sale are just career-flippers who just follow hype and scalp people that want things. Same with sneakers, etc etc. Frustrating, but not Blantons fault.

Ps, we all want pretty bottles if theyre gonna be on the display for a year.


Rant end.
Tune in next time for another installment of the BT hit-job series, where we'll rate Rock Hill Farms a 5 and pat each other on the back.
Actually no… I wasn’t
I prefer FR yellow to the SmB. OGD114 is nice. Buffalo Trace is gonna be the best $30 bottle you can get. M46 is decent. Haven’t had base EC in a long time. 

These are good budget recs. But I wouldn’t pick them over Blanton’s.
Thanks! I do actually have all these except Elijah Craig. There seem to be so many on the shelf already, then my local stores love to do barrel picks with EC, and I'm overwhelmed with options. Literally have a local store that has done four in the last two years, which I imagine all taste good, and all of which are on the shelf, but are $75 plus our redic liquor taxes here in WA.  

I don't know how to get into it because I don't mind spending a few dollars on a bottle, but I'm not sure what the base Elijah Craig really should taste like.
Hey, you have five I've never tried. Sell me on 1792. I left a 1792 BiB store pick on the shelf because I was worried it would be a waste. Should I go get it?
Seems logical to assume it was a 7 week long blind testing…
I've never seen someone run a blind tasting over 2 months
What are your recs
To each their own, Blanton’s - for my palate - is a bit watery
Sure. I haven’t had their bib. The 1792 is one vertical I would love to have all of. Their small batch is phenomenal for the price. It drinks like a $70 bottle but only runs $30. Outstanding daily.
Well I have run 5 of them and been a participant in 5 plus more.
I’ve asked the exact same question to which I received this list of those “better” than Blanton: Old Forrester 1910,
Four Roses Small Batch Select,
Sagamore Rye Double Oakes,
EHT SiB,
Barton (Original Bottles - Two Types),
Frey Ranch,
Calumet 16,
ECBP C922.

I also got an alleged list of ten that were blind tested where Blanton hit dead last, sharing that spot with Benchmark Top Floor.

I guess it’s just so cool to hate it now, because that’s what the cool kids do. I for one have placed it at the top of my list, which includes, RR10, several barrels of the ECBPs, John J. Bowman, among others.
See above, I listed a few low cost bourbons always available that are on par
well super duper
In your opinion. Whiskey is subjective. Give 20 people your recs with Blanton’s blind and a guarantee they don’t all agree on the order. Blanton’s may even win for some people."

Nose: pineapple juice, vanilla, coconut sunscreen, sea brine/saltwater, lemon & a hint of banana, grass & hay, barley sugar, yeast

Palate: medium mouthfeel. Lemon and hay. Sweet & sour, pineapple, sea salt, pepper, ethanol. 

Finish: medium finish. Pepper, ethanol, underripe lemon zest. Now you get a blast of oak flavor that quickly turns slightly tannic and bitter and the end. 

Final Thoughts: In my humble opinion, Arran 10 is really what beginners to scotch should start with. Skip Glenfiddich, Glenlivet, Macallan, and the blends such as Johnnie or Balentines. Go straight to Arran. The Arran 10 is a fantastic, high-quality, budget friendly single malt with a great presentation. It’s flavor profile is unobtrusive and fairly basic, but it does it amazingly.  The bottle ran me £40/$50, and for that price, it is a super value. The label even has braille. Just top notch Arran, really top notch and well thought out for this price point. 

For those that are more experienced, it’s got some great tropical flavors with a malty backdrop, but the ethanol could be integrated a little better and it does run a little hot for 46%. It’s what I’d have around to get my friends into scotch who initially try to tell me “I dont like scotch”. 

Final Score: 85/100
I had bought a bottle for the sake of buying an inexpensive bottle. Not until halfway through the bottle I realized, “oh shit, this is pretty good”. Ever since then, I try to always have a bottle on hand. It’s a good reminder that you don’t have to spend half your paycheque to get a good bottle nor does it need to be an old age statement. Sure, it is young tasting, but that’s not always a bad thing. Arran proves that.
Great review, I totally agree that it’s the platonically perfect entry to scotch.
Weird but cool backsplash. Different and I like it
Nice review but i disagree.

I think you need to start with glenfiddich/glenlivet etc. 

This is a complex malt disguised as an easy entry malt. Its very good but a new or young palate will absolutely not appreciate this in my opinion
I can’t find this locally but I bought a bottle when I was in Scotland for £34 and really enjoyed it, and I also agree with a lot of your notes.
I feel that way about benriach 10,which I tried a mini of recently. At first I though 'this isn't bad', but by the end I was impressed with the subtle nuance and depth, with no real flaws at all.
Agree 100%

Now I never recommend the weak watery stuff like Glenfiddich 12 to beginners. Why start them on something that lacks flavor and mouth feel?
Arran, Arran so far away.... To get a bottle, this sounds very interesting!
I love this whisky. It's a tropical fruit punch in the mouth.
This is one of my favorite scotches for the year.!!
Sweet fruity and delicious
What year is this bottling? Mine looks much darker...
Been wanting to try this one.
This has become my new sipping scotch. The value it brings is way beyond its price point.
I am just in love with Arran 10. The citrus notes, the fruity nose and the palate. Would you help me to find something at least similar to it???

Great review! Agree with a lot of your tasting notes.

We were a little late to the game with this one, a ways behind the hype train, and only tried it a month or two ago, but it’s amazing value for the quality. Delicious stuff, and agreed, this is a great place to start as opposed to JW, Glenfiddich, Glenlivet, etc.
I want to ask then. I bought a bottle of this and love it. But I see some many folks characterize this scotch and other like it as “beginners scotch”. My question is, what speyside, non peated, traditional scotch flavors whiskeys have this flavor profiles similar but are not considered beginners scotch? 

It’s seems to me anything like this is always called that. I ask because I’d love to try to hunt down some more complex bottles. I have been a long time bourbon drinker but only about a year into scotch and really love how flavorful, yet unchallenging these profiles can be. Any suggestions? It seems to be for anything to not be “beginner” it just needs to be finished in some manner or peated.
Sunscreen 100% been looking for a description for that smell for a while
I disagree with your disagreement. 

I have served this to several friends who describe themselves as absolute beginners/noobs (people who only drink whisky once every 2-3 years and don't purchase or order at bars). Every one of them has liked Arran 10, mainly because of the non-offending fruity flavours and no smoke.

Would they have liked Glenlivet/Glenfiddich 12 better? I doubt it.
2020
I like bottom up approach: that glenlivet makes me appreciate things like Arran even more.
I do not believe that Arran 10 is a beginners scotch. There is superb quality and depth to it. What I’m saying is that the flavor profile of Arran 10 doesn’t have certain notes that many new to scotch may not appreciate. Such as barnyard, dunnage, peat, earth, dirt, anise, mushroom, diesel/engine oil, minerals, etc. 

Instead, it has flavors and notes that many new to scotch are often more familiar with and may have experience with from other spirits. Notes such as fruits, salt, sweet & sour, or malt (often find in high-barley mashbills).
I disagree with your disagreement on my disagreement. 
I think palate has to get used to it and then evolve in higher abv even. But there are always exceptions
Yep, definitely a fair point. With limited time, money, and liver ability, we’re just a little more picky with what we choose now, haha
I disagree with your disagreement with his disagreement of your disagreement!  Especially because there's a lot of people out there looking for premium spirits who have experience with other spirits. In my case, American whiskey, which by comparison, has lots of cask strength options available in the USA and makes entry-level low abv malts look dull.
I disagree with your disagreement of my disagreement of his disagreement with my disagreement!

In that case yes. But then its not an inexperienced or new palate. Only to scotch.
Im talking more about people who arent familiar with spirits at all. 
Then low abv “dull” would be better to get into it imo.
For seasoned bourbon/rum/mezcall drinkers then id say go for it yes. Even the occasionall drinker.

But the newbies i would advice go with the dull 40% first
Bourbon is a poor man’s Scotch. LOL"

Palate: medium-thin mouthfeel. Slightly tannic oak followed by a blast of overripe apples. Pear, hay/straw, earth, raw brown mushroom, brown sugar and toffee candies, pepper, light baking spice. 

Finish: tannic oak remains, with baking spices, overcooked pastry dough, and a flash or two of that apple. 

Final Thoughts:  a good Calvados. For me, the nose is far more interesting than the palate. The nose picks up those super funky, aged elements that the palate totally misses here.

The palate hangs on to the tannic oak and baking spices a little too much for my preference. However, it’s a great brandy overall.

I really liked the bottle I had of this, but it was certainly a first fill Sherry (color was super dark), and the ones I have tried since have been lighter in color and just not as good.  Very unpredictable bottle, but if you see a particularly dark one jump at it."

Nose: lemon, grape candy, sourdough, floral bouquet, maple syrup pancakes, with faint notes of dunnage, earth, and old books

Palate: burnt grape coated in carmelized brown sugar, sweet & sour, baking spices, pepper, slightly bitter and drying oak. Medium mouthfeel. 

Finish: medium-long finish. baking spices, brown sugar, bitter oak, red orchard fruits. 

Final Thoughts:  I bought this bottle with low expectations and was very pleasantly surprised. This was a fantastic single sherry cask expression from Balvenie. The flavor evolves over your palate and you get different punches throughout the ride. First punch is oak and spices, followed by fruits and flowers, then earth and dunnage, then wraps up with a tingly return to the oak and spice.

Balvenie 14 Caribbean Cask is surprisingly good.
Balvenie is over priced for what it is. Having said that, I haven’t tried this expression yet.
That’s a nice color. Are these natural color and non-chill filtered?
I have 2 for sale. It is sold out and discontinued in florida
[removed]
I’ll say this is my favorite Balvenie I’ve had by a wide margin. Quality varies by batch, but at worst it’s slightly overpriced and at best it’s one of the best sherry expressions I can find.
Yes
A single cask and a vatting do not exactly make a fair comparison.
Won’t even bring up PA! NJ is the only way to go. 👍
Nothing but facts!!!!
I kinda agree with your point but of the two bottles, the tastier one imo is the glendro.
If anything it is cheap for an OB sherry single cask at 15yo. Equivalent OB single cask from Glendronach would probably be closer to $200 at least.
I was looking at the cost base of a single cask -- there are tangible (scarcity, opportunity cost etc) and intangible (prestige etc) reasons why it costs more per bottle for a single cask. And what you get is the potential for an extremely good or extremely bad bottle, with no room to try and balance things out with blending and vatting.

I'd love to try earlier Balvenie Single Barrels; the early 90s distillate in IBs I've tried have gorgeous herbal-floral notes of honeysuckle and chrysanthemum."

Finish: medium-long finish. Mineral-rich seashells, vanilla, baking spices, burnt match, red grapes.

Nice review! I’m still learning more about the different scotches and the regions where they’re made. Are Islays typically more peaty/more earthy?
Islay is basically where most peated scotch comes from.

Bruichladdich and Bunnahabhain are the only two on the island that make primarily unpeated scotch. But both of them make peated scotches under different names.

Caol Ila is an Islay that mostly makes peated scotch but they have an unpeated 15 year old.
Thanks for the info!"
Review #38 - Ardbeg Uigeadail - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/g3wkk6x7cpka1.jpg,"Interesting take, especially about it feeling thinner than the Ten.  I’d take Uigeadail 10/10 times over the Ten, which to me tastes pretty one note.
I feel like it became thinner then before, i guess that there is a bit more younger spirits now then it used to be.
Nowadays i prefer kilchoman sanaig over oogie

One of the most iconic drams ever made imo. 

Encapsulates everything Ardbeg and Islay is about.
My second love and stole me away from Lag 16.  Then along came Corry and I forgot the others until I met Hypernova.  We've been together ever since.  Although she does not know about my relationship with Octomore.  Yet.
Has anyone had the hypernova to compare to?
Needs a decent amount of water for me to really enjoy it, like 6+ drops.
I did a blind tasting of oogie from 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020 and 2021
Not surprising the 2020 was last place. To the point it didn't even taste like the same distillate.
2015 and 2017 were neck and neck for the top and 2021 was a slight improvement on 2020
Legend of a whisky. One of the best I've ever had
Completely with you. I prefer Loch Gorm to Lagavulin 16 too. I think kilchoman is amazing, I prefer Machir Bay to Longrow NAS too ( find them quite similar in profile)
[removed]
Well ten is certainly a nice solid mouthfeel, I never saw ugi as thin.
Corry?
Yeah, I compared the two, and this won out over the hypernova for me. The nose on the hypernova was intense, smoky, medicinal (iodine), funky almost burnt tire...a little time in the glass and it had the familiar ardbeg smoked turkey smell

I need to have a few more pours to really focus on the palate, but I found hypernova less complex with a shorter finish. Initially earthy smoke, some honey sweetness, more than I expected. Medium oily texture and finish...

I think I enjoyed the nose the most in the hypernova unfortunately, we will see once I try it past the neck pour.

Am I mad I got it? No, but I would not buy it again at it's price point of 200 over their core lineup
In agreement here, not just a bit, but a lot thicker as I taste it.
I see it the same way as OP and prefer Ten and An Oa over Oogie and Corry. The latter ones are just a bit... flat to me compared to the Ten. And An Oa is a light, but delicious and fruity experience and even fits as a smoky summer whisky.
My guess is that the batches have thinned out over time, or I just happened to get a thin one. I’ve heard how thick it can be, but did not get that experience. I will still seek out some older batches to try here and there
 Corryvreckan
I recently had a dram (2 nights ago) and also found it to be quite thicker than the 10. I’m convinced each batch has more variance than I would have originally expected."

Wow, I have a few old Brora from chieftains choice, Dun Bheagan- same family Ian Macloed, Signatory Vintage  and Mckillops Choice. The 30yo 2007 55.7 is king IMO, it's also an official bottling. Glad I have plenty left to enjoy.
That's a bad mother****er right there my friend.  Cheers!
So far Chieftain’s bottlings I’ve had have been good! I have a Chieftain’s Bowmore 13 and I really enjoy it.
Would love to try some of those!

Had a chance to buy a 200ml bottle. After finishing it off over many months, I came to the following conclusion about buying a full sized bottle:

1. 33£/$40 in the UK?: fair price; I could buy another.

2. $73 in the US?: hahahahahahaha. effe you Diageo.
Nice review, not an easy one to review haha. Any spirit at 40% is going to be tough to find much besides the classic notes. This being $80 in my market makes it the hardest pass. I could maybe entertain getting a bottle of this if it were $20-$30 lower, but even then you have the Craigellachie 13 sitting there at $50 and it is proofed higher. Diageo owes it to Cragganmore to release a proper bottle.
Yes.  UK/EU prices are rational.  Diageo is committing brand suicide in the US
I agree with you on those points and have the Cragganmores to back it up.  This 12 at 46% would show alot of 46% darlings who's boss.  It was also a noticeable bit better 15-25 years ago with a slightly more peated malt a perhaps slightly less active casks.

Black pepper is a key note with this malt, like it is with Talisker."

Review #35 - Lagavulin 16 Year - 43% ABV

Nose: fish nets, charred meats, burnt strawberries, stale cigarette smoke, oyster shells, seaweed, brine, with a hint of vanilla, lemon, and moldy book pages

Palate: smoke, red fruits, pepper, cigar butt and tobacco, leather, salted fish, burnt brown sugar, a little citrus oil, earth, and brown mushroom. Thin mouthfeel. 

Finish: medium length finish. Charred caramel, pepper, burnt ends, lemon, and a hint of eucalyptus or mint

Final Thoughts: the flavor profile on Lagavulin 16 is fantastic. It’s like a fishing trawler caught fire in the middle of the ocean and someone decided to smoke meats over the flames and smoke of the wreckage. The alcohol is well integrated, there is a great balance between sweet and sour, smoke offset by fruit notes. Just very earthy and complex. That being said, the presentation could use some improvement. If this was 50% and non-chillfiltered it would be out of this world. But, the thin mouthfeel and lower ABV bring it down pretty heavily. Overall, wonderful Islay dram. 

Final Score: 87/100
This was my favorite scotch until they bumped the price up $40 in the span of 6 years
One of my favourites. Just to add to this, I've found that if the bottle sits for a while after it has been open the taste just becomes phenomenal. Not that the beginning of the bottle doesn't taste good either 😜
Pretty spot on review. 

Lag 16 is my benchmark for peated scotch. Not the best, just a standard to go by.
Instead of diving into the notes, or describing the stages of the tastes, I can only say it’s a pleasure to drink. A lot can be said about it’s lower (typically not my preference as I find myself a fan of cask strength whiskies) ABV, chill filtered, and artificial coloring, I can’t help but say I enjoy every sip and look forward to the next. The score I would give is highly dependent on context where in a cold winter night by a nearby a log burning fire and small group of friends who think they can solve the world’s problems, this whisky would get 100. If I’m at a whisky tasting and trying to find the sea salt between the smoke alongside other impressive whiskies, I would give this 85-88. All that being said, you can’t go wrong having it on your shelf.
There is a reason it’s typically so highly reviewed/recommended/enjoyed! 
Cheers! 🤠🥃🥃😁
How does non-chill filtering change the flavor profile?
Just tried this and wow I love it!
Excellent review!! I'd like to see a world wide boycott of Lagavulin 16yr until they raised the ABV to 48-50% and stopped chillfiltering and added no color !!
I'd pay an easy $200 cuz I think it would be one of the best Islay ever released! $300 if it was Cask Strength.

But, no...... So, I don't buy it especially with the way it's price in my area is going up and up.

Excellent review! Spot on.

Thanks for sharing!
Last bottle that I had I found to be way too Woody and tannic... 
 I realize that's what happens with long-term aged whiskey but I would rather have one of the younger versions that are more spirited (so to speak) and fruity...
The GOAT.
Where’d you get that glass? Very nice
Gah!  Sounds amazing. I keep trying to avoid it due to its cost… but seems right up my alley.
Am I crazy or is this not chill filtered?

I thought it was artificially colored, but still y chill filtered?
Same here.  I have a bottle that's been sitting 3/4 empty for a year that I'm afraid to finish because the price is so damn high.

I think it's the Offerman effect.  I like the man, I like his work with Lagavulin, and I like Lagavulin in general, but I think it's really served to jack the price up due to popularity and demand.
For real. What happened to this? It was available every time I looked for it for a great price for what you got and then jumped to $100+ a bottle and I can never find it. Anyone know why?
It’s well documented that it “thins out” the texture, and it removes a lot of the oily goodness that carries a bunch of flavor. There’s more technical jargon m, but that’s the gist of it.
Yea, I probably won’t buy another unless something changes
Look for festival releases. 

They’re uncommon of course, but they’re out there. And if your budget is $300, you’ll find what you seek.
Search for “Riedel VINUM Cognac Glass” and you will find it.
It’s chill filtered. Many European sites require that distillers disclose this information. So it’s out there
I see it here in Canada all the time it’s just $160 bucks now and seemingly goes up every month or so… When I first got into scotch 7-8 years ago it was in the $100-110 range.
I swore I remember that the beef with laggy 16 was artificial color, not chill filter.

Are you sure it’s chill filtered?
Speaking of, I found some hard to find Glen Scotias at Cask Strength coming out of Italy, of all places, to find the scotch you're looking for. 

Thanks for the suggestion.
Gotcha I was basing it off that one YouTube video I watched that one time so I’ve been educated now.
Still wild. I use to get it from 65-80 for a while in Los Angeles. I haven’t seen or bought it in a while so I don’t know what it is now but I got it like 1-2 years ago and it was around 100
It’s both.
Nice! Care to mention the site? 

I am indeed working on amassing Glen Scotias at the moment.
Well, to begin with, you need to pick up the Glen Scotia Victoriana it's at Cask Strength and only $89.99 in Michigan. As you probably know it was voted Best whisky in the World at the OSWAS. And deservedly so. 

Then because I have an idea of you closeness to Binny's. They have a single cask 1st fill bourbon barrel that is Cask Strength and only $99.99 . It's fabulous! You have to let it breathe and below the shoulders....oh my! If you search Binny's online store they tell you how many bottles are at each store and which are out of stock.

I got the 12yr Seasonal release at Cask Strength from the Whisky Shop in San Francisco as well as the very rare Glen Scotia 10year peated which I think is well worth the price, although the Whisky Shop has  what I think is quite high shipping costs but you have to bite the bullet if you want what you want.

Tell me if those are some you already have.
No Italian sources?
I thought I would give you the low hanging fruit first. And now I'll propose a trade.....you show me yours and I'll tell you about Italy and Belgium if you like.

How does that sound. Both online stores I've received shipments from and both have scotch we'll Never see in the States.

I recall you saying that Hazelburn 10 was in the Western Wisconsin area. Is that still true? If so, where?

Thanks in advance

Review #35 - Lagavulin 16 year - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/6gs0k6h4n4ia1.jpg,"Review #35 - Lagavulin 16 Year - 43% ABV

Nose: fish nets, charred meats, burnt strawberries, stale cigarette smoke, oyster shells, seaweed, brine, with a hint of vanilla, lemon, and moldy book pages

Palate: smoke, red fruits, pepper, cigar butt and tobacco, leather, salted fish, burnt brown sugar, a little citrus oil, earth, and brown mushroom. Thin mouthfeel. 

Finish: medium length finish. Charred caramel, pepper, burnt ends, lemon, and a hint of eucalyptus or mint

Final Thoughts: the flavor profile on Lagavulin 16 is fantastic. It’s like a fishing trawler caught fire in the middle of the ocean and someone decided to smoke meats over the flames and smoke of the wreckage. The alcohol is well integrated, there is a great balance between sweet and sour, smoke offset by fruit notes. Just very earthy and complex. That being said, the presentation could use some improvement. If this was 50% and non-chillfiltered it would be out of this world. But, the thin mouthfeel and lower ABV bring it down pretty heavily. Overall, wonderful Islay dram. 

Final Score: 87/100
one of my favorites scotch!
A very much appreciated trawler analogy.
I'm ambivalent about the 16. It took me a year to get through a bottle, and now I think the DE is far superior in sophistication.
This was my favorite scotch until I tried the 8 year.
What great words!!

Once you've had a cask strength Lag 12 SR, it's difficult to back to regular Lag 16.
Do you like it a lot more than the 8 year?
I like your description of smoking meat over a fishing boat on fire lol. I’ve also heard it described again and again as leather sofa soaked in seawater and set on fire. Both paint a good mental picture"
Review #34 - Woodford Reserve - Bourbon,,https://i.redd.it/qh3e6ghe6jha1.jpg,"Their rye, wheat and malt all top the bourbon IMO.

Nice review. This became my go to while working up the price point for  bourbon. Its in every store I go to which is probably why I keep going back for it. I didn't like double oak as much though.
A basic bourbon that drinks a little hot is the perfect way to describe this. Great review
Lots of caramel is what I took away from mine.
Thanks for the input. Definitely have had my eye on their malt.
Thank you!
Great way to describe it. It's not bad by any means, but for the pricepoint ($50 in Canada) I'd take Knob Creek 9, Elijah Craig Small Batch or Maker's 46 over it for sure.

Super underrated and personally my favorite of theirs. It leans heavily into bourbon but the the little bit of chocolatey sweetness from the malt goes a long way. Just talking about it I think I’m gonna have to grab another bottle tomorrow.
That's funny--I prefer WR to those other three options as I've felt they are all hotter.
Hah!  Thanks for this brother. Cheers"

"Single malts with barnyard, farm, and manure notes?","I’m no longer a noobie to scotch, and am looking for a single malt that has prominent notes of barnyard and farm. I’ve seen some reviews out there that even claimed a hint of manure. 

Which would you all recommend?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/10zamsu/single_malts_with_barnyard_farm_and_manure_notes/,"Benromach CS
If you can find it, Floki from Iceland is just one such whiskey.
Kilchoman Machir Bay.
Tobermory, Bruichladdich, and Springbank are the three that come immediately to mind.
Croftengea IBs
Craigellachie is 100% farm....but a clean farm. You will have to get your manure elsewhere
Some farmy notes I find also in Kilkerran 8 (I have the 56.9% abv) and Edradour 10 bottled by Signatory.
Tobermory especially (Tobermory 10 used to be famous for this: r/Scotch/comments/2otap7/review_18_tobermory_10_aka_butthole_whisky/ ), and also Ledaig - to my taste the peat tends to cover these notes, so they are more noticeable in Tobermory than in Ledaig. Although as another user commented already, they may have cleaned these notes up a bit in more recent distillations, especially since the distillery renovation which started 6 years ago ( https://whiskysponge.com/2017/02/15/tobermory-to-close-in-effort-to-discover-key-to-inconsistency/ ) - so time will tell if these are enduring notes or not.

In some expressions Kilkerran and sometimes Ben Nevis, Edradour & Ballechin.

More generally, I'd look to the partial triple distilled single malts, and/or those which use worm tubs or otherwise have oddball condensers (MacDuff, Dailuaine, late 1990s - early 2000s Fettercairn). Craigellachie for example tends to have farmy notes, to my taste.
There’s probably a lot of cheap Scotch that tastes like shit.
A lot of dusty IBs will have some of this. A lot of the non-standard Loch Lomond stuff gives me these notes, Old Rhosdhu, etc.
I’ve gotten those notes from bruichladdich and Ardmore bottlings before.
The dirtier Glen Scotia can often get these notes but it's always a guessing game when buying them.
Young independent bottles of ledaig that use recharred barrels.

Every one of these I've had was undrinkable for me. Because it was like drinking manure. I'm usually a huge ledaig fan but this note was insane everytime
Sounds like you want something from Campbeltown. I've only had Kilkerran 12 which wasn't particularly dirty, but then I prefer earthy, vegetal or mossy to manure funkiness. The Lagavulin 9 GOT Edition had some of that along with mild peat.
Benromach 10.
Valinch & Mallet Bruichladdich 15YR: hard to find but its a metric ton of manure
Port Charlotte is a great place to look for those notes; but aim for something distilled prior to c. 2010, thereafter those notes don't tend to be as strong IMHO.
I really don't understand some of the comments here. When I think farmyard, I think of bottles that preserve the character of the malt in ex bourbon barrels, and 2nd fill bourbon and sherry barrels. Bottles like Port Charlotte that have a peated component don't do it for me either as the peat really just takes over. sherry heavy drams also tend to dress up the farm with a lot of orchard and dark fruits. I often end up in christmas flavor territory.

Springbanks, bruichladdich classic laddie, Craigellachie would also be suggestions as posited by many but if the Classic Laddie wasn't enough, then this might be a tough hill to climb.

If you can find it, Bladnoch 10, otherwise the currently produced Bladnoch 11.
Malort
Sorry not scotch but whistlepig 10 tastes like a barnyard to me..   
  
On the non scotch note: Ancho Reyes Chile Liqueur tastes like straw followed by ancho chili heat
Tobermory might be along your alley.
Bruichladdich 150%
Bruichladdich, I would say especially Port Charlotte Islay Barley, but it occurs in some of the other PC's. Octomore  Islay Barley as well, the 6.3-9.3 all exhibited barnyardy notes. 

Some Springbank have this but it's hard to point to one specific one, It's not unusual to get sillage and barnyardy things happening. 

Ledaig/Tobermory although I think they are working to try and cut some of that out. 

Perhaps not specifically barnyard but some Waterford and Daftmill have very grain/field/flinty aspects that are adjacent maybe not super manure like but definitely agricultural
Bruichladdich. As barnyard as they come.
Ardmore 11 Cadenheads has a very farmyard flavour. It smells of burnt rubber and has hints of manure. In a good way.
This should be higher up on the list. It's basically their house signature
Seconded. One of them is literally 'peated' using sheep dung and it's by far the barnyardiest whisky I know. I don't particularly like it but it certainly fills OP's request.
Thank you!
What Loch Lomond exactly?
""dirtier""?
Thanks for the guidance and advice!
Thank you for this 🙏
Which bruichladdich expression? I didn’t really get any of these from classic laddie, but I’m assuming that’s because they want laddie to be inoffensive and accessible.
Awesome feedback! Thank you very much.
Any particular bruichladdich expression you’d recommend?
I think most 70s brora is much heavier on the barnyard notes than any bruichladdich I've had.
Came here to say exactly this haha
This was the most recent one I tried that popped into my head for this description: https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/196528/old-rhosdhu-1993-twa
I also found a really strong manure note in a young 2017 croftengea from claxtons.
All of them? I‘ve picked up a funky straw/hay note from all the Laddies I’ve tried
The Classic Laddie is a good place to start. Then one of the Islay Barley expressions and Port Charlotte 10."
Review #33 - Glengoyne 21 year - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/j621c4hffiga1.jpg,"Review #33 - Glengoyne 21 yr - 43% ABV

Nose: maple syrup, pancakes, caramel, crème brûlée, baking spices, bananas flambé, baking spices, sweet oak, a hint of dunnage and strawberries. 

Palate: brown sugar, mellow oak, berries and red fruits, dry hay, and a little sweet and sour. Medium-thin mouthfeel. 

Finish: medium finish. waffle cone, pepper, red wine/sherry, grape skins, green grass.  

Final Thoughts: this is definitely a bottle that needs time to open up as it breathes, and gets better as the bottle goes down. When I first tried it, the alcohol was not well integrated, and there was an astringent note on the front palette that I was not a fan of. However, after about a month it opened up into something awesome. The flavors are extremely well balanced and integrated. There is some good complexity beneath the surface, especially for a sherry-forward designed dram like this.

My wife arranged a tour of Glengoyne Distillery for my 40th (which I’d highly recommend), I forked out a pretty penny for this bottle. Speak about money well spent!

Definitely a Top 3 dram that’s passed my lips. Great review, thanks for posting.
Great review! I like the 18 a lot. I’ve been looking at getting this one as well and it sounds up my alley
Glengoyne 15 is still my white whale. Ive had a few of them and they are amazing, but can't be found any more.
This was (at the time) the oldest bottle I bought. At that time it was $150. Years ago mind you. Best value in whiskey at the time.

In my opinion Johnnie Walker Blue is the quintessential scotch for people who don’t drink scotch, but want to seem like they do. It’s low ABV makes it super sippable, and it has a thin mouthfeel and short finish so it’s not overbearing. I think there are some nice qualities, there’s some old leather and tobacco notes I get on the palate that are nice, but it’s value is abysmal at $250+ a bottle.
local place by me has $20 50ml's, or about $85 for the four bottle sampler. not a bad buy at all for the 4x 200ml's"

6. Getting hit by a truck
7. Red
It’s overpriced and has a somewhat simple palate but I enjoy it, one of my favorite JW’s after Blade Runner, Swing and of course the ghost and rares
Hollywood's Whisky
It’s a great bottle to gift or be gifted. It’s a pretty underwhelming bottle to buy with your own money for yourself to drink.
Had Johnny walker swing on Christmas and it was great. About 60$ bottle and better than blue label, I think.
I have some blue...nasty stuff.
🥔
Unfortunately, this is an extremely over priced scotch.
You’re spot on.
Absolutely. No question. I’ve appreciated the Green for years. When I finally got my hand on some Blue Label I was stunned at how inferior it was compared to Green Label.
Same. Green is good stuff!
If I want some good scotch but don’t want to think about it, JW green is usually what I go with.
I just tried this for the first time on Christmas Eve and had about the exact thoughts. It’s as drinkable as water and I just find that boring and uninspired. I’d much rather buy 4 bottles of Double Black because it has character and a finish.
😆
Nah, this is the opposite of a tatered bottle. Springbank is the only one really in that category when it comes to scotch.
rather buy 3 bottles of ardbeg than it, that's for sure or 3 bottles of a decent cognac.
I love double black
what does that mean? I‘ve read it a few times now, and springbank seems to be becoming quite scarce. Does it have go do with something being rare or discontinued?
For a whisky to be ""tatered"" means that demand outstrips supply so much that it cannot be found at most retail stores that don't apply a huge markup to it, and that most buyers are just buying it to resell on the secondary market. Both bourbon and scotch whisky have boomed equally in the 2010s, but ""tatering"" is mostly confined to bourbon because scotch producers are far more willing to actually raise their suggested retail prices to make demand equal supply. Springbank's whisky, however, is considered so much better than the competition that it is still flying off shelves and straight onto secondary even after a 100% MSRP increase.
Didn’t know that! I bought some springbank recently because it’s fantastic and is just flying off the shelves. So that’s the reason then… Thank you for taking the time to explain!"

I  mean I’ll review it I guess.

It is the smoothest scotch I’ve ever had almost to a flaw. It’s like they removed everything interesting to achieve the smoothness. I’d personally rather drink something with a little burn because this one is just kind of boring. Definitely not worth the price of the entire bottle but I highly suggest everyone try it once. I’d go for the gold reserve every time over this one.

7/10 purely because the price brings it down 2 points and it being boring brings it down another.

Review where?
I’ve tried JW blue… nah, next.
At only 80proof not much to expect
Comparisons to 18 yo?
I got a bottle of this from a friend a few years ago. Now I’m not a seasoned whiskey drinker, but I have to agree with the OPs review. It was smooth but really didn’t taste that good. I’ve had other whiskey that I liked, but this one not so much. It looks good on the shelf so that’s probably where it will stay.
Bottle got a boo boo
Could be an engraved bottle?
Sorry. Fixed it. Review in comments. It’s pretty much identical to what you said lol
It's a ""daily drinker"" for rich people (that prefer a ""rich""/full flavour profile)
My thoughts exactly. I have long felt that as you went up the original JW ladder (Red, Black, Gold, Blue) each step removed some harshness or perceived flaws, with the result being that the Blue was velvety smooth but lacking in character.
I totally agree JW Blue is boring. I like Green most among all JW products.
I like it as a well-balanced smooth blended scotch. I got some at 70 euros a long time ago which feels like a good price point. I wouldn’t pay 2 or 3 times as much.
If you want that Johnnie Walker profile for enthusiasts, you get the 15yo Green Lable: Pure Malt, age statement, 43% ABV. It's what your dads Black Label (despite the grain component) tasted like 40 years ago. I know, because I have a 40yo bottle of Black Label and current era Green Lable is damn close (if a little bit more malty, for obvious reasons, and a tad hotter).

Blue Label? It's what the uninitiated refer to as ""very smooth"", but what I'd call very boring. Frankly, I appreciate that Diageo has a JW expression that's clearly targeted at enthusiast market and is reasonably priced (and is, in every way, superior to the overpriced Blue Label).
Is the scotch or the reviewer bitter?  Choking on the pretentiousness here
It’s very delicious. Unreal smooth. There is a weird fad in whiskey culture to hate on it because that makes you smart and knowledgeable. Overpriced but very good.
Sorry. Not sure what happened. Fixed it. Review in comments
Hah no problem. I got mine with a gift set so I’m happy I tried it. Their Gold Label Reserve is what I hoped out of the blue.
Lol the funny thing is it really doesn’t have full flavor, it’s like muted.
Green label is great
I've had JW Blue a dozen times and have never been disappointed. I always felt for a blend it was really nice. Sweet, malty, old and smooth, with whispers of ripe fruit and light smoke. Is there better scotch for a third of the money, absolutely. But this is a bit pretentious.
Or maybe it’s that most would argue that Johnnie Walker Green or Gold are far superior to Blue yet charge a fraction of the price of Blue. It’s not that Blue can’t be appreciated, it’s that the price is so far out of whack that it needs to be reeled in a little bit.
Agreed 100% . It’s an excellent pour .
JW Blue is like a whole orchestra playing the same passages quietly. Also moving in unison is technically impressive and yet.. boring? Whereas whisky ""nerds"" are looking for virtuoso string quartets (single malts).

I appreciate JW but their flavour profile is certainly Scotch-adjacent. But .. I'm not a huge fan of Speysides.
Blue label is the prestige for the person without experience. It's fine. The best description is fine. It's not bad, and if you've never had a single malt, it's damn good. But there's a ton better, for a lot less. And once you're past the ooh blue label stage, it's just kinda...fine."

I did not get the thick, waxy notes that I’ve heard for so long about Clynelish. I got a medium thin mouthfeel with none of those waxy notes, and it seemed to lack some “oomph”. Maybe it is the chill filtration messing with it. I have a couple of independent bottlings of Clynelish (some older than 14, some younger) that I’ll do a compare and contrast on sometime in the future. 

Final Score: 82/100
Thanks for your thoughts on it.
Coincidentally, I‘ve opened the same bottle yesterday. And I agree. When I tasted it in Scotland, I thought it was an excellent one. Maybe it was compared to the other Whiskys on the fly.
Yesterday, however, it lacked some „oomph“, as you described it perfectly.
Still a great Whisky, though."

Clynelish distilled in the 2000s had an issue. They cleaned the equipment too thoroughly and it lost the waxy signature of Clynelish.
I see somebody else got a noticeable raw alcohol note out of Clynelish. People insisted the bottle I tried was somehow tainted when I reviewed it and complained about the ethanol on the finish. Needless to say this is not particularly good for something 14 years old.
it was definitely there and noticeable to me as well."

Ok, thank you for confirming it’s not just me. I bought a bottle from recommendations here. Like you said, the first few drams were pleasant. Now not so much. I was second guessing myself - did I miss something early on?  It really doesn’t hold up over the whole bottle.
I had this experience with this and the bunnahabhain 12. Started strong but wasn't enjoying it by the end.
Shoot!  I was actually going to pick up a B12 next!
Honestly I still would.  I really enjoyed that first half."

Completely agree with your review , ethanol dominates the flavour profile. Found it overpowering
I tried this about 10 years ago off a friend. I did not enjoy it due to the ethanol burn. I did not enjoy it.
Agree completely. I got a harsh alcohol taste that got worse as it aged. I was very disappointed. Jim McEwan would be disappointed.

Hahahaha
It’s batch 21/208
Unfortunate that it got worse over time.  This is my favorite scotch, therefore drained multiple bottles, and I’ve never experienced the loss of quality you described.  

The odds of you getting the one bad bottle are pretty low, so maybe it is batch specific as others mentioned?
If you go to Bruichladdich website, in the bottom of Classic Laddie page you can type the batch number in a box and you can see the exact vatting your bottle  includes."

Final Thoughts: I’ll just start with WOW! This is an absolutely amazing cognac. The grape candy blast is out of this world. The balance between fruit, floral, and spice is near perfect. It comes off as airy and delicate, and shows the craftsmanship that went into this. Vallein Tercinier is a fantastic cognac house, and for the money you really will not be able to find much better. For those that are early in their cognac journey and want to have their socks blown off, look no further. My only wish was that this had a slightly higher ABV. At 46-48% this would be a few points higher on my rating as I always prefer a little punch and to dilute myself if needed.

Final Thoughts: This is a very, very, very, different flavor profile from most scotches on the market. The chocolate malt really shines through. There is a definitive balance between salty and savory.  It really is a fantastic offering by Glenmorangie, and lives up to much of the hype. That being said, it loses a few points for me on price. It’s currently doing for $230-250 USD in my area, and at that price, I would not buy again, especially without the age statement. And yea, blah blah blah, I get they’re going for a certain flavor profile, but an age statement would really help at this price.

The price of this has gone through the roof. I got a bottle in an airport maybe 3 years ago for £70, obviously that was duty free, but it would have translated to around £85 at a shop. You’d be lucky to get it for double that now
Had a bottle of this for my wedding. Went down very well with everyone
Lovely whisky. Really enjoyable. I would recommend it to people but it’s so expensive now
If you're after something less expensive that hits a lot of the same notes (including that thick consistency), give Balcones Texas Rye a go. It's remarkably close despite, y'know, not being Scotch - and also really good.

Like you, I enjoy my bottle of Signet but won't buy it again. I WILL replace that Balcones, though, despite the import markup from getting American whisky in Norway.
>at that price, I would not buy again, especially without the age statement. And yea, blah blah blah, I get they’re going for a certain flavor profile, but an age statement would really help at this price. If this was at the $150 mark without the age statement, I’d be a lifelong buyer.

I'm curious about this. What would an age statement do for you exactly?

To me, age statement is just info. It doesn't mean it's a good pour — only the taste matters. When distillers put an age statement on, all it can be taken as is transparency about the process and a tacit promise not to fuck around with the recipe too much.

So maybe my question might be: are you worried it'll be different the next time you buy it?
Awesome recommendation. Thank you very much. I’ve been eyeing balcones for some time now.
It would partially justify the very high price tag by acknowledging I’m paying rent for older whisky.
Well, sure older whisky is more expensive to make, but there's a difference between cost to produce and value to the customer. And frankly, the cost to produce isn't *quite* the consumer's problem — it's just something distillers try to make us care about, because they *have to* care about it. If something younger (or NAS) tastes better — isn't that all that matters?

Here's an example: 8 year Lagavulin ($60) vs 16 year ($80). To those who prefer the 8, they might ask: ""Why spend $20 more for a worse drink?"" To those who prefer the 16, they might say: ""2x the maturation for 1.33x the price — what a value!"" ... *but* all that really matters is they believe the 16 tastes better than the 8, and they're willing to pay the extra $20. That's it!

Personally I've bought 3 bottles of Signet over the last 10 years. I really like it, but I agree with you that it's priced too high. I just think your method for arriving there is interesting.

Anyway best of luck to you.
Completely understand.

Here’s another example: You have 2 NAS whiskeys. Both are great and offer different flavor profiles from a lot of the whiskeys out there. One was $50 and the other was $250. Why would I ever want to continue to shell out $250 for a good whiskey when there are so many other great alternatives, barring other information, such as the cost to product, age, barley strains and provenance, etc…

I truly respect where your coming from, but distilleries can too easily get away with ridiculously priced whiskeys, hinting that they are old, fine, rare, and special, when in reality they are hiding far lesser whiskeys and charging an arm and leg for it. Not saying that Signet is doing this, but I’m also not positive that they aren’t, because they aren’t giving us concrete clues, such as an age statement. 

Cheers!
I don‘t know if an age statement always helps, since it does not give a good reference about the „real“ or „average“ age. If you have 699 ml of 50 year old scotch and add 1 ml of 10 year old to give it a bit more depth and complexity, then the age statement would be 10 year old (as far as I know). Especially for more complex formulations - combining different ages to gain depth in the whisky - an age statement could potentially lead to misinterpretation of quality and value quite fast.
If they want to do that and have a bunch of old stuff with a hint of younger stuff then do what compass box did with their 3 Year Old Deluxe. Tell people. Get the word about about ratios.
Correct: age statements only tell you the youngest whisky used, and nothing about the amounts.
In my opinion this would be a perfect solution. But with the current rules, I guess you would probably lose a lot of customers being confused by e.g. a „Dalmore King Alexander 12 year old“ with 40% abv for 190€ 😂 

Personally, I appreciate  age statements like „Compass Box 3 year old“, „Ardbeg 5 year old“ or „Bunnahabhain Staoisha 5 year old“. Still, I have no prejudice against NAS whiskies, since there are brilliant NAS expressions. NAS is not equal to „young whisky“, however, many may believe that.

But I am totally with you, I would love if Distilleries would be a bit more transparent, since I try to gather information about my next purchase, before I spend the money 🙂"

Age is just a number and should have no influence on the scoring based on actual nose, taste and finish imo. I've heard rumors that Signet has a small portion (maybe 10 to 15%) of 35 to 40 year old, 50% ish of 18 to 25 year old and the rest in the 12 to 18 range. I wouldn't age it because you'd be calling it 12 and that's just a dishonor.
Why do you care how old the whisky is? Shouldn’t it just be about the taste?
""Without the age statement""


You mean marketing?
Close.  E149.
Age statement is simply a FACT about the whisky you are buying. How is that marketing?

I will argue that more often than not it is the non aged stated releases that are absolutely loaded with marketing fluff:

Glenmorangie A Tale of Cake and Winter

Johnnie Walker Blue

Macallan Rare Cask

Dalmore King Alexander

Macallan Rich Cacao

Macallan Edition series

Highland Park Viking this and that

Many Ardbeg special releases
I live in Fort Worth Tx, but the place is in Arlington right down the Highway at a restaurant called Mac’s Bar & Grill.
$18 a shot and you think that's cheap?

I thought that whole bottle costs like $190.
Aren’t you contradicting yourself? You said age shouldn’t matter. Yet you are also saying they won’t put a 12 year age statement because thats a dishonor. 

Age matters. Period. You just proved it with your comment.

For me age matters but many things matter. Its one of the factors to calculate value.  Do you buy cars that don’t disclose how much horsepower it has?

Age statements are very important for future purposes. I can buy a bottle of a NAS that is excellent. But how do I know if the next batch will be even close? How do I know if the next batch won’t use significantly younger and more harsh whisky? I don’t. At least with an age stated whisky I know I will get a certain age.

Look at Abelour Abunadh and Ardbeg Uighdahl. Compare the original batches to what we get now. They are significantly younger and worse. Now compare that to Laphroiag 10 cask strength and Springbank 12 cask strength. The quality has been much more consistent the last 10 years.
Would you buy a car not knowing how much horsepower it has?  Would you buy a home not knowing how old it is? Would you buy a computer not knowing what type of cpu it has?

Since when is having LESS FACTS about a whisky a good thing? Age is a very important element of a Scotch. It isn’t everything but it is important. Its about transparency and disclosure. Especially on a bottle costing $250. 

IMO age statements are important for future purposes. You could buy a NAS that is excellent. But what about the next batch? You have no idea. The next batch could have whisky that is MUCH YOUNGER and of lesser quality. You have no idea. With an age statement at least you have the peace of mind that you will get a similar age product as your previous bottle. This has happened MANY TIMES. Look at Ardbeg Uighdahl and Abelour Abunadh. Those use to have significantly older whisky in it. Quality has gone down alot. Now compare those to Laphroiag 10 cask strength or Springbank 12 cask strength. The quality is much more consistent.
Shouldn't it be about both? To me, the more information about the whisky, the better. I don't necessarily need an age statement on the bottle. I wish more companies were doing what Ardnamurchan is doing with transparency. I love that you can scan the bottle and see every cask used in that batch. There's an example of young whisky that, to my taste, is fantastic. So, I think it should be about the taste and not just a number, but I also love the ability to know what went into that bottle to help me make sense of what I am tasting and to be able to compare future bottles from different batches.
You think an age statement is only marketing? lmfao
Age statements are not marketing. They are the exact opposite. They are cold hard facts that can help you make an informed buying decision.

Would you buy a car that doesn’t disclose its horsepower? Would you buy a used car not knowing how many miles it was driven?

One the other hand a whisky with no age statement could have whisky of any age. It is usually these non age statement bottles that are littered with marketing fluff.

I could buy a bottle of this Glenmorangie that is excellent. But how do I know if the next batch will be similar? How do I know if the next batch won’t use significantly younger and more harsh whisky? I won’t because there is no age statement. This has happened to Ardbeg Uighdahl and Abelour Abunadh. The batches are getting younger and younger and quality is significantly worse than 10 years ago. Compare that to Laphroiag 10 cask strength and Springbank 12 cask strength. The quality of those age stated releases have been way more consistent. 

It’s weird how recently people are looking down at age statements. And mocking people who view it as an important data point for buying decision. When is having LESS FACTS about an item a good thing? This is about disclosure and transparency. And this is especially important to many when buying a $250 bottle.
What ? If anything, age statement is the *absence* of marketing. Source: every major distillery adding NAS bottlings with some storytelling to compensate. See Highland Park's viking tattoos, Ardbeg's weird pun-based limited releases, Glenmorangie's tales of whatever, etc.
Age statement tiers (12, 15, 18, 21, etc.,) were actually created by marketing departments in the 90's to manufacture a market for the glut of high aged single malts.  Much like the tiered classifications in the French wine industry, age statements were used to justify premium prices and solidify old scotch as a luxury good.  And it worked.  30 year old Maccallan that sold for $300 in the 90's now sells for 20x that.
I never said the age statement was marketing. As you said, its a fact. I said the association between age and quality or the idea that higher aged juice is higher quality is a marketing ploy.
So you’ve got Greg Abbot as your governor, a power grid that will blow a fuse in January, uhhh….  don’t mess with Texas, and cheap Signet.

Yeah, I’m on my way I’m leaving right now.
>Age matters. Period. You just proved it with your comment.


I didn't at all. I proved the argument that it makes no sense to put an age on this bottle. It does not matter to me but it can influence marketing, sales, perception, etc. and therefore should not be included on this one.

As for the rest it's just subjective but I would rather stand behind my taste buds than an age statement. Same for horsepower. While it is posted info sure I don't choose my car based on it at all. I chose my car based on practicality and how it drives during a test drive. I don't compare horsepower and pick the biggest donkey.

But that's just me to each their own.

Edit. I guess I will put it like this. If you said it tasted young and you wish it had more age to change the flavour and you wanted an age to he able to see that in writing I would get it. But just to write a number on the bottle for the sake of it seems moot. By writing 5, 10, 12, 20, 30 it doesn't change anything about what you are drinking and whether you like the flavour or not.

me if it had the ages and percentages of all the whisky’s in the bottle.  But as it stands almost no distiller is ever going to give that info.  

We know that an age statement only states the youngest whisky in the bottle.  And the average buyer is not half as savvy as you or I.  What if the youngest whisky in the original Signet was 18 yrs old then a few years later they thought that they were getting a better flavor from a 17 yr whisky?  (But still probably using some 20-30 yr old stuff)  The casual buyers that sometimes drive the market would be turned off if they saw the 18 go to 17.  I don’t blame Glenmo for not putting an age statement on the bottle.

I also think an age statement stifles creativity in blending.  Look at what Barrell is doing with mostly North American whiskeys.  They’re making some of the best stuff in the game but an age statement could hurt their marketing (yes, I said MARKETING) if they use a young whiskey, even if the flavor is superior.

I have a bottle of Signet that I’ll open on Christmas.  Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
Exactly. Blows my mind when people view FACTS (age statement) to marketing. For some reason it has become fashionable lately to look down on age statements. I can’t understand why a consumer would want to know LESS about the product than more.
How many sub $300 bottles use aged statements as a marketing ploy?
Did you see my examples of Abelour Abunadh and Ardbeg Uighdahl getting worse as time goes by?  Thats the danger with NAS. The formula of the Scotch can change drastically and you won’t even know it. Its way too easy for distilleries to sneak in younger whisky. And that is exactly what Abelour and Ardbeg has done. They have put much younger whisky in the bottle as the years go by. Compare an Abelour Abunadh from 10 years ago to a recent batch. It’s night and day. 

Now contrast that with Laphroiag 10 cask strength and Springbank 12 cask strength. Quality has not dropped at all. In fact some of the recent batches are some of the best. 

I don’t understand why you are against knowing what you are buying. 

Your point that you base your score only on what it taste like. That is fair. But without an age statement there is zero guarantee that the next bottle you buy will even have half the age of your current bottle. How can you possibly give a recommendation when you have no idea if next months batch will be far younger and worse.

Age statements are not marketing. They are FACTS. The more FACTS consumers have the better decisions they can make.
I get where you are coming from (and agree that the buyer should get as much information as possible) but at the same time the age statement will make zero difference if the youngest whisky they include remains twelve throughout the years but they drastically change the composition of the older barrels.
Okay so what do you want them to do with Signet? Let's say it's a mix of 30YO down to 8YO. Labelling it as an 8 doesn't change a thing in terms of ensuring quality. If they chnaged the blend from 10% 8YO to 90% one day the label wouldn't change but you bet the taste would.

Isn't that exactly what supposedly happened with Uigeadail? It used to have more extra-old sherry casks in it, which now (probably) makes up much less of the blend. An age statement wouldn't have stopped the deterioration of Oogie.
Then maybe they would stop using 8 year Scotch.
Then it would be a completely different whisky, and probably 5 times the price. Signet is a fantastic dram - why do you want them to stop making it?
Lol. What is so special about the 8 year whisky"
Review #27 - Glenmorangie Signet - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/y8ksw9mzj2w91.jpg,"Review #27 -Glenmorangie Signet - 46% ABV

Nose: Old books, moldy sawdust, wet leather, mushroom, miso paste (fermented soybean), gravy, dirt, furniture polish, hint of orange zest

Palate: cereal, toffee, chocolate/mocha, coffee, dunnage funk, light pepper and hints of cognac-like rancio, umami, and orange. Medium thin mouthfeel. 

Finish: Long finish, baking spices, coffee, chocolate. 

Final Thoughts: This is a very, very, very, different flavor profile from most scotches on the market. The chocolate malt really shines through. There is a definitive balance between salty and savory.  It really is a fantastic offering by Glenmorangie, and lives up to much of the hype. That being said, it loses a few points for me on price. It’s currently doing for $230-250 USD in my area, and at that price, I would not buy again, especially without the age statement. And yea, blah blah blah, I get they’re going for a certain flavor profile, but an age statement would really help at this price. If this was at the $150 mark without the age statement, I’d be a lifelong buyer.  

Final Score: 86/100
I pull this one out from time to time just to confuse my whisky friends. This is to scotch what Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend is to bourbon.   Just a vastly different profile. Love it.
Saw this at my local liquor store and almost pulled the trigger. Maybe I’ll go get a pour first to try it out
I did enjoy this bottle in the past. Reminds me that I should get another one soon! Looks like it’s a little less where I am.
Really enjoyable and unique whisky in my opinion
The coffee flavor on this one is pretty bonkers. It's totally unique. I think it's a great desert pour.
I agree with your statement regarding price. I know we should not be set on age statements, and that an age statement doesn’t necessarily make a whiskey better than a NAS one. 

But when you are paying over a certain price, you would like to see that number. 

I’m lucky that I picked this bottle up for 130€ earlier this year during a sale. It’s around 180€ now but I’d still replace it since the flavour profile is so unique! Having said that, if the price rises even more, I’ll look elsewhere and just cherish the memory
It’s why I love Compass Box.  They will give you every detail of every bottle if you send them an email.
Would definitely recommend getting a pour first, even though the pour will be as expensive as some bottles probably. I actually tried it 2-3 times before I bought my bottle.
Agreed. Love it!  Very unique."

Nose: vanilla, oak, maple syrup, cherry, baking spices, fresh shoe polish. 

Palate: cherry, oak, leather, tobacco, vanilla, caramel, black pepper, plums, and raisins. Medium mouthfeel. 

Finish: medium short finish, with vanilla caramel, maple syrup and oak prominent, trailing off with those hints of cherry. 

Final Thoughts: This was a local store pick for Russell’s Reserve. This is the definition of a great daily sipper. Full of your bourbon flavors, high quality, and at a decent price. For those that enjoy your straightforward excellent Bourbon, this one is definitely for you. Obviously, as this is a store pick there is going to be some wide variation, but overall, you can expect a decent bourbon. For me, I tend to like flavors that are a little more bold, challenging and complex, so I will probably hold off buying a bottle, but would love to have this as a gift or an occasional bar/restaurant pour. It’s good stuff

Final Score: 80/100
These are going for $85 locally now. Good stuff but prices are getting crazy.
Yes, not private barrel selection...but RR 10 year is my daily drinker. Tasty, smooth and only $34.
Awesome review for an awesome whiskey!
I was thrilled to find a pick for $65 yesterday. Not opened yet, but soon. Thanks for the review.
Dang. It’s still $60-70 tops where I’m at.
My local TW has a pick that was $92!!!  Was about $65 not that long ago
Bought a bottle as a gift for $78 tonight.
Every bit as good as eagle rare, and available everywhere. The private barrel is a step above, but they are getting pricey.
Savor that pick for 65. I've seen them as high as 90 recently. Turkey has been raising their prices in Kentucky at least.
It was $65 about 6 months ago.
I also so one for 92 at total wine in Louisville yesterday. I cannot justify that cost :(
TW are marking theirs up for some reason. Screw em.
Yep my total wine has a pick and wants $82 for it…..
[deleted]
Yes, I believe it was total wine. 92 for private select, 85 for normal single barrel. Cox’s had it for ~85. Some small stores north of bardstown also had it for ~85.
Yeah my TWs pick is $80. (I passed on that one and picked one of the same age up from a smaller store across town and saved $1p, luckily.)"

Review #25 - Monkey Shoulder Batch 27 - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/eiph9fud3wu91.jpg,"Review #25 - Monkey Shoulder Batch 27- 43% ABV

Nose: Cereal, light oak and leather, sand, grapes and red orchard fruits, books

Palate: sweet and sour, hint of salt, white wine, caramel vanilla, waffle cone, and sweet oak. Medium thin mouthfeel.

Finish: Heavy grass, earth, pepper and spice, and a bit of that dunnage. Medium length finish. 

Final Thoughts: When it comes to scotch, I am much more of a single malt fan as I have had a number of bad blends throughout the years. I continued to hear good things about Monkey Shoulder, especially about the value for the money, so figured I would give it a try. I was glad I did. This is a both a very accessible scotch for beginners, but also has some great complex flavors for those further along in their whisky experience. Every one of my friends new to scotch that tried this loved it. I was very surprised at how well the alcohol was integrated, and how the initial hit of sweet and sour moves to salinity and then finishes off with a really deep and pleasant grassy flavor.  This stuff at 50%+ ABV would be killer, but for $35 USD, I’m not complaining at all. Well done Monkey Shoulder. 

Final Score: 75/100
I have tasted this alot and have never tasted vanilla or caramel.
Great review! Agreed that this one is great for value - in our eyes, slightly better than many of the common blends, but still around the same price point. We’ve found this as low as $23-25 US
I don’t understand why it had to be stronger to taste better.
Mate I've drank Whisky all my life and never tasted 90% of the things listed by these tasters. You could drink coca cola and if you concentrate hard enough, probably taste hints of orange peel, burnt wood and cinnamon...
Google *super tasters*. Some people are genetically disposed to having more taste buds and being able to distinguish flavors better. I'd almost guarantee the OP is one of them. Sadly I am not.
You don’t smell the SAND?!?
Because the initial flavor delivery is muted and weak. Higher ABV generally aids that.
Higher proof spirits are more full flavor than the 43 or 46% version of the same spirit.
Here’s a test take a sip of any whiskey after 10 minutes add some water and the take another sip and you just answered your own question"

A favorite affordable scotch. I always keep a bottle in the cabinet.
I like to think I'm relatively new to the scotch game, having been a bourbon man for a long time. But I love monkey shoulder. I keep coming back to it, it's a great drop, and this is a great review.
The way this ends in a tangy orange potpourri note just ruins it for me, I have tried to like it. Prefer things like Shackleton way more for sub-$40 blends
My favorite.
[deleted]
Haven’t had Shackleton before. Will have to add that to my list! Thanks for the feedback
You (and probably OP) are missing the distinction between ""blended"" and ""blended malt"". Blended contains grain whisky (usually a lot and often cheap) as well as malt whisky while blended malt is, just like single malt, 100% malted barley. You're right that OP might be a little misguided here since Monkey Shoulder is a blended malt and not a blended, and I completely agree on the ""cheap whisky"" comment.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/n5nzwo/psarant\_blended\_and\_blended\_malt\_are\_two\_quite/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/n5nzwo/psarant_blended_and_blended_malt_are_two_quite/)
Nah, very aware of the distinction. Had some bad Johnny Walker Green and Famous Grouse back in the day that made me think twice before diving back into blended malts.
Gotcha! But did you mean Naked Grouse, perhaps?"
Review #24 - Appleton Estate 12 year - Rum,,https://i.redd.it/vjd6ksvyovu91.jpg,"Not very often someone dislikes the 12. It's my absolute favorite.
To each his own though :)
I find the older version better (with the screw top). If you can find the 15 year old, I highly recommend it.
Rum's not for everybody, I guess.
Review #24 - Appleton Estate 12 Year - 43% ABV

Nose: burnt sugar, thick molasses, burnt plastic, oak, floral bouquet, and a little stagnant tidewater thing going on

Palate: Not a lot of flavor on the front of the palate. This is extremely muted. Oak, molasses, lilac, and plastic (which many may refer to as Jamaican funk). Thin mouthfeel. 

Finish: Medium finish. More of the flavors and nuance begin to pop out. Baking spices, cardamom, clove, oak that’s gone slightly bad, black currant. 

Final Thoughts: The nose is the best part about this drink. You get that Jamaican funk that many talk about, but overall, I am underwhelmed by this rum. The ABV needs to be kicked up a notch, and even then, I’m not confident that the flavor would really pop. The drink is way too bland, and there’s an “off taste” to the flavor that is there. The most positive thing I can say is that the alcohol is very well integrated. Won’t be picking up another bottle any time soon. 

Final Score: 49/100
I just got into real rum and this was my second bottle. This is amazing and such a great price point!
I 100% agree with you, OP.  I love Jamaican rums and find the 12 extremely underwhelming.  I'm always so curious what others like about it because to me it's very bland.
The 15 is the one my heart loves!
I'm with OP on this one. I absolutely love rum, and Jamaican rum to be specific. This one though, (and anything by Appleton) just seems so lacking in flavor by comparison.
How would you say the 15 differs when compared to the 12?
Rum is great. Just not this one for me though.
Too bad that you did not like it. And good that you still speak out knowing that this rum is loved in this rumdit. I like your 'stagnant tidewater thing' description: it's great how smells and flavors can take us to very specific situations or places.
[deleted]
I bought a bottle of the 12 a couple of weeks ago and I do agree a lot with what kaedoge wrote.

IMO, the nose on this rum is awesome - utterly delicious - lots of (red) fruit, musty oak, a whiff of ripe banana, maybe a little leather. I find though, that a lot of those notes don't make the transition from nose to palate, which is slightly disappointing.

I agree that the flavours in the main body of rum are really dialed back. There's a bit of oak, some baking spices - not a lot going on. I have to really swill it around my mouth to try and pick up on some of the flavours. It is in the aftertaste when the rum starts to shine - Again, I get more oak, more of the baking spices but also a nice banana (bread) comes though, a little red fruit and the sweetness slowly builds. The aftertaste though is relatively short-lived.

I really do like the rum and will definitely be getting more in the future but it definitely could do with an increase in ABV to give it a bit more oompf. I have been fortunate enough to try the 21 and that totally blows this out of the water, as you would expect.
You know what they say... Same strokes... For... S.. same strokes all the folks? Hehehehe 


This is my favorite for the price. A staple in my house. Whereas I don't like most Jamaican funk rums (like Appleton's 8yr) this one I found forward with vanilla wafer flavor and a smooth but buttery finish and delivery of that vanilla wafer type flavor. Not so much musty funk.
I’m late to your post but I searched this subreddit to see if anyone agreed with me. I think Appleton Estate 12 is overrated and I don’t understand this subreddits obsession with it. I only purchased it because everyone here hyped it up, but I couldn’t finish the bottle and gave it away to a friend so at least someone would drink it. Other recs on this sub like Ron Zacapa, Pussers 15 are all on point. Appleton is just way overpriced. I wouldn’t mix it with coke, but I also won’t drink it neat.
For me, Jamaican Rums starting out were a bit too funky. I started with Smith & Cross because it gets all the rave reviews, but coming into rum from a history of some bourbon and mostly beer, S&C felt like someone was pouring alcohol through an athlete's sock.

Appleton 12 on the other hand was extremely smooth while having bit more of an interesting flavor, and when I did a rum tasting with a friend, it made my favorite daiquiri. 

Drinking A12 helped me get to the point where I now appreciate some more funky rums like S&C and Hamilton's pot still black, even if they're still not my favorite. While pricey for an intro bottle, for me, it was a great place to start developing that taste.
That seems to be the consensus. That the older years pack way more flavor.
Hit my with the names of those flavor bombs.
The 15 is so much richer and deeper in flavor. For me it was like cleaning a dusty mirror and finally seeing the mirror image properly. And I like the 12.

Before tasting it I was sceptical about the 3 extra years, since it already has 12 years of maturing. And perhaps even more a out the 50% price increase between the two of them. After tasting, I would say the price is a lot better justified. Tempted to buy the 15 instead of the 12 once my bottle is finished.
I think they just don't like Jamaican rum/esters
Not all of these are Jamaican only. 

Smith & Cross, Hamilton Pot still black/gold, doctor bird, denizen 8, probitas, rum fire, wray and nephew. I haven't tired rum bar by worthy park but I hear good things.
Bold statement! :D I'll put the 15 on my list!
I love Jamaican hogo, but that’s also the reason I don’t really like Appleton. It is indeed a bit bland
I will finish the bottle in case you don't like it ;)

Great review. 

I like your Dutch Delft tile almost as much as I like this scotch!
I was inspired by your review to go back to the Springbank 10 and Hazelburn 10 I opened a year ago. As I was going back and forth between the two the Springbank stayed pretty steady, wonderful. But the nose of the Hazelburn kept shifting, peaches, soft ginger, honeydew Amazing!!!!

Thanks for sharing and inspiring the tasting. I'm still blown away! I think Hazelburn 10 is rarer than Springbank.

Enjoy
Name checks out. :)

Glad you enjoy as much as I do.

I'll be back. Thanks for the inspiration I needed a break from my Peat Addiction.
I love me some peat, but Hazelburn is just fantastic. Glad to have brought some inspiration :)

Final Thoughts: Nose is better than the palate. The front palate is better than the mid or finish. It drinks just fine, but won’t blow any socks off.

Final Thoughts: Nose is better than the palate. The front palate is better than the mid or finish. It drinks just fine, but won’t blow any socks off. Will do the job for an every day sipper if you’re looking for a safe, middle of the road Whiskey. My two cents, there’s far more interest stuff out there. 

Final Score: 62/100
One of the more disappointing bottles I’ve had. Got a bottle when then (re)opened the distillery and 
sat on it for a few years. Just not a lot there to enjoy
Rubber, cinemon, and ethanol? That's interesting.

I bought one a little over a year ago and did not taste any spice. Mine was pretty smooth and a ton of butter. What a shame.
I bought one and felt I got my money’s worth with a good $30 bourbon and a $20 decanter.
I had this on one large cube of ice after having a George Remus.

Remus tasted better. This was just there. Neither had a kick.
Had this out and about one nigh…wasn’t a fan
Big disappointment in my book. Couldn’t get past the raw ethanol taste. I think it’s buried under the sink somewhere now. I sure as hell didn’t polish it off
I haven’t tasted this in about a year but I don’t remember enjoying it at all.
I definitely got the buttery smoothness up front.
Well dang. Hopefully the next bottle is better!"
Review #21 - R.L. Seale’s 12 year - Rum,,https://i.redd.it/x99ztw57y2s91.jpg,"Review #21 - RL Seale’s 12 year- 46% ABV

Nose: dunnage funk, brown sugar, maple syrup pancakes, citrus (orange, lemon, lime), light oak, wet leather

Palate: red hot cinnamon (in a good way and not like fireball), hard ethanol kick right up front, then come out the strong brown sugar, maple, and funk. The funk being kind of like old library books that got wet and started to go bad (again, I do not meant this is bad, just different).  Medium thin mouth feel. 

Finish: medium-long finish. Buttery maple and brown sugar, pepper, baking spices, orange, sweet oak. 

Final Thoughts: For the price, this rum is a winner for me. Normally, a slap of ethanol in the face up front can be a deterrent, but this rum balances out the heat so well on the mid and rear palate. It’s like it takes you for a ride. RL Seale is the dude putting out most of the top notch Barbados rum (Foursquare, Doorlys, etc), and his own version here is right at the top. I’d still take the Foursquare vintages over this one, but for the $50 USD I paid for this bottle, it was an excellent value. 

Final Score: 85/100
I prefer the 10 year and it’s only about 25-30. SOLID VALUE!!
Drinking this right now. It’s a nice alternative to the higher priced Foursquare offerings. Still really enjoy those but this makes a great less expensive daily sipper.
This one is sitting in my cart so it's good to know it's rock solid.

It must be the column distillate but Foursquare is always very thin on the mouthfeel for me. Makes it a bit hollow. But still sounds up my alley
I've had this one and was impressed. How does the 10 year compare? It's about $15 less for the 10 year near me.
What an interesting bottle. I’m kinda drunk so… lol
Legit just bought this over the weekend. Enjoy it alot.
I was disappointed by this when I tasted it 6 or so months ago.  I need to re-taste it and write a review.  Thanks for the inspiration!
It's my favorite Barbados rum
>RL Seale is the dude putting out most of the top notch Barbados rum  
  
Just to point out, R.L. Seale refers to Reginald Leon Seale, not Richard Seale who is the current master distiller at Foursquare.
I pay $26 for the 10 year, hard to convince me that 2 more years and a couple proof points is almost double the price. Wonderful expression though, loads of vanilla
Username checks out.
That one holds a special place in my heart since it was the first truly good* rum I ever bought and drank.

* By good I mean stuff that wasn't generic schlock like Kraken, cheap brands, or cheap expressions of name brands.
I actually prefer the 10yr.
I’ve never had the 10 year. So I’d be curious as well
It was $36 at Costco last time I bought some, there really isn't much difference except the 10 year is a total wine thing.
I got mine somewhere local other than total wine, they must use the same distributor. To be fair this place also has kirkland brand stuff so they may source from different places. I've never asked
There are laws in many states that prevent one retailer from having a monopoly on an alcohol product or brand. So you’ll find that stuff like Kirkland products or Total Wine exclusives will be offered to at least one other retailer in the state."
"Recommendations needed for a savory, unpeated, unsmoked, scotch?","Looking for some of your favorite scotch options that really highlight the savory and earthy notes in a scotch. I’ve seen many recommend peated and smoked scotches that hit a savory note, but I am looking for good ones that aren’t peated or smoked. 

Let’s hear from you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/xm1kp5/recommendations_needed_for_a_savory_unpeated/,"Mortlach and pre-2007 Benrinnes tend to have savory, meaty notes probably coming from their use of partial triple distillation. I'd throw Balmenach in there too as having meaty notes.

The Fettercairn Warehouse 2 series may be worth investigating - I have batch #3 and it has some earthy / chocolate fudge notes which may perhaps reflect the red wine casks in that vatting, the dominant notes in it are tropical fruit.

North Star Spirits recently released a youngish (13) Braeval that to my taste has notes of chocolate biscotti, along with being a bit hot & sour-fruity.

Agree with the multiple suggestions being made here re: Tobermory, to me it tends to have a sort of farmy, old manure pile funk to it.

And for something a lot easier to find, Craigellachie 13 has a bit of the funky/savory character which seem to show up at worm tub sites.
Tobermory, Ardmore, some Fettercairns and Glenturrets
worm tub stuff like craigellachie, mortlach with sherry barrels
Tobermory 12 definitely.
Craigellachie 13 has some savory notes.
Old Pulteney.
Is Clynelish kinda savory and waxy? Ardnamurchan A/D AD/04.22:02, Bruichladdich Islay Barley, Bere Barley.
I would say Old Pulteney as well
Although I missed a chance to buy it, Glen Garioch was once mentioned to me as unusual in a ""savory"" way, as well as Craigellachie. When I think of savory I envision herbal and maybe a bit ""mossy"" as opposed to sweet or smoky. Some mention ""barnyard funk,"" but the thought of rotted hay or manure in liquid form makes me shudder.
Macallan does some nice quality plain-ish scotch. I like the 12 year old.
Savory but Not smoky - interesting. 

Im thinking port cask whiskeys maybe.

* [Malt Map](http://scotchgit.bitbucket.io/)

The malt map can be especially valuable for exploring different flavor zones and for identifying scotches similar to a particular bottle you enjoy.

&nbsp;

Please try to be as specific and detailed as possible with your request. Tell us:

* your budget
* which whiskies you or your giftee have enjoyed
* which bottles you’re considering now
* where you live (pricing and availability can vary dramatically by region)
* if your shop has a limited selection or you might have trouble shipping bottles so we don’t recommend something obscure

&nbsp;

**General Tips**    
We generally advise novices to sample as much as possible by going to a bar, splitting bottles with friends, attending festivals/tastings or getting minis to ensure you buy bottles you enjoy. Most people need to try at least 20-25 scotches to understand their preferences. It may make more sense for you to focus on sampling rather than buy full bottles at the beginning of your journey.

You're going to get the most flavor/aroma drinking it neat in a tulip-shaped glass like a Glencairn but most new drinkers prefer to water down their whisky a bit. If you do end up adding water, we usually recommend adding just enough to make it tolerable and take small sips. But really there's no right or wrong way to drink so as long as you're enjoying it, you're doing it right. Thanks for reading, cheers!
Two come to mind off the cuff…

Hazelburn 10 

Gordon and MacPhail Mortlach 15 (tastes like toasted rice puffs)
Glen Garioch has a meatier and more spicy character than many other non-peated or mini-peated Highlanders
Do you mean that (partial) triple distilling would increase these flavors? I thought it would be the opposite if anything.
What is similar to Ardmore? It's one of those malts I've been wanting to try for years, but can't seem to find around here (save an independent bottle of 12 years that came and went in the blink of an eye)
And Royal Lochnagar Selected Reserve if you're lucky enough to find it.
Came here to say this.  On the label, they describe their whisky as having a “rich, meaty character”
I would always say Old Pulteney ;)
""Partial triple distillation"" seems to have effects that are counter intuitive vs. the name. One might think that as it purportedly represents *more* distillation than mere double distillation, this would push the flavor profile in the same direction as true triple distillation, that is towards being more clean, with a more narrow range of congeners.

But in practice it seems to do the opposite of that. Partial triple distillation at each of Springbank, Mortlach and Benrinnes seems to produce a more dirty and complex new make. My guess is that the way in which the feints and foreshots are recycled for further distillation rather than being discarded produces a complex multivalent set of pathways thru the distillation regime, thus congeners which are on the shoulders of the middle cut have a greater opportunity to sneak thru and make it into the final spirit cut. This seems to be especially the case with heavier ones that would normally be discarded as feints, and all of these malts are to my taste a bit on the feinty side, and at times a bit sulfurous - but this means that they stand up well vs. aggressive cask maturation.

Worm tub sites show similar characteristics insofar as the spirit has less contact with copper during condensation and thus more sulfurous compounds can make it into the new make spirit, than would be the case with a cleaner condensation regime. Similar effects can occur with shell and tube condensers under special circumstances, such as the infamous stainless steel shell and tube condensers installed at Fettercairn from the late 1990s thru 2007, and stainless steel used for a similar span of time at Dailuaine, or the conventional copper shell and tube condensers at MacDuff which are odd because they are mounted horizontally rather than in the normal vertical orientation.

Review #20 - Bunnahabhain 12 year - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/81234vksqxo91.jpg,"Review #20 - Bunnahabhain 12 year- 46.3% ABV

Nose: Fresh red fruits, especially strawberry, sherry/wine, salinity, seaweed, maple syrup, light oak, and the faintest whiff of charcoal smoke

Palate: Medium thick mouthfeel. Sweet and sour, strawberry, salt, sweet baking spices with brown sugar  and vanilla prominent, with a white pepper kick on the real palate. Alcohol is very well integrated and balanced. 

Finish: Sweet and sour, fresh strawberries remain, with a slightly smoky note on the finish.  But just a small, small, note of smoke, almost blending in with the pepper note. Medium length finish. 

Final Notes: I love this dram. Unpretentious, complex flavors, delicious. You get to go through an evolution of the whisky while taking every sip. You get the sherry and fruits up front, in combination with a great sweet and sour thing going on with a hint of coastal salt (which I really think makes this whole dram pop!). All followed by the bourbon portion of the cask on the mid and rear palate where spices, brown sugar and vanilla creep in. It has a enough ABV to be extremely flavorful, and has a nice, rich, oily mouth experience. Highly recommend!

Final Score: 87/100
A very nice dram. Smells of a rich drinking chocolate to me.
It is the only Islay whisky I like, and it's awesome.
And if you can find it on sale it's amazing for it's price bracket!"

I think this is one of the best values for money left in scotch these days, along with Ardbeg 10, PC10, and Glendronach 12 (43% aside...)
Bunny is fantastic.  My go-to on Burns Night in Jan !
One of my faves
It is such a good pour for a basic 12 year old.

One of my favorite pours for an entry level whisky.

I had a similar review.  Smells like scotch.  Nice burn in the mouth.  Tongue tingling after the finish.  Yum.  As you can see I am a very sophisticated drinker /s  LOL  This is one of my favourites.  

&#x200B;

OK fine, your review gives a little more detail.
Great review! I’m still new at scotch, tried this one the other night and I think it will always have a place on my shelf!
I have this bottle as well and I am…. Not a fan. I’ve went through about half the bottle, always ready to give it another chance but there is a flavor in there I can’t quite put my finger on that I am unable to get passed when I sip it. I like the pepper that I find in it as well as black cherry and chocolate but on the whole is cones off as abrasive to me. I have other whiskies at and above this ABV so I believe this not to be the issue. Thus far it is the only Scotch I’ve tried that that I’ve had difficulty with.
Lol!
that burn goes away the more high ABV Scotch whiskies you drink :) after a longer affair with Scotland's best export you start thinking anything below 46% is watery and bland, so be careful :D
one of the better budget whiskies you can get from Scotland! good ABV, no artificial colour added, no chill filteration, a proper presentation focused on flavour without the corporate corner cutting :)
It’s so interesting how different peoples palates are!"
Review #19 - Booker’s - Bourbon,,https://i.redd.it/dexam5speyn91.jpg,"Review #19 - Bookers Batch 2022-1?** - 62.15% ABV

Nose: vanilla cupcake frosting, corn cobb, honey, cherry, oak

Palate: ethanol heat (in a good way), pepper, baking spices, oak, light charcoal, cherry, new leather and sweet corn. Medium mouthfeel

Finish: long finish. Tingle from ethanol, pepper, and baking spices remain prominent. Notes of charcoal and sweet corn pop through here and there. 

Final Thoughts: wow this has an amazing tongue sensation. You can feel a tingle at first, which turns into a thick warm blanket as it covers your palate. It really feels as if it warms your entire tongue, section by section, and then spreads throughout your head and chest unlike anything else I’ve tried before. This is a fantastic whiskey, right up my alley with bold flavors and a unique delivery. Only negative thing I could say is that for those who don’t like the ethanol heat up front, you may appreciate something more balanced or should you should add water, as Bookers could use a little something to offset the punch up front. But for me, it’s wonderful. At MSRP I highly recommend. 

Score: 88/100

**Disclaimer: I’m not 100% positive on the batch that I had on this one. I wrote this review a bit ago and didn’t get a chance to confirm on the bottle. I’m fairly certain it’s 2022-1, but could be wrong.
Great review! 2022 batches are crushing it! I’ve thoroughly enjoyed 22-01 and 22-02. Much better than 2021.
new leather, oak and heat were the few things I remember most, so it sounds right. 2022-01 Ronnie's 

Also, agree it could use just a touch of water. or drink it the way the original master distiller did,  with 1 cube of ice. 

I thought this was good, and then I tried 2022-02 lumberyard, and that was the next level up. still great taste and smoother, less of that initial heat, can go neat."

Review #18 - Glenfiddich 18 Year - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/qiycu2spayn91.jpg,"Review #18 - Glenfiddich 18 year - 43% ABV

Nose: Sweet oak, orange, cereal, hay, brown sugar, a little red wine cereal. The oloroso really pops out on the nose. 

Palate: sweet and sour right up front, a little hit of ethanol afterwards (but fairly balanced), followed by that sweet oak, orange, sultanas, and just a smidge of nut and pepper. Didn’t really get the oloroso on the palate. Medium to medium thick mouthfeel

Finish:  medium-long finish. Brown sugar, oak, pepper, and a little floral element that I can’t quite figure out

Final Thoughts: Glenfiddich 18 is a very unobtrusive and mild sipper. It’s got many great elements…sweet & sour, a little spice, a small kick from the ethanol, and a smooth oakiness. This would be a fantastic scotch for beginners that are not quite ready to dive into some bolder scotches, but still want a little bit more complexity than younger expressions or other more basic speysides.  For me, it’s a little too muted and missing some distinctiveness.  It’s what I would call “smooth”, but that is not what I am necessarily looking for in a scotch.  In short, awesome for those new to scotch, a little lacking for those further on in their journey.

I unashamedly love this stuff. I get tons of brown sugar on the palate.
> In short, awesome for those new to scotch, a little lacking for those further on in their journey

I felt the same about Glenmorangie 18! Super pleasant and approachable but missing ""depth and complexity""
It's strange, I've never had the 18, and the 12 was my ""go to"" for almost 2 decades. It just never seemed interesting enough as my finances improved as I got older XD
The 15 also comes in a higher proof distillery edition if you can find it. I picked mine up from travel retail.
Yes.  Especially if you really liked the 15 already.
[deleted]
I have Glenmo 18 on my bar right now, I blind bought it at a local store when it was on sale. And while I don't regret the purchase, you're correct it is not a complex whisky. It has been a while since I tasted it, but  I remember liking it and thinking it could have used another cask influence to add complexity.
Not that strange at all. I got this bottle as a gift. I probably wouldn’t buy the 18 year on my own even if finances permitted. Glen 12 is solid enough, and there are far more interesting drams than Glen 18 for the price…
I was lucky enough to have the 12 (best forgotten), the 15 and the 18 at a tasting with one of their ambassadors a few years ago. He asked what one I preferred and I sheepishly said the 15. He grinned and said that was his favourite as well though his bosses didn’t like him to ever say that.
The 12 is solid as heck. A half bottle of Glenfiddich 12 is STILL my standard housewarming gift 😁"

I have yet to try a better cognac. Glad you enjoyed it
Although your review is way more in depth than what I have in my notes for my Louis tasting, I had strong Concord grape and tobacco on my nose as well as most of what you listed here. Best liquor in general that I’ve ever tried.
There is a reason I keep a bottle on my bar at all times 🤌🏽
Low ABV? I thought 40% was standard, was it less or were you expecting more? Did you buy a whole bottle, by the way?
Nice 👍
Wow , amazing.
He should have given you the proper glass to drink out of. If you like this version you must try the Black Pearl. 🥰
outstanding review for an outstanding cognac, cheers!
And the price you paid is?
The thing about Louis XIII is that everyone’s palate is different! Mine was definitely a little different, more summer flavors and fruits over cinnamon and oak. My favorite cognac by far too.
I paid $150 for a 1.5oz pour one time. Lucky for me  I had a $200 hotel credit and I used it on that. The bartender was also very generous with the pour because he never had anybody order it before.
At the restaurant I go to its 1oz for $120! 
I went into a bar and saw they had Louis, and was heck, the wife isn't here, why not. I asked how much for a pour.

""$2,000.""

Me: ""What?!?""

""By tradition, the person who buys the last pour gets the container. That's Louis, the decanter is amazing. There's only one drink left. $2,000.""

Me: *mumbles* ""Remy XO, please...""
This is a genius way to use a hotel credit

Noted
That's cheap!!!! I see blue labels going for $60 a shot so for 3x the price you get Louie?!?!?!?

The hotel I stood at for my honeymoon this weekend had it at $200 for 0.5oz pour and $400 for 1oz and $800 for 2oz
$2k! Tf…

That last pour had probably been sitting there for ages so I imagine it wouldn't have been that great anyway.

Review #16 - Cles des Ducs VSOP - Armagnac,,https://i.redd.it/owp6xsw2onn91.jpg,"Review # 16 - Cles des Ducs VSOP - 40% ABV

Nose: cherry, vanilla, red orchard fruits, old books, nail polish remover

Palate: ethanol up front, medium thick mouthfeel, followed by leather, baking spices, and a little vanilla. I can tell other flavors are trying to pop out, but can’t  tell what they are due to the low ABV

Finish: medium-short finish that ends with a little heat from ethanol on the tongue, citrus (orange/lemon), and oak. 

Final Thoughts: My score on this is dramatically lowered because the heat really comes in hot for a low-ABV Armagnac. The flavor profile is great, but it is not balanced.

When you say 12 or 18 would you also recommend the 15yr old? Or skip it too?
15 is good if you like really sweet whisky with a strong cinnamon finish. I'm more of an Islay guy, so it didn't land with me as well as the 12 did. However, if you enjoy Highlands then you'll be more than happy with it.
As someone with a massive sweet tooth that sounds good!
I grabbed a dram to be a bit more specific. My breakdown of the 15 would be this, keep in mind I prefer whisky that is peated, and falls on the less sweet side of the flavour scale.

Nose: Very Sweet. Honey, and Vanilla Fudge are the standouts. Light smell of Dark Fruits and Oranges.

Palate: Very smooth. An insanely strong Sherry note that I find almost overpowering, Marzipan, Ginger, and Butterscotch and Raisins. Ends with cinnamon and spice.

Finish: Long and very rich. More Fruit, Raisins, and spice with a light hint of oak.

This whisky is a solid 6.5/10 from me. Gave it to my flat mate who loves Speyside and Highland whisky's and from him it's a 8.5/10.
I sound like your mate I think. That ticks just about every box I have!"

Good review! I had a very similar experience with this - tried it a long time after starting my whisky journey, and by that time, it was still good but a bit basic.
It's a simple malt that doesn't require much experience from the user. As such it works, even though I've not had a bottle in a couple of years."

Palate: sherry, leather, pepper, baking spices, ethanol. Medium-thick mouthfeel. I also get something that reminds me of sage

Finish: medium finish, pepper, oak, and ethanol

Final thoughts: whoa, a couple of drops of water really transforms this. Makes the flavors far more complex, adds a floral note, gives a thicker mouthfeel, and quells the heat a tad. Probably the best I’ve tried of the travel exclusive line (I liked Quest too, and Terra the least), but still has a long way to go to earn the price tags that you see on these bottles.

Well done for adding water which as usual, brings out a lot more flavour.
I dont think anyone is interested of Macallan now days since it is a real rip off
A finish tasting like ethanol ?

How would you know, have you ever tried drinking pure ethanol ?
I was also disappointed with the Terra, especially for the price. It was nice, just not “special”. Ignoring the price of the Enigma, do you think its a good enough whisky you would recommend it to a whisky fan?
Everclear.

“The 190-proof variant of Everclear is 92.4% ethanol by weight and is thus produced at approximately the practical limit of distillation purity.”
Pure Vodka in the EU is legally required to be “distilled so that the organoleptic characteristics of the raw materials used and by-products formed in fermentation are selectively reduced.”
Basically stating it needs be super pure with just ethanol left. It’s normally 96.4% ethanol with no other impurities, then you can add some flavours or dilute it down to minimum 37.5% abv with deionised water.

You can get the pure ethanol taste from a normal bottle of natural vodka (preferably wheat).
Not if you have to pay for it. Stick with the age statement stuff.
92% ethanol by weight? 

So the whiskey is 92% pure alcohol ?
Absolutely wild that the special editions are worse than the normal ones
It’s actually 95%. 190 proof.
That would sure keep the job done, but would it not taste absolute carbage though ?

The percentage on the box says 44,5%.
What? The ABV of the Macallan in this review is 44.5%

You asked how I know what ethanol tastes like. Everclear is what is 95% and basically straight ethanol."

Thanks for the review! Are you familiar with the old branding of Talisker before their refresh? Curious about everyone’s thoughts on this new looks, if you like it or not
It's solid, though it went up in price here last year, was 60-65, now it's like 80-85 in FL even at Total Wine. Think it was 80 at Costco also last time.

And yeah, woukd love to taste this as an Cask Strength variant and unfiltered.
When I had this bottle I drank it so quick I don't remember just how good it was. Guess I need to buy another.
I'd say the 57 North is like a Talisker 10 in cask strength (at least to me it was). But that one has been discontinued and remaining bottles' prices are ridicolous.
> Would love to try a cask strength, unchillfiltered expression of this.

Try and find the 15 year old Special Release from a couple years ago - it's pretty much Talisker 10 dialed up to 11.
Old was nicer imo. The new box/label is too bright and colorful
New look is cheap trash.
Its $45 where I live. Not rubbing it in, but its hard for me to not get a bottle everytime because I fee like thats such a good price.
I just recently scored a bottle for $60

I think it’s a good buy there, but the typical $80 I see it go for nowadays is not worth it imo. I would rather step up to corry or scoop up Ledaig 10 and pocket the extra.
I looked it up out of curiosity and found some online for €139. Does not seem too outrageous? Not sure what the original price was though
I think I agree, I’m assuming they went for something brighter to catch more attention in the aisle of a store
Ouch, for me
Oogie is 90+ now here so that my issue, so many bottles crept to 80+ and even Oogie used to be 65 but I still gladly pay the prices for Oogie now b/c Oogie 4 life!

The Benriach Smokey 10 was bang for the $. Was just under 60 here and I looooved that bottle, that profile was so good. But it's been out of stock for awhile :(
You could get it for around 60€ when it still was being produced. It's a nice malt (got it as a birthday present once) at that price, but there's no way it's worth 139€. I'd say 60-70€ max.
The colour scheme now is pretentious and cheapens the look considerably.
damn ok clearly I need to grab oogie too. I found corry for $80 flat and it’s been wonderful. Other scores were Springbank 10 for $67 and Laga 16 for $75! 

I think I’m between Oogie and PC10 for the next bottle unless a really irresistible deal for Clynelish 14 pops up
You went to the dollar sale? Those are not normal prices. Springbank 10 is usually $80-$100 and Laga/corry $100.
hell yeah, i call it my scotch trip

Total wine near me has pretty attractive prices normally too though. Corry is $90 and talisker 10 is $70, clynelish 14 is $74, etc

Oogie is $70, might just need to do that"

Thanks for the great review. My first smokey Scotch. Was thinking about buying another and will take your review as a sign. $80 here in Bama.
excellent choice, very good review, and (imao) about the highest quality/price ratio
Almost grabbed this a couple days ago but opted for Rare Breed rye instead. Almost regret my decision. Thanks for the review!
This and Oban 14 are two I always have a bottle of.
I love talisker 18, how does the 10 compare?
I like this bottle but I find the finish a bit ashy compared to ardbeg or port charlottes 10 year offerings.
This one is on my wishlist for a while now. Reading your review gives me more reasons to buy it
[deleted]
I always get some sort of chocolate or coffee note in there with Talisker too, especially if I let it rest. There's an earthy quality to it, including the peat. Less medicinal than Laphroaig, not as dry as Ardbeg or Ledaig. Ballechin, the peated Edradour, has similar qualities and comes in some cask strength variants in independent bottlings.
[deleted]
The 18 is more mellow, I'd describe the brine and smokiness as more refined, even elegant. The 10 is very well rounded, but brasher and doesn't have the sherry influence, making it a little less complex. Talisker is my favorite distillery and I keep bottle on the shelf. 

If you haven't tried already, the Talisker Distillers Edition is the best value in their core range in my opinion.
It way more like a Highland park 12 with a tiny dash of Laphroiag on top. VERY muted.
Yeah I don’t really know what I’m doing and wanted to try a new scotch and got laphroaig 10. I was pretty surprised by that. I don’t hate it but it just wasn’t what I expected, maybe I’d like this one idk.
LOL Thanks for the correction. You are exactly right. I wrote Governor MeMaw this morning complaining about the ABC Board and our high prices.

Yeah the only other scotches I’ve had (that I can actually remember what they taste like) were glenfiddich 14 and monkey shoulder. I loved the glenfiddich and thought it would be similar but I’m dumb
She's an elderly grey/white headed woman that looks like your grandmother.  In her case it's not exactly a term of affection.
Highland Park 12 might be a good purchase. It's got just the slightest bit of smokiness to it. Less so than Talisker."

Review #10 - NYAK VS - Cognac,,https://i.redd.it/i0y63bck9ei91.jpg,"Review #10 - NYAK VS - 40% ABV

Nose: sugarcane, rum, hint of dark grapes

Palate: brown sugar/caramel, too much sugar, floral notes, oak, light spice, oh and more sugar

Finish: medium length finish, slight ethanol and heavy sugar

Final Thoughts: wayyy too sugary. Just wow. Drinking this neat tastes like a younger version of Hennessy VS with a whole handful of sugar cubes dropped in the glass. If you’re into sugary, 40% Cognac, this is for you. It may be decent as a mixer (again if you like sugary), but even then I’d probably choose something else 9 times out of 10. Im sure the company is full of wonderful and hard working people, and I’m sure this cognac probably has its following…but for me, I’ll look elsewhere. It was worth a try to know it’s not for me.

Darn. 

Always looking for opinions on stuff I can get bonus TW points on.
nyak nyak nyak!
Thanks for the review. Whereas it doesn't seem to be your intent to recommend, all I want to do now is TASTE IT FOR MYSELF. Gosh darnit, you got me. Going out now!
But seriously, with the sugar content you've mentioned I'd imagine it'll ""sit"" heavy like a syrup or liqueur. Is that the case or nah. Density of this compared to I suppose Hennessey as you mentioned?
It sits a little heavy. But not like a liqueur. 

I’d recommend getting something from a smaller family cognac house (not the big houses) like Pasquet, Guillon-Paintaraud, Fillioux, Vallein-Tercinier, Grosperrin, Frapin, Navarre, etc."
Review #9 - Redemption High Rye - Bourbon,,https://i.redd.it/f3jk9ko98ei91.jpg,"Review #9 - Redemption High Rye Bourbon - 46% ABV

Nose: maple syrup, sandalwood, oak, spice

Palate: vanilla, straight heat, spice, light oak, thin mouthfeel

Finish: keeps a burn and tingle on the tongue, remaining ethanol and oak, short finish

Final Thoughts: This bourbon definitely tastes like it’s young age.  It’s nose is better than palate, and the palate remains unrefined and quite simple. It’s a fine mediocre whiskey, and I might recommend here and there as a mixer. But for me, this would be a hard pass most of time.  

Score: 63/100
I know that this bottle has a following, but it was an absolute drain pour.
Never had this one, the Redemption Sib at 105 proof was alright to me, sweet nothing astringent, but not complex or anything.
I've thought about buying this multiple times and glad I did not.   Also it is MGP.   I'm not on a MGP kick so glad I didn't buy it.    Sorry you had to go through the experience.
I don’t mind MGP at all.  I’m actually a big fan of a number of MGP-based products. This is just not one of them…
Try to find a store pick of this. They’re fantastic at the higher proof.
I've been searching high and low for the 9 year barrel proof bourbon. Finally found a bottle at $120. The barrel select high rye for around $55. Maybe I'll save myself $70.
100% agree. For around $50 they are tasty."

Nose: Red Grape Skins, Cherries, Brown Sugar, Oak, hint of grape jolly ranchers

Palate: Spices, pepper, oak, orchard fruits, with a little clover honey and the slightest heat. Medium thin mouthfeel.

Finish: Oak and fall spices remain on the palate, brown sugar reappears, a bit of saltiness that almost reminds me of some brine from a good, coastal scotch. 

Final Thoughts: First, I will start by saying this is a great cognac. Frapin really knows what they are doing, and it shows in the balance of this XO. Even at 41%, it does have a little heat, but they did a good job at leveling that out with the sweetness and spice. This is a great entry into the higher end, family-owned cognacs. However, the potential of this cognac is seriously held back. This cognac at a higher ABV (46%+), with no chill filtration or coloring would put it on a whole new level. I would love to see a brut de fût version of this. If Frapin is listening, please give us a cask strength, unchillfiltered, natural color version!!!

Thanks for the review! Not sure if something is up with my algorithm but i feel like i dont see as many reviews on this sub as i do on other alcohol subs. Maybe they just have more people but it think its also just a lot of people on here that i see are asking aboutprices and reselling and such.
My understanding is that there is no added color to this, FWIW. I do agree that a higher proof, unfiltered bottling would be awesome.

There are some cool Frapin releases coming up in the near future, however, including something at near-cask strength."
Review #7 - Glencadam 15 year - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/qiin9jnxhte91.jpg,"Review #7 - Glencadam 15 Year - 46% ABV

Nose: Apple orchard/light cider, wax, “fresh air scent”

Palate: Hay, green apple jolly rancher, pepper, slight grassy, floral, and oaky notes as well. Medium mouthfeel with slight ethanol heat on the back end. Water really brings out the fruits on this one. 

Finish: Medium-short finish. Pepper, spice and apple peels linger slightly. 

Final thoughts: Glencadam is a quality dram. It’s not pretentious, delivers where it’s needed, and is an enjoyable sipper. As you will see many others say, water really transforms this scotch, and brightens up the flavors with more fruit and flower notes. That said, this is not my favorite flavor profile. The flavor is more subtle, and although very very good, is a little one note for my preference. It’s definitely a good option for those new to scotch, or for those who really enjoy mild highland flavors. It was $95 USD where I purchased it, and although a good dram, I would not pay that amount again for it. Price brings down the score for me a couple of points. 

Score: 77/100
Sorry to say, but I bought this and it is a huge disappointment. Drinks more like a 12 year Irish whiskey than a $90 single malt scotch. Fresh fruit, apple, sour/sweet, and no sign of the 15 years in the barrel.
Thanks for the review! I agree at that price it’s probably not worth a rebuy. And this one really seems to fluctuate in price place to place. I’ve seen it go anywhere from 70-100. At the low end I think it’s a good value buy, at the high end not so much. 

But either way I think it’s a great summer dram because of its light flavor profile.
Thanks for posting a review.

Since you knocked this dram down a few points based on the price, is there another less expensive scotch which you would recommend that does a fair job of representing this flavor profile, but at a lower price? Or do you feel that this flavor profile does not compete well with other styles of scotch that you prefer better, when shopping in this price range?

Cheers
Seconded. Great for summer!
I know I’m not the original poster,  but the glencadam 13 is another very enjoyable and respectable dram that has similar profile that is usually $10-20 cheaper.  Arran 10 I think has a similar profile and is cheaper."

Great review.  I tried this recently,  and even at 99$ where I am, I bought a second bottle.  This one is right up my alley! Bourbon matured, sweet and sour,  and it has that kind of waxy clynelish thing going on. Really good, possibly overlooked whisky.
I opened up a bottle of this last night.  Also right up my street. A bit more of a grown up version of the 10 (which I also like). I get toffee'd orchard fruits and peachy/apricot tones with some pepper. Understated and very drinkable were my first impressions. I paid £57 so about $70 US. For me it represents good value and I'd buy again. Also agree with the OP that it is a good whisky for those starting out."

Nose: Pickle juice, seaweed, brine, light peat, vanilla

Palate: Sweet and sour sauce, pickle juice, brine/sea salt, white pepper, very light oak. Medium mouthfeel, low heat and quite balanced

Finish: Medium finish, notes remain of that vinegar portion of the pickle juice, vanilla, ginger, grapefruit rind, and very slight ethanol

Final Thoughts:  I’ve heard many people say that they think Oban is kind of one note and not that memorable. Although I think Oban is one of the less palate punching distilleries, I do think it’s flavor is quite distinctive, memorable, and just nice. It’s not going to blow your socks off, but it will definitely make you nod thinking that this is a decent dram, with some underlying complexity and great coastal notes.  It’s potential is definitely limited by the lower ABV at 43%, and I get the feeling that at cask strength Oban is much more unique in delivering that sweet & sour, briney, pickle juice. If you haven’t tried it before, it’s definitely worth a try. Quality whiskey, but underutilizing it’s potential with low ABV and chill filtration.

Mine always looks like this. Convinced I have a leaky bottle.
It’s a staple bottle for me. It reaches across a variety of flavour profiles which should be accessible to many scotch drinkers .
IMO It’s one of the few Scotches that everyone likes.
This was my first single malt purchase. 
$65 at Costco in San Diego. 

This bottle really opened up to me at half full. 
It will be a staple on my shelf.
Funny, I just pulled this bottle out a few days ago since a friend of mine is headed there.  Reminded me how much I enjoy it--it's certainly on the lighter end, but there's enough interesting flavor going on to satisfy.
That’s a really nice whisky, Enjoy bud"

Although I don't think I have ever had Oban 14 I definitely share your opinion about low ABV chillfiltered scotches. There's an ocean of low ABV chillfiltered scotches that I am sure would be excellent if bottled at 48% and non chillfiltered.

What Glenlivet did when they produced the 12yr ""Illicit Still"" is fabulous. Compared to the core range 12yr you see the similarities but the difference that proper ABV and non chillfiltered makes is phenomenal.

I can't afford to pay for the low ABV chillfiltered scotches only to wonder what if they were 48% and non chillfiltered but I do find reviews such as yours interesting ""what if?"" You could ask that question alot....

Thanks for sharing.
Despite the 43% this was my gateway Scotch and will always hold a spot in my heart and shelf.  I’m glad I’ve never gotten the pickle juice or sweet and sour notes however. I’m not a fan of those flavors. I agree 100% with the brine, I get a plum or dark fruit note with it. That combination keeps me coming back.
Agree with this review. So much potential but 43% and chill filtered makes this is shadow of how great could be.
A favorite!  I keep one in the stable.
I am on the same boat.
Lower ABV stuff can be amazing but I really hate wondering ""What it would have been at higher ABV""."

Final Thoughts: I am a huge fan of Valentine Distillery and what they are trying to do as a micro distillery focusing on quality above all else. This Rye is a combination of their own in-house distillate and MGP juice as they build their longer-term distillate stocks to eventually transition over to their own distillate completely. I am sure the taste on this will change over time, but am confident that their team will continue to crank out great spirits. As a whole, this is a great catch-all rye, great neat or as a mixer, but does show some youth. High quality for a fair price point. Valentine is not readily available in most areas, but if you can get your hands on it, I highly recommend. Great rye!

Review #3 - Laphroaig 10 year - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/idksz87dwb891.jpg,"Laphroaig 10 year - 43% ABV

Nose: Smoke, Campfire, Bactene Antiseptic Spray, Peat, Earth, Iodine, Light Wood

Palate: Smoke, Charred Wood, Old Peat, Cereal, Hint of honey or something sweet, then returns to smoke and iodine

Finish: Medium Finish, leaves a strong taste of campfire in your mouth, but also balanced with a subtle sweetness that comes through the smoke. 

Final Thoughts: Laphroaig is for sure one of those polarizing drinks. You either love it, or you hate it. For me, it’s fantastic. It smells and tastes like someone bottled up the smoke from the fire in Hagrid’s hut, but in the best way possible. Once you get beyond the smoke, the flavors of the scotch really come through, and are extremely well balanced.  In the past, Laphroaig was one of those gateway drinks for me. When I first tried it, I hated it, but was so impressed by how much flavor could be packed into a sip, that I continued to come back to it until I absolutely fell in love. Laphroaig 10 is a drink I will always have on hand for when I’m feeling like a dram’s dram. 

Score: 79/100

P.S. Posting this on my cake day. Love all you redditors!
Honestly, Laphroaig 10 is probably the best scotch in terms of value for money. I don't know a single other scotch I enjoy as much at the same sub 35€ price point. Maybe Caol Ila 12 as well to be honest.
It's between Laphroaig 10 and Ardbeg 10 for me. I go back and forth, but usually end up with the Laphroaig.
I bought a bottle of Laphroaig 10 on accident. Got home and WTF!?!?!? Hated it. It took me about 6 months to drink it because I don't like to waste booze but once I was done, I really enjoyed it. I hated peat at first but now I love it and always have a bottle of the 10 on my shelf.
Literally the grossest thing I've ever put in my mouth is Laphroaig 10...and I was in college  for 6 years.
I enjoy this stuff a lot. Not only do I think it’s delicious, but the name is fun to say too 😀
Just opened by bottle tonight. I’m not experienced in describing whisky but agree with the honey notes. I had only ever gotten smoke from it before when I was at a bar but at home I took my time trying to figure it out.
I enjoy the Ardbeg 10 a little more as a direct comparison, but the Laphroaig Quarter Cask is fantastic. It had a briny flavour under the peat that I really, really liked.
95/100
Talisker 10, as I can get it for 20-25€ sometimes.
I disagree, Talisker 10, ardbeg 10, ledaig 10 are much better bang for your buck when it comes to smokey scotch.
I prefer Ardbeg 10 over Laphroaig 10, but I prefer Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength over anything Ardbeg I've tried so far.
This^
You have to get used to it. If you like peat, can't go wrong with it.
Finally someone said it

Absolutely disgusting 🤢
Haven’t had the quarter cask yet. Was wondering how It compared. Love that briney flavor, so I may have to try it.
I dunno where you're based, but in my country Ardbeg 10 and Ledaig 10 are between 50 and 60€ while Lephroaig 10 and Caol Ils 12 are usually around 30, max 35€
Hmm, haven't tried the cask strength. I'll have to give it a go
It's the iodine that gets me.
I bought deals over here. Got Talisker 10 for 21€, ardbeg and ledaig for around 35€. Laphroig 10 I never bought again after the first bottle. But overall I see them as same class of prices, besides ledaig which went up in price recently after a famous youtuber rated it high:/
Lol my bartender friend poured me a taster and we shared it. Neither of us considered it even patable then. A month later, I tried pranking my mom and had him pour one for her. She thought it was disgusting but I wasn't gonna let it go to waste, so I finished the glass but this time I found it a lot more interesting than the first time. Still wouldn't even consider buying a bottle though. Idk, I might be coming around.
I love the iodine flavour in Talisker 10 but the Laphroaig has a real petroleum flavour to it that doesn’t do it for me. Maybe it’ll grow on me. 
It is intense, I’ll give it that.
Agreed on the Talisker. Laphroiag 10 is the only single malt in my local pub, so I’ll drink it there, but it’s the Talisker I’ll keep a bottle of in the house. Or Ledaig; still smoky, but less medicinal."

Great review. If you enjoyed this, I would strongly recommend buying some laphroaig 10 cask strength. There is a different batch each year, however they are all genuinely brilliant.
It's possibly the most masculine drink i've ever drank. 

I am definitely a fan. I also agree it's not for everyone. Cheers.

Review #2 - Abelour A’bunadh - Batch 71 - Scotch,,https://i.redd.it/qtqqyg5z1o791.jpg,"Abelour A’bunadh - Batch 71 - 61.5% ABV

Nose: Ethanol, Nail Polish Remover, Sherry, Red Wine, Honeydew Melon, Light floral bouquet

Palate: Heat right off the bat, sherry, light oak, maple syrup, ethanol, cherry, mild spices

Finish: medium long finish, heat. Leaves both good taste of sherry and hot ethanol.

Final thoughts:  I know there are a ton of A’bunadh lovers out there, and I was really hoping to be one of them. I had heard nothing but great things for this sherry bomb, but I was disappointed. You can really tell that there is some young whiskey in here completely throwing off the balance of this dram. It definitely improved after adding some water and letting the bottle open up after a month or two. As this is the only batch I have tried, I have no basis of comparison for other batches, and am assuming there have been some way better batches. All I can say is that I am not impressed.  I appreciate what it is attempting to do, but was expecting better execution for almost $100 USD per bottle. 

Score: 62/100
I had a couple bottles before this, don’t remember the batch numbers, but I really enjoyed them. Just cracked open 71 and was very disappointed. Way harsher and less flavorful. Hoping this isn’t a trend for the brand.
I’m with you, OP. This is one of my least favourite whiskies and that’s after trying many batches. Your notes are spot on. Young, hot, unbalanced and one note. It’s not for me.
Try batch 70. May be more up your alley. I saw 71 today almost pulled the trigger, but I’m sure it’ll be there next time.
I’ve had batches 50, 67, 68, 69 and 71 and 71 was not as good as the others. 68 was my favorite as I found the high abv offset by its richness. 71 was how you described it. You will see many reviews pointing out the inconsistencies between batches so don’t give up on it. When it’s good it is very good. Good luck.
I thought I was the only one. Paid €65,- for it and that's way overpriced in my opinion. I honestly think Glenfarclas 105 is better (at €40,-). But then again, this might be a bad batch (tried #71 as well).
I've only had batch 50 but I loved it. I guess the newer batches aren't worth trying.
Yea, if I can get a sample of a couple other batches I would try them. Otherwise, I’ll probably pass on buying another bottle for awhile.
Thanks for giving me a glimmer of hope!
I think the underlying distillate of Aberlour is a bit bland and bready when I've had ex-bourbon examples.  Glenfarclas is definitely more interesting on that front though they seem to go for a more savory style of sherry cask to complement the toasted ceareal notes of their distillate.
It does depend on your tastes. I got a guy dissing me whilst comparing Balvenie to Islays in another thread. So personal tastes matter. I don’t have any mini to bottle up any 70 to send to you! But I would.
I felt the same way about batch 70…it’s just not good. Young, hot, sulphury, unbalanced. Way too expensive. Much better out there. This might have been good once but not now.
Haha appreciate it bro!  Haters gonna hate"

I've been enjoying a bottle of batch 69 this evening. I'm more of a bourbon and Irish SPS fan, and to be honest, I have had a hard time finding single malts that I truly enjoy. This is one of them. The sherry influence is enough to take the sting out of the high proof, but not overbearing. The cereal note of the  malted barley, which is not my favorite flavor profile, is balanced with the fruit and ethanol. I can understand why some Scotch lovers wouldn't necessarily love this dram, but if you're into high proof American whiskey, this might be a whisky you'll adore.
The 71 was the only one available to me here in control Bama and I didn't care for it much either. I do plan on trying others though.
Seems like you just struggled with the high proof
I've tried 3 batches. Fifty something, 64, 71.

In my opinion, or maybe my memory is not accurate.

I felt that it is getting worse.

I do not like batch71
I found a bottle of batch 65 recently. I really enjoy aberlour 12 and was hoping this would just ramp up those flavors. I too was disappointed and agree that there is very young whiskey in there that just throws everything off. It’s not terrible but not what I was wanting or expecting."

Review #1 - L’Encantada XO - Lot 3.0 - Armagnac,,https://i.redd.it/cnpajr840i691.jpg,Thanks for the review. Would you like flair?
Review #1 - L’Encantada XO - Lot 3.0 - Armagnac,,https://i.redd.it/cnpajr840i691.jpg,"L’Encantada XO - Lot 3.0 - Bottled by PM Spirits - ABV 44.9%

Nose: Maple syrup, pancakes, caramel, red grapes, cherries, varnish, hint of leather 

Palate: Caramel, oak, grapes, plum, clove, light spices

Finish: Medium length finish, sandalwood, slight heat on the rear palate, getting a lingering hint of developing rancio 

Final thoughts: I thought this was an absolutely lovely blend of armagnacs. The syrupy nose was absolutely fantastic, and was followed by a pretty good balance of oak, fruit, and spice, though the heat would creep in from time to time.  Though there are others I’d drink over this, I would buy it again to have in my cellar knowing it is a reliable, high-quality dram that won’t disappoint. 

Score: 83/100
4.0 coming soon!
I’ve had this and lot 2, and both struck me as having 10/10 noses but a palate and finish that couldn’t quite live up to the nose. That isn’t to say they both aren’t delicious, I liked both quite a bit, but the nose on each is def the standout. Really rich, nutty, fruity and floral for me.

Edit: forgot to say, nice review!
Great review!

Considering grabbing this soon so it's timely. Have you had any other batches?
Where’d you get it?
Thank you!  Agreed. Nose smells like straight dessert
I own 3.0 and each time I return to it I go through this exact experience. While the flavors present are lovely, they are far too fleeting, with a mouthfeel that is slightly too thin and a finish that is too short. This is like listening to Led Zeppelin with the volume turned down.
Thank you! 

No, haven’t had any other of the batches.  Though after trying this, I would love to.
So I'm at specialist bar that had this on hand (I have an order planned for Lot 4.0). I gotta say your notes are spot-on!

Super syrupy and rich. I'm having it alongside the Darroze Tucom 2002 (more of an oak-coffee bomb). They're both good but the L'encantada has more going on"

Dividend on Cost question,"Hey dividend lovers, I have a question regarding dividend on cost for ETFs.  One of the main reasons I love dividend stocks is after years of holding (assuming company continues to raise it's dividends) the dividend on cost can grant crazy returns.

However, my question is how does this work with dividend ETFs such as SCHD or VYM?  

Do the same dividend on cost compounding effects happen within an ETF structure?  

If the ETF is rebalancing based upon market weights and buying/selling over the years, wouldn't this negate some of the dividend on cost aspects?

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ueo1sc/dividend_on_cost_question/,"Welcome to r/dividends!

It should accumulate in the same way, only you get the average of all the assets in the etf.

Look at an etf like a total portfolio, in essence that is what it is. Yield on cost grows like you would have bought the individual stocks yourself.
ETFs do not possess the historical data of dividend increases compared to individual stocks.
You do realize that yield on cost is a historical metric measuring how well your investment did based on the original cost and subsequent dividend increases but is not an indication of true return?  It does not tell you what your stock is yielding in income or capital appreciation."

What riggs......does that actually pay for the power it takes to run your rigs?
How. I have do you have?
Cool. Which pool pays in Doge instead of LTC?

Also, I hope you’re mining to a ‘proper’ wallet. IE, not a lite client or third-party service?
Nice......
A few Antminer L3++ and a few MiniDoge miners. And yes, it pays for electricity (which I even pay an extra premium for to get wind and solar) and then some…
F2pool does merged mining. So when you mine LTC, you can mine doge simultaneously and get the doge payout. 

And yes, it's going to a proper wallet :)
![gif](giphy|3o84sq21TxDH6PyYms)
All LTC pools merge mine Doge and a handful of others.

So do they pay you all the coins separately, or do they convert everything to Doge? Because if it’s the latter, you probably don’t want to do that, as it’s costing you.

They pay coins separately. I get both doge and LTC

True
Everyone’s trying to make “the next Dogecoin” that goes from fractions of a penny to $0.75. Instead of just investing in Dogecoin itself.
That also tells us how POWERFUL Dogecoin is and also how much potential it has if turds want to destroy it. Just like everything in life that is good, you have to protect it. Turds will try to ruin and stink up anything shiny including people places or things.

Nothing to fear but being stupid and selling at a loss!  
Don’t sell and you don’t lose anything.   
But if you want to use this crash to help your position then you can sell and buy it right back, now you can claim the loss on your taxes but you need to do it wile we are low. When it goes back up the amount of loss is going to be smaller.    
To maximize the amount you can claim do this first before new year second on a dip and just buy right back or if you believe it’s going down then watch it.  
But it’s a simple way to recoup some of the losses and stay whole and not lose anything.
Let people make their decissions. What I personally hate is when people keep saying doge is doing good, while DOGE/BTC price steadily drops for the last 6 months (yeah, this is important to understand how doge is doing, not DOGE/USD really). It’s the lowest it was in these 6 months. Doge was doing good. I think Doge will get to 1$, but where will coins like ETH be at this point? If someone wants to take their money out, let them. Just remember. Some people who took their money out in some dip 3 months ago were also criticized right after the dip. If then they put that money in BTC or ETH, do you think they were dumb for selling DOGE? Spreading FUD is smarter than spreading positive misinformation. Let people reinvest their money if they want. Btw I’m all in Doge, but I just kind of don’t care anymore as it’s not worth a lot now. Now obviously I wish I did move to ETH a few months ago, but I didn’t know what will happen with any of the coins, just as you (or I or anyone else) doesn’t know now.

Another doge miner up and running for you fellow shibes!,,https://i.redd.it/9hiismkx59w71.jpg,"How much that joker make a day?
The real question is how can I get my hands on this device ASAP
I can hear this running over the internet
20 something doge
Ebay or Newegg. These were all made in 2017 so you have to buy them used
So like $6 @ $0.30 a coin. 

Love it. Kind of wish I would have went that route at times. 

I see a future in DOGE so long term would have been. 

Whats 1 of those cost Brand New? $1,500 right?
Let's say the Doge price averages 0.25 and you mine 20 coins, 5 dollars a day, 150 dollars a month. Then the device would pay for itself in about 9 months add another month for electric cost. Of course, the enjoyment of doing it adds to the value I feel.
You can only get them used. About $1200-1500. They were only made In 2017"
New Dogecoin Mining Rig Arrived! Such Beauty. Much wow.,,https://i.redd.it/3z9crub5v7u71.jpg,"Where does one aquire such beauty?
How much you pay on electricity cuz I thinking and buy a couple many of those mining things
How does mining work, and how many coins do you actually acquire
Oh how cool!!! Much success!!!! Go get those coins!
That's pretty cool 👍😎
Where can I find info on how to set something like this up?
She’s a beaut!
Whats the return a day on those kinds of kit?
But from what Vitalik Buterin said on twitter, hoping that Dogecoin will have its consensus mechanism move from proof of work to proof of stake, is it still worth it it to buy a dogecoin miner?
So cool
For how much
Litecoin mining rig, you mean.
does this actually pay for itself?
How much time it will take to recover that money
How does one get into mining? Read about some damn kids doing this and getting rich!!!
Super wow. Me much jello
How much are they?
Much BowWow!
Where do you get something like that???
How much does it mine per day? I don’t know how these things work

And what’s the price of this mining rig?
Newegg
It's....14k
Same thoughts.
They are ASIC’s, from my experience they run at anywhere between 800-1350 watts. I’m no expert but I will suggest doing research on ASIC mining before jumping head first into it.
You bury it in your backyard and it mines the dogecoin from the Earth /s
In terms of mining in general or mining Dogecoin?

I’m not the best at explaining Proof of Work (POW) or “mining” but there are better explanations out there. :)

The amount of coins you get depends on your hashrate, if you are in a mining pool or solo mining. For Dogecoin the block reward is 10,000 Doge, but this is most likely not what you are going to be making if you run a small amount of rigs. (Due to the competitive nature of cryptocurrency mining.)
It’s pretty easy.

Step one: Take out a second mortgage.
They are like 15k. If you got that laying around go ahead lol
2 quid
With the current difficulty it's about 7.5 Doge and .004 Ltc a day.
if you live with your mom and she pays for the electic and air conditioning
about $1300

Although other people are quoting around $700 so i dont know where they are getting them
Oh lawd.
The mini is $700.00(from GS). The L7 is what I think ur talking about.✌️
Mini Doge uses 233 watts. At 10 cents a kwh your looking at 56 cents a day to run.
This is one of goldshell mini boxes, they are built to be cheap and don’t use that much electricity, for non professional miners

The mini doge runs on 150w on low power mode (230 on the max settings if I’m not mistaken) - I have one running on my office 24/7 with no real change on my electric bill
![gif](giphy|1iqPjXVRQsWArYs7a0)
To that's a good thing because all form of power is predicted to go up 50 percent this winter. Electric, oil, natural Gas, propane.🥶
They cost 699 USD wtf you talking about
Damn not enough for a tesco meal deal.
They're getting them from the manufacturer. They drop occasionally but go the way of gpu's.
Ye. Takes money to make money
ah so you say this is not L7 ... so what make/model is it?
They make like 7.5 Doge a day, so electricity per box is easily covered and you only have to eat through your investment to net positive which would take about 2 years, assuming the price is the same.
Oh cool, I haven’t seen any ASIC’s like this in a while that’s why I jumped to conclusions.
Not even gonna take the time to explain something like this if you don’t understand.
Nope, maybe you can get one kebab a week
Every damn day bro.
Goldshell ""Mini *DOGE*.
The one shown here is only $700. But there are models around 15k
I have 2 of them running on my office bought on different batches straight from the manufacturer 

Maybe they are just dumb and forgot to add a few zeros on my invoice am I right? You should email them to fix that

Yeah, don't know what OP was thinking. For the sea, orcas are the apex predator. If sharks hear orcas are around they will leave the area alone for years. And for land it is unquestionably humans. We have killed all large land animals to extinction and the medium ones are around because we want them to be.

So maybe the point is that Dogecoin is around because people using better currencies like Monero want them to be?

Wait. I don't follow NASCAR. Is there actually Dogecoin car?
That's dogecoin Lambo?
I keep submitting a suggestion that UPS should put big red noses on their brown trucks in the winter because they are a legit Rudolph delivering our gifts. They haven't responded so far but I know I will see it one day in my life.
Hi
Let’s stop this meme stuff and gets serious about Dogecoin
It needs to make
Money not be a game
Any longer
You could just talk to your local delivery guy and just make him a red nose to place on his truck. Something that is easy to put on and off because if I am not mistaken, they don't use the same truck everyday.
So you're into it for the money? That's against dogecoin rules..
That's a good idea. My local guy is at my house nearly every day and he's super awesome. Maybe that would get the ball rolling for the other trucks too. I'll make one with a magnetic mount so he can remove it/switch trucks very easily. That's also important since I believe they wash the trucks quite frequently.
Hey I do what I want with my money 
WhAt else is crypto for?
If you're not in it for the money, what's the purpose of the investment. Then it's a joke and so are those who only put out memes and say ""you shouldn't be in it for the money@.  Those people are compete morons and part of the problem. Those people need to go away and play Pokémon, or read Harry Potter books and let this thing thrive with real investors and strategic minded people like every other bit coins

Why have dogecoins, if not to make money?  Just to have them?
to watch it tank?
I mean the history of the coin was a meme and a way for people to learn crypto/tip with low stakes. Has been that way for years. 

Now people think there is an opportunity and want to lick the old guard out, which is difficult when they don't actually care about it making money.
No BTC didn’t tank
You hit it on the head....they don't care about it marking money. 1. There is no limit or cap. 2.  They hasn't been a real software update in years. 3. There is no one really in charge, the inventor bailed. 
Things needs to change. These Pokémon / Harry Potter posters need to go away for it ever to have a chance. If you're into for the money..""that's against the rules"", or it's not the right mindset to have

These people are a joke and are part of the problem of dogecoin not progressing
it did after \*I\* bought it.
I'm not investing, I have always just followed the community.

I suggest you look elsewhere for investment opportunity because the people without the right mindset are not really going to leave. The coin does not ""need"" to evolve or make money it was never intended to do that.
1. No limit or cap is not necessarily a bad thing.

2. There are ongoing updates all the time. Please use facts if you're going to try to make erroneous claims.

3. Again, false. There is an active core development team working on the project. The creator handed it off to them. They are extremely dedicated to doge.  

Please stop spreading misinformation.
Then wait for it to go up, sell half. Wait for it go back down, buy it back. Repeat.
A cap is needed to effect and drive value. You have no idea about market analysis or economics. 

Additionally, my assessment on updates is correct. It is not mis information

And if you don't like what I say, don't read it or listen. I won't be silenced on what is really going on. Go back to your Harry Potter books moron
What are the names of those on the development team. It should be public knowledge if it existed. It doesn't. Stop dreaming 

Even Elon musk bailed and endorsed someone else.
Sounds easier said than done. So what part of the roller coaster is it currently on, the dip or the rise?
I guess it depends on your time horizon. If you're trading intraday it looks like it's heading down. I'd buy when the MACD shows a reserval if the RSI is below 40. If you're swing trading you can probably buy now and look for a rise in 3-4 days."

What Dogecoin has to focus on right now is how to reach more people worldwide, to increase public awareness. That begins with Coinbase, being part of their exchange platform. It would not surprise Doge longtime holders if that happens by the end of the year, or early 2021. Like all companies the bottom line dictates their path forward, reducing the listing requirements would do a lot to increase net profits

At the same time Dogecoin has to promote itself. Developers, or some other representative chosen have to begin conversations with the media, from the written press to financial television programs, discussing the core qualities of Doge, its future in a cryptocurrency world.

Many on this subreddit may disagree in self promotion, would prefer Dogecoin remain quietly on the sidelines, waiting for its core values to propel it to a the top tier of cryptocurrencies. I respectfully disagree.

Dogecoin takes money and moves it, fungibly, from point A to point B in about a minute for a 3rd of a penny and has been doing it, daily, since 2013.

What is the dream for Dogecoin holders, what do they foresee happening? 

Blockchain Cryptocurrencies are evolving, almost minute by minute. Dogecoin holders believe that solid fundamentals along with a strong vibrant community will eventually propel Doge to the top tier of crypto coins, positioned to battle for the honour of becoming an essential global monetary player. It’s all initiated with a major surge, not one instigated by pump and dump manipulation, but because of Dogecoin’s core strengths. With that increased confidence by populations across the globe, its position solidified, Doge can now prepare for the final push, becoming an essential part of the monetary system. 

Dogecoin’s role is multifaceted, but perhaps it’s most important achievement will be to rectify Fiat’s failures, bringing the hundreds of millions disenfranchised into the global economy, giving them an opportunity to enjoy the riches that the world has to offer.

No need to explain. It is so clear, dogecoin is dogecoin.
hiding its beauty that's about doge
And you have to pay an obscene amount of money to move him
One is successfully gaining in value, and the other is worthless because it has an endless supply which doesn't allow for increased valuation.
Looks like her knee is bent.
Just remember...the US dollar also has an endless supply...  A cap is not everything.
The US dollar is based on a fascist government saying it has value
Um. Not even close.  The dollar is backed by securities and gold, and in a complex supply chain market. In cryptocurrency, a coped supply IS everything. Straight economics.
The dollar hasn't been backed by gold for 50 years.
Correct, but they are required to have a set amount in reserve. But you are completely missing the point. You are trying to a complex system like that US and economy to a small crypto currency, which has an endless supply, not allowing for price increase, and tied to an inflationary model, which in itself, prevents price valuation increases.   This is pointless, because your argument is based upon emotion, and not logical economical thinking.
No, my argument is based on actually viewing dogecoin as a true currency, and not an investment vehicle. No cap encourages actual spending and utilization of the currency itself. Stability of price allows future merchants and payment companies to adapt technologies to facilitate adoption of crypto without worrying about losing money in doing so.

I just have a different viewpoint than you. You want a cap to send the value up. Many of us want no cap to encourage use.  The value is irrelevant as 1 Doge = 1 Doge.
The comment that value is irrelevant is non sensible. No currency in the world would make that statement. 

So by that logic, there is no reason invest or purchase any because it is used as a currency currently by merchants
The reason to purchase any is because you think it's neat and want to use it. As all currency, it has value if people believe it has value. If enough people want to use it as currency, then service providers and businesses will start accepting it.
[removed]
I seriously doubt anybody bought bitcoin, because They thought it was neat
Dude.  I have 1.25 million dogecoins. I want it increase in value.  That's all.

Realistically, will doge ever reach 0.50 or $1? I’m kinda new to crypto and just wondering. I understand that the more people but doge, the more it will go in value right? Or I got it all wrong?
You going to moon, right? Pack your bags.
Doesn't matter. 1D = 1D!
why do you think you would be one of the few who managed to actually cash out and dump dogecoin?    
the minute it looks like dogecoin is going to hit anywhere near $1 people will already have their fingers on the trigger to dump it.    
Dogecoin will not stay at that high price long at all.
The honest answer: the cryptocurrency hype has majorly died out after the bubble a couple years ago. It’s not really going anywhere at the moment and cryptocurrency keeps getting a bad rap with it being used in numerous sketchy endevours and hacking things, such as the recent twitter incident. I doubt crypto currency will ever go anywhere overall unless some major event happens or something builds the hype again. As a gamer, I won’t be mad if crypto doesn’t get big again because the prices for graphics cards with everyone trying to buy them for mining was insane.

The meme answer: 1doge = 1doge. To the moon!
As lil wayne would say...the sky is the limit
Probably not. Cryptocurrency in its current form in general suffers one major issue; it cannot be controlled by the government. Considering monetary policy is one of the government's most powerful tools for managing the economy, taking that away is a quick way to get something banned. I wouldn't be surprised if a government-based cryptocurrency is eventually used though. 

Also, even now bitcoin etc are not being propped up mostly by future value, but rather by gamblers who just like playing with get rich quick schemes. I can assure you that the vast majority of bitcoin ""investors"" just want to dump their coin as soon as it hits a good payoff, they aren't holding onto it to use as a currency in the future.

It will not happen overnight, but hey, in the big scheme of things this novel technology is only in its infancy, there are still plenty of opportunities for Dogecoin to show its mettle and prove the naysayers wrong.

Well said. Ive been saying for years dogecoin is a more viable long term currency due to its inflation and microcurrency features.  Nobody is going to pay .000002 bitcoin for a gallon of milk but paying 3 dogecoin for a gallon of milk would be easy to keep track of.
But how? It's a good meme coin i agree. But it has no mining limit like most cryptocurrencies. Inflation causes the price to stay low and unstable.
https://rollercoin.com/?r=k8zdvbbp
But I only have 100,000 doge coin if it doesn’t make it to $80 how am I going to retire?
What I've been doing for awhile now is consistently buying small amounts every paycheck regardless of its usd price.  Doge is a little trickier for me because i have to buy bitcoin first then xfer it to bittrex to trade for dogecoin.  Still I buy between 20 to 40 bucks worth of crypto and then stash it in a paper wallet i keep in a safe deposit box.  Over the years it has seriously added up.  Also only buying small amounts at a time keeps me from worrying about the price."

Always good to shut out criticism. Why have an open mind and make well informed decisions when you can just label all criticism ""hate"" and ignore it?

This is amazing I want the og so I can make cruel memes about my hangry gf

Edit: imaginary, as I am a redditor
I have a friend who can do this. It has to do with some sort of cartilage shape or rigidity, so most people can't do this, hilarious though it may be.
Ha!! Been doing that since I was a kid lol
Glad to see I wasn't the only one

Yup,,https://i.redd.it/smmttj2ldsd51.png,"I'm not ""all in"" on dogecoin but I do have a ridiculous amount of my net worth in doge which I consider a complete memecoin, and I'm ok with that. 

The more I look at money with a ""devil may care"" attitude, the better off and happier I've been in almost every way in my life. 

Money is money, doge is doge. You can hold a million doge or die like a chump imo.
Translation :  When your friends are talking abouti nvestments with viable returns and building wealth, While you're all in on buying bottlecaps
I bought dogecoins, but i can't see them on my wallet (""dogecoin wallet"" on Android) because there are no peers connected.
How can i solve?
It's me!
Dogecoin is one of my best performing assets this year, I'm holding my Doge and buying more when it dips!
this is me
I don't have enough money to buy a bitcoin. I had 1/10th but got rid of it though I am the biggest fanatic of Bitcoin. I am gobbling up as many alt-coins as I can find .02 and below. I proudly started this move with Doge. 

Why you may ask yourself? I looked at the data from parabolic rise of 2018 and all boats (alt-coins) get lifted when Bitcoin goes bananas.
Whats even funnier about this is that considering doge an investment is ""kid who ate glue"" levels of stupid and this looks like a kid who ate glue.
It's me

Hi not ""all in"" on dogecoin but i do have a ridiculous amount of my net worth in a memecoin, and , I'm dad.
You cant be realistic here. They won't hear it. This sub went from doofy jokes to 90s penny stock crazies who think they will one day be millionaries ""if it just goes to 10 cents"".

Where can I find my private key in ""Dogecoin Wallet""? And how can I export it?"

Itll never be at $1. Just live with that fact and have fun with it. You are only going to be miserable if you keep living in a delusion

Can we as a Dogecoin community 
Be a bit more serious and pressure the miner to cap off Dogecoin?
Everyone else is chasing the moon but dodge is looking for mars
Oh ok now I Understand it so it’s value is unto itself
Why are you making the moon sad ?
Miners need to be held accountable as well
Ok thank you
I don’t mean to try anyone’s patience
It’s just a new way of thinking about finances 
Kinda complicated
Oh ok

Oh ok
price predictions 2025 and go!!!
What do you think doge lovers? When will we reach $0.1? $0.5?
Can we as a community please push Dogecoin
To become greater than bitcoin
I just think doge can do it but it is up to us the community
I believe
Ok no[mojtaba](http://DSLFTPSFpXtV5Pac8SZQqEergQcV1sVEeq?amount=111)
We’re on our way today 😮🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: It feels like whenever I post anything y’all dump everything..... anyone else get this vibe?
Ok what does dogecoin need to become like bitcoin?
What does it mean that 1 doge = 1 doge

I’m not understanding
I just don’t understand how these coins differ in value 
Aren’t they all the same 
Sorry I’m just trying to learn this
TO THE MARS
 People say HODL till @Dogecoin reaches $1. I’m HODLING till @elonmusk takes us to the moon lol
The sun is $1000
uncapped dogecoin is what actually gives it an edge against deflationary crypto like btc. Cause you know the gov loves inflationary currency.
A cap is not needed for Dogecoin to be successful.
Doge is looking for doge
No worries!  Don't overcomplicate it. Doge is a CURRENCY.  not a stock, not a fund, etc.  Picture going to the grocery store and buying an apple for 2 Doge.
.5 today because it’s a special day.
Only needs to jump 3300% to get to $0.1!
You're missing the point....again, see 1 Doge = 1 Doge. 

Doge shouldn't be compared to Bitcoin.

Go to r/dogeducation for more info
Dogecoin doesn't need to be like Bitcoin. There's many cryptos like Bitcoin, but only Dogecoin is like Dogecoin.

If you're here looking to become a millionaire then you're misunderstanding what Dogecoin is about. It's literally a meme currency, and no other currency does it better than Dogecoin, as evidenced by the fact that people are still interested in it after six years.

To sum it up, as /u/kaedoge said: 1 Doge is, and always has been, 1 Doge.
I’ll give you a much more real answer then what Kaedoge replies. 

First we need to cap it so it’s limited. Second, we need to advertise it on all media but not as a meme. If we keep posting crap like this one, we won’t get anywhere. This community needs to mature to get more people into it.
It means that 1 Doge should only be compared to the value of itself (1 Doge= 1 Doge), and not some other currency (i.e. USD$, such as 1 Doge = $1) as doge is meant to replace those currencies by which it is being compared.
It’s a saying that doesn’t make any sense, really. Just reading it makes you feel stagnant. What people should be saying is 1 doge = 0.0031 because that’s the actual truth. We want to see numbers. Not gimmicks
Uuhhh... it kinda is tho
Doge is looking to mature more and trying to ditch this meme complex.
i think that fact that’s it not very serious is what gives it its appeal and right now has a very nice and inviting community
What good is a community if it doesn’t have an actual goal or growth? This community needs to mature more of it wants to get anywhere near the moon.
fair enough. i suppose it would be pretty cool if dogecoin was recognized as something worthwhile"
