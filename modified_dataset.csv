Exactly what I love in these and exactly what I would expect from a 60% Bourbon. A burst of darkly sweet fruitiness then it settles into burnt toffee, black liquorice, metallic twang, toasted wood, smooth creamy vanilla, syrupy sweet cherry, zippy peppery spice, sweet corn. It holds onto some of that nicer vanilla and thick caramel richness from the nose, which smooths out the brash and action packed explosion of Four Roses flavor that I always love.","A nice mouth numbing menthol that builds into a super spicy finish, big peppery and cinnamon Bourbon burn with pleasant, syrupy sweet cherry that rides out super long and sweet.",8
New Riff Rye,"It's mellow, sleek and dark. Mellow and minty Rye, spearmint gum, dark burnt caramel, orange, darkly charred and toasted wood. Very nice Rye nose","Some brash Whiskey heat that settles down into hot cinnamon, dark syrupy caramel, black cherry, mellow cool mint, black liquorice, light Rye spice. It's a dark and mellow Rye, kind of closed with not nearly as much bright/spicy Rye flavor as I would like. I think that's just personal preference though.","Some light Rye spice and cool mellow mintiness with plenty of dark and toasted flavor, leaves with hot spirit flavor",5
Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit 10/9/08,"Rich and woody. Deeply toasted and slightly bitter wood, char, black cherry, tobacco, vanilla, earthy and musty fresh wood. That deep, balanced, smooth oakiness that reminds me of older Wild Turkey I've had, although a little more tannic and bitter.","A low simmering black cherry fruitiness with mild spice, tobacco, rich toasted wood, burnt caramel, brash corn sweetness, vanilla. Still plenty of deliciously smooth and balanced Wild Turkey wood but it's also quite fruity and action packed.","Smooth chocolatey wood that surprisingly brightens up into hot cherry, corn sweetness, and nice Bourbon spice. Very fun finish for such a smooth and oaky Bourbon.",7
Brora 35 (2013 release),"Robust yet delicate, a rich and complex nose that unfolds beautifully and doesn't assault you. Rich honey and caramel, wonderful floral notes that aren't perfumy at all, some nice wood funk, beautiful clean vanilla, bright lemon, sugar pastry, waxy and malty, tangy fruit. Really nice richer wood notes that come out with some air, clean toasted wood char and light chocolate. Amazingly balanced and pleasant","My god, this is beautiful. It hits the tongue and just sings. Rich honey and vanilla, wonderful tangy fruit, super thick waxy malt, and it just keeps building richer and brighter. Caramel, clean tangy fruit and pear, sweet pastry, happy sugar barley, a huge waxy and fruity maltiness, sweet vanilla, bright and sweet floral notes. I've never experienced such perfectly executed floral notes in a Scotch, they always seem borderline perfumy and astringent to me. This is like drizzling rich honey and thick, waxy malt on a field of flowers in heaven and then perfectly aging it in a barrel. I feel like I could go on with these cheesy analogies all day lol, Every sip is just so beautiful.","It explodes on the tongue and keeps burning brightly sweet and pleasant long after each sip. Sweet vanilla icing, barley sugar, light pleasant fruitiness, more of of that amazing floral quality. Such a long and pleasant finish.",10

Big herbal rye spice, rich caramel, tons of sharp dill, wintergreen, chocolate, pepper, delicious toasted wood, root beer char, mint","Cool mint and big herbal rye hits first, with a nice peppery spice. I know MGP Rye has a reputation for dill, but they got nothing on this stuff which has tons of very clean and crisp dill. Cinnamon red hot, Rich maple and caramel, fresh wintergreen, fruity cherry, dill, rich toasted wood with delicious char. There's definitely no confusing this stuff with a Bourbon, which is exactly how I like my Rye.","Huge spicy finish. Cinnamon red hots, cherry cough syrup, chocolate, mint, and then delicious dill and peppery rye spice that lingers for a long time.",8
Laphroaig Select,"Maybe a little light, but there's still plenty of Laphroaig goodness on the nose. Big medicinal peat, bandaids, light caramel, barrel char, lemon, vanilla","Sweet and light with very mild smoke, definitely tastes a bit watered down. Light caramel and smoke, smooth wood, lemon, sweet vanilla. It's pretty good, just doesn't offer a lot for someone used to higher ABV or bigger flavor.

Black Maple Hill 23yr Rye,"It smells as dark as it looks! Super rich rasberry and grape like a rich red wine, thick chocolate. Charred wood that is just dark, dark, dark. Those chocolate-orange candies. Burnt motor oil, but in a good way. Undercurrent of super clean herbal Rye spice, melds together with all the rich flavor.","Dark, musty, charred. Much dryer on the mouthfeel than the fruity and rich nose had me expecting. Some pleasant fruitiness that is darkly rich and tart, then huge toasted and tannic wood. A warm, slow simmering kind of menthol-pine Rye, it rides just below the oaky surface. Not spicy or in your face at all. There's a weird kind of plastic flavor that settles down with some time in the glass, almost like a cleaning product.","The weird bleachy plastic rides out here unfortunately, and settles down into a menthol Rye flavor. There's tannic wood and chocolate, rich dark cherry.",7

Wild Turkey 13 Distiller's Reserve,"Woody, duh. Dark toasted oak, new wood, vanilla, caramel, tobacco, chocolate, warm and mellow spice","It's rich, warm, and soft.

Deep toasted oak, warm cherry fruitiness, smooth wood, chocolate rasberry, hot mint","The nose had me ready for a KCSB heat assault, but it's much warmer and softer than expected.

A proper charred and peaty Laphroaig finish, with lots of sweet vanilla.",6

Strong medicinal peat, ocean brine, boggy seaweed, vanilla, must, rich caramel, toasted wood, sweet honey","Sweet caramel and slightly bitter oak, a wave of huge Laphroaig medicinal peat, nice barrel char, vanilla, hint of fruitiness. Like the nose it's just your classic, delicious Laphroaig. It has a slightly soft character though(I was gonna say ""weak,"" but ""soft"" seems more fitting), and there's a little bit of a bitter tannic note in there.","Warm smooth caramel, vanilla, medicinal peat, nice char at the end. Leaves the mouth smoky and numb for ages",7
Four Roses Small Batch,"First thing I notice is the delicious oak here. Beautiful toasted oak and a well balanced sweet richness. Cherry fruitiness, toasted oak, vanilla, burnt caramel, orange zest, menthol and light herbal spice","Against expectations this holds up well on the taste too.

"Clynelish 10yr, Signatory K&L pick","Butterscotch, honey, vanilla, green apple and pear, overall pleasant Bourbon barrel malt notes but with a pretty prominent kind of tart funk. Is this the waxiness everyone always talks about with Clynelish?

Has a thick, BBQ pork and smoke thing going on. Creamy and smoky, like an Octomore. Some nice chocolate and woodiness in there too. I don't think this is cask strength, it drinks really good. I would put it at 50%, it actually drinks like 46-48% but I can't see a Kilchoman release like this being that low.","The wine influence shows up a little more in the finish. It's chocolatey sweet with charred, mouth numbing earthy peat.",8
Signatory Glenlivet 9,"Rich malt with caramel and toffee, green apple that I swear I wasn't looking for but recognized right away. The sherry influence is light and pleasant, some berry sweetness and tart fruit","Big, clean sweetness. The sherry influence is minimal here, it tastes like a malt-bomb. Rich, almost gritty caramel malt, some light and playful fruitiness. More of that lightly tart green apple. Very pleasant.","Finish simply continues on with the delicious, sweet caramel maltiness. It darkens into a burnt, rich caramel fruitiness that is just delicious.",8
Kilchoman Bordeaux single cask,"Very smooth, brooding nose. Earthy peat and thick smoked meat bbq. Slight iodine. Chocolate, rich caramel and vanilla along with dark, syrupy sweetness and a winey twang.","So thick and heavy. Not the harsh, exciting brashness I'm used to with Kilchoman. The presence is just huge in the mouth, like a dark explosion. Big caramel maltiness with sticky sweet dark cherry. Clean peat with rich vanilla. Tart fruit and some slight menthol kick in the background.","A very long, heavy finish. Bright dark cherry sweetness that darkens into caramel and ashy peat. Leaves very sweet and earthy without heavy peatiness.",8
Balblair 21 Blackadder Raw Cask,"Thick, luscious and fruity sherry with no must or sulphury sick sweetness. Warm strawberry and orange, creamy pastry and custard maltiness. The nose is huge, warm, and comforting,and it just smells like dessert.","The warm and fruity creaminess of the nose wakes up and comes alive on the palate. Thick, creamy Balblair maltiness and a slightly bright and bitter kind of berry note that keeps things interesting. Mellows out dark and smooth with warm strawberry and chocolate. It's not huge and heavy or too light and subtle, it just kind of glides along in a creamy, easygoing way.","The flavor suddenly explodes with a bright, sweet tartness and ridiculously thick maltiness that quickly darkens into warm vanilla and chocolate, leaves with a delicious root beer char.",8
Dalmore 12,"Funky and musty right off the bat, not horrible but not totally pleasant either. Once the off-putting notes wear off orange and fruity malt shine through, slight chocolate, some bitter wood.","Funk is still there but not as strong as the nose. I'm guessing it's just a sherry influence which doesn't always work for me. Very weak and watered down flavors of sweet caramel, mild fruitiness and rich wood, some very mild spice.","Not much of a finish to speak of, some sweetness and plain jane caramel",5
A Midwinter Nights Dram 4.4,"The Rye and heavy port finish hit together beautifully. Creamy Rye spice and cinnamon interwoven with silky smooth fruity richness and mildly tart sweet berry. None of it jumps out and smacks you in the face, just glides along soft but huge.","Starts off with toasted wood and rich winey fruit, morphs into bright Rye with brown sugar sweetness and warm baking spices. There's a little bit of toned down Rye dill in there too, but it melds nicely with all the rich flavor. Warm and toasty, it embraces and envelopes me in a way American Whiskey rarely does.","Sweet burnt brown sugar and pepper with Rye baking spice goodness. Leaves you with an elegant, rich sweetness.",7
OFBB 2015,"BIG maple and toffee sweetness with a nice warm maltiness. Coffee with flavored creamer, cherry, also a crisp mintiness.","Darker than the sweet nose. Dark cherry cough syrup, tobacco, charred oak and root beer. Nutty kind of creaminess. It's darkly sweet and light, never feels too huge or heavy though which is nice sometimes.","Sweet char and dark cherry, with some friendly baking spice popping up.",8
Willett Rye 3yr,"Big rich caramel and toffee, crisp minty Rye, candy cherry sweetness, smooth and gritty wood. No hint of dill or anything bitter, just big and warm with that minty Rye twang.","Bright and clear, and totally a Rye. Menthol and rich toffee. A fruity, candy sweetness. Again no trace of dill like the MGP Willett I had, just warm and pleasant with nothing off-putting at all. A tad thin on the mouthfeel though, but it's forgivable with such delicious flavor. Drinks wonderfully at full proof.","Short, but very sweet with warm caramel and mouth numbing menthol",7
Laphroaig Lore,"Standard Laphroaig medicinal peat, this one has extra band-aid though. Sharp minty sweetness and lots of dark ashy char, with smooth vanilla rounding it out nicely.","Beautiful vanilla and caramel richness intertwined with some dark fruity sweetness and musty, swampy peat that doesn't dominate. It just tastes ""dark"" and elegant and mysterious.","Rich vanilla, charred peat, dark sweetness. Leaves behind a kind of dark, chocolatey toasted char. A really nice finish.",7
Old Rip Van Winkle,"Sweet, well rounded, friendly and inviting. Warm orange zest, sweet caramel, smooooth brown sugar, musty wood, herbal mintiness.","Sweet caramel and brown sugar with some nice herbal spice. Like the nose, it's just really friendly and pleasant. It's real ""middle of the road,"" has some sweetness, some spice, some wood, some creaminess, but never hits any of these notes in a real big way. But they all combine nicely making this very well rounded, and it's thoroughly enjoyable at 107 proof.","Very sweet finish with cherry, caramel and some herbal mintiness. Shortish but big and pleasant.",7
Old Particular Laphroaig 16,"Sharp, metallic and medicinal peat. It's big, bold and briny peat that sure hasn't been tempered with age. A lovely tart sweetness too with some honey malt and rich, barrel-charred vanilla","Not as much of a ""peat punch to the face"" as the nose, it's much creamier and sweeter than anticipated. Drinks great at full proof. Big, creamy peat is there with sweet vanilla and gritty charred oak. Medicinal, almost menthol quality that just numbs my mouth in a pleasant way.","Builds and builds sweeter and brighter with creamy vanilla and clean, medicinal peat. It's a long, beautiful finish. Leaves with some ashy wood char that is pretty strong and almost off-putting, but works really well for me overall with the other flavors here.",7
Glenlivet 18,"Quite dry, sweet and malty. Hit first by very musty, funky fruit(like really musty and funky) and clean malt. Rich orange. There's dark and creamy yet delicate sherry notes like dried fruit and bitter chocolate.","This does very well at 43%, it has pretty big flavor and could easily pass for 46-48% for me. It has a ""delicately rich"" mouthfeel, sharp and clean yet dark and rich at the same time. Creamy, sweet dark fruit and chocolate that is very well integrated with the malt, exactly what I love about lightly sherried Scotches. Light toffee and orange. Very faint brine, which was a surprise for me but nice.","Brightens up slightly with some sweet and fruity flavor, but basically pretty even steven with smooth toffee and caramel. Very agreeable.",7
Bruichladdich Valinch 13 (23yr),"Red wine, sweet woodiness. Sharp and tannic with a heavier, creamier backbone of big fruity malt and rich chocolate. The nose kind of lays it all out quickly, not too deep or complex but nice.","Sharp wine-y sherry cuts through quickly then mellows out thickly sweet. More creamy, fruity malt and dark mellow wood with chocolate and very mild spice.","Rich spice-y sweetness and chocolate rise above the darker tannic notes, kind of short though.",7
Hakushu 12,"Fruity with lots of caramel and warm grassy malt. Mintiness and cotton candy sweetness. There's some light smoke I think, that shows up as faint, earthy, rubbery funk, works well with the friendlier fruit and sweet.","Very light earthy smoke that blossoms and opens up fruity and sweet. Sweet caramel and fruity warmth, with lots of pear flavor and some light oak. It's kind of thin at 43%, but it's hard to complain because it's just so gosh darn tasty.","Not a huge finish, it keeps going where the taste left off with sweet caramel and the light, earthy smoke throughout. Fruity warmth lingers.",6
Berry Bros Laphroaig 18,"Classic Laphroaig earthy, medicinal peat. This is actually quite buttery and malty too, with a healthy amount of sweet fruity funk and pepper. Very nice nose.","A big flavorful wave of sharp, medicinal peat intertwined with creamy golden malt, pepper and warm sweetness. It has a straight-forward, creamy mouthfeel that is just so right, not overly bright or huge and heavy. Thick, yet easy drinking. I'm guessing that this is at the lower end of 50%.","Funky peat and peppery warmth builds up big then levels out with creamy/grassy malt, at the end it trails off sweet and peaty.",8
Elijah Craig Barrel Proof # 12 (136 proof),"Big dark cherry oak, big spice and menthol, deep rich caramel. My god, this is just rich and massive. With some water the spice and menthol settles down a little and creamier notes of chocolate cherry emerge along with peppery spice.","Big charred oak, thick and peppery, and dark, dark cherry sweetness. Warm cinnamon, rich tobacco and dark chocolate cocoa. I swear even with water I could chew on this, it's so dark and gritty and thick. The water, instead of just thinning it out, brings out the sweetness and gives it a creamy yet gritty mouthfeel.","Darkly sweet menthol cherry peaks big, then the dark cherry sweetness and rich chocolatey burnt wood hunkers down and settles in for a niiiice long finish, deep dark and heavy.",8
anCnoc 12,"Honey and malt, very reminiscent of fresh baked pastries. Green apple, and some heavier fruity notes. Warm, light, pleasant and inviting.","Sweet and fruity malt, with more light pastry. Warm lemon, green apple. Very light and easygoing, but there's also some medium-rich caramel and fruitiness that gives it a little more weight and keeps it from being too delicate.","The malty sweetness and caramel carries on for a short-ish length finish, leaves me with a bit of a caramel and white chocolate richness.",6
Laphroaig An Cuan Mor,"Bitter oak, dry(dry dry) and musty peat, some sulphury sweet and funky wine. Burnt caramel. This is dry, gnarled, cracked and weathered, but with a creamy and sweet undertone. It's an... interesting nose.","Surprisingly malty and light, big disconnect from the nose. Creamy malt and very slight peat, like a non-islay with mild peat influence a la highland park. The sweet creaminess morphs into burnt or charcoal flavor that comes across as dark, burnt root beer, it's as interesting as it is yummy.","Light, creamy peat that darkens and turns to burnt charcoal and ash. It leaves me with that darkly sweet burnt caramel and root beer.",6
Glenlivet 12,"Grassy malt, nice sweet caramel, pear, a yummy apple twang. I've never noticed in all these years, but I'm picking up some darker vanilla oak notes too. A very mild, pleasant nose.","This has always tasted ""green"" to me, kind of light, malty, and floral, with a healthy dose of sweetness. Fuzzy and grassy malt, this is so malty I love it. Vanilla and sweet caramel. More apple but a little more gentle. Overall it's a more mild, thinner and boring version of the lovely nose.","Sweet caramel and maltiness peaks quickly, not huge or long at all but still pleasant for what it is.",5
Colonel E.H. Taylor Rye,"Creamy, buttery Rye spice, a thick nose. Thick, friendly dill and sour apple sweetness, rounded out with nutty oakiness and rich, leathery brown sugar.","Thick, creamy Rye. Rich, delicious brown sugar and sweet cherries with a hint of clove. Very complex and deep flavor. The mouthfeel is so nice on this, creamy and velvety with lots of wonderful flavors.","Peppery Rye, sweet brown sugar and clove build to a short-ish finish that's a little brighter than than the flavor.",7
"SMWS 54.35, Aberlour 17","Big nose! Super rich caramel and thick, nutty maltiness, I can tell this is my kinda Scotch already. Just enough of a citric zing to keep it interesting. Bold and rich yet dry, musty and fruity, I like this nose.","A little more lively than the nose suggests. Opens with fruity malt that has a tart, jazzy kick. It opens up into rich, creamy caramel and a friendly berry fruitiness. Thick mouthfeel while having a nimble kind of flavor that isn't overbearing, very nice.","Rich caramel with a tasty zing like blueberry syrup that isn't huge or completely mouth-coating, but it rides out and slowly fades nicely, still enjoyable.",7
Glendronach Single Cask 12yr PX 2003,"Deep, rich grape and prune. Smooth chocolate. It's quite woody, with oaky bitterness and baking spices. Lots of tart fruit too. It all melds into a rich, chocolatey, fruity and bitter wave.","Quite acrid, bitter and hot til you add water, much more water than I would normally add. It then becomes a slow and low sherry, thick and rich but not super sweet. I think brooding is the word. Mellow grape, very dry though. Smooooth chocolate. The oaky bitterness is still there but not as intrusive as it was on the nose. More tart, dark fruits.","Kind of a weak medium length finish, but tasty. Smooth, rich, chocolatey wood.",7
Glendronach Single Cask 19yr PX 1995,"First thing that hits me is orangey malt. Not a citric ""zing"" of orange, but rather a warm, friendly, wholesome kind of orange. Very sweet sherry, it's winey and bright(ish) but at the same time musty and dank. Actually it has a sweet Rum kind of smell, only with lots of leather and spice(or, as Ron Burgundy says, ""rich mahogany and leather-bound books""). It's a very light and friendly spiciness, like nutmeg or apple cider on Thanksgiving.","Just...wow. Thick, gritty, and creamy fruitiness, like I can chew on it. That same wholesome orange I got on the nose, actually it's like a rich chocolate orange. Dank and musty wood, figs. There's none of the spice from the nose though, just thick, creamy fruit, like super ripe strawberries and dark cherries.","It peaks quickly, and as bright as this gets(which isn't very, like a flashlight under the covers), then levels out into this sweet yet musty fruitiness that is super thick and in no hurry to go anywhere.",8
Willett Rye 7yr,"Sharp and crisp! Dill, bright orange zest, spicy wood. Loads of rich toffee underlying it all once the initial shock wears off.","Instant zing of flavor, this one's not a subtle creeper at all. Tart dill that comes on even stronger than the nose. Huge, bright Rye spice just explodes in my mouth(giggity). This is so bright, it makes me feel so alive! Sweet cherry and cinnamon, but also warm wood and rich toffee/brown sugar. Very fun and complex, bright sweets dancing around with richer notes, and spicey throughout.","The flavor just keeps building up to this huge explosion of a finish. Long, lingering Rye spice and dill with bright cherry woodiness, that tapers off and leaves you with the richer flavors of brown sugar toffee and vanilla.",8
Balcones Texas Single Malt,"First thing that hits me is cinnamon toast along with strong, yet balanced oak. It's quite malty, but it's a weird kind of dank, maple-y malt. Very fruity and ""fun.""","This drinks great at full proof, I'm hesitant to add water but I add a drop just in case I'm missing anything. Smooth, oaky malt. Still quite sweet and fruity, in a cherry cough syrup kind of way(like the good one, not the bad one!). A very funky, yet interesting flavor pops up, kind of like yummy, burnt root beer.","A nice, spicy finish. Sweet vanilla tempered with that woody root beer funk that really lingers.",7
Weller 12,"Cherry, smooth grain/yeast, a soft woodiness. Light vanilla caramel, and it all combines into this wonderful sweet and creamy butterscotch.","So sweet and smooth. quite complex but nothing overwhelms you. It has a dark cherry oakiness, light fruit, malty and nutty. Creamy and buttery on both the flavor and the mouthfeel. More butterscotch. All these flavors just glide along so smoothly and effortlessly, very pleasant.","That butterscotch goodness just keeps gliding along into the finish. Bright, complex and decent length. Nutty, a little bit of light, friendly spice. Sweet, creamy vanilla oak.",7
"Octomore 10, second limited edition","Huge, dank, and friendly, like Hagrid. This is one thick, oily, Octomore, you can already tell from the nose. Quite oaky, more oak than other Octos I've had, which makes sense with the older age. Big, warm peatiness. Warm, happy fruit. That funky malt is there, but is almost overpowered by this big, bourbon-like chocolate and caramel.","Taste delivers what the nose promised. So thick and oily. That warm, fuzzy peat greets you right away, big yet friendly, and gives way to sweet caramel richness. Oaky again, but not quite as dominant as the nose would suggest, melds beautifully. So chocolatey, I don't think I've ever tasted so much chocolate in a Scotch! And it works so beautifully with that heavy peat.","Just coats your mouth, and it's not so much an explosion of flavor as it is a ""settling."" All the rich, chocolatey caramel and huge peat just meld and coalesce, like your mouth is the home this Scotch has been looking for, and now it's happy and content.",9
