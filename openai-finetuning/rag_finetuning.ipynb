It takes the Documents and splits them up into Nodes, then creates `vector embeddings` of the text of every node. `Vector embedding` aka embedding is a numerical representation of the semantics, or meaning of the text. Two pieces of text with similar meanings will have mathematically similar embeddings, even if the actual text is quite different. This mathematical relationship enables semantic search, where a user provides query terms and LlamaIndex can locate text that is related to the meaning of the query terms rather than simple keyword matching.

given the external data source and a set of queries, we use 2 evaluation metrics from [`ragas` evaluation library](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/tree/main/docs/concepts/metrics). Ragas uses LLMs under the hood to compute the evaluations.\n","\n","The performance of the base model, gpt-3.5-turbo, will be compared with the fine-tuned model.\n","\n","Computation of evaluation metrics require 3 components:\n","1) `Question`: A list of questions that could be asked about my external data/documents, generated using .generate_questions_from_nodes in above fine-tuning step<br>\n","2) `Context`: Retrieved contexts corresponding to each question. The context represents (chunks of) documents that are relevant to the question, i.e. the source from where the answer will be generated.<br>\n","3) `Answer`: Answer generated corresponding to each question from baseline and fine-tuned model.\n","\n","The two metrics are as follow:\n","\n","- `answer_relevancy` - Measures how relevant the generated answer is to the question, where an answer is considered relevant when it <u>directly</u> and <u>appropriately</u> addresses the orginal question, i.e. answers that are complete and do not include unnecessary or duplicated information. The metric does not consider factuality. It is computed using `question` and `answer`, with score ranging between 0 and 1, the higher the score, the better the performance in terms of providing relevant answers. To calculate this score, the LLM is prompted to generate an appropriate question for the generated answer multiple times, and the mean cosine similarity between these generated questions and the original question is measured. The underlying idea is that if the generated answer accurately addresses the initial question, the LLM should be able to generate questions from the answer that align with the original question, i.e. high mean cosine similarity, translating to high score.\n","\n","\n","- `faithfulness` - Measures how factually accurate is the generated answer, i.e. if the response was hallucinated, or based on factuality (from the context). It is computed from `answer` and `context`, with score ranging between 0 and 1, the higher the score, the better the performance in terms of providing contextually accurate information. To calculate this score, the LLM identifies statements within the generated answer and verifies if each statement is supported by the retrieved context. The process then counts the number of statements within the generated answer that can be logically inferred from the context, and dvide by the total number of statements in the answer.\n","\n","Additional note: Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar two items are. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The output value ranges from 0–1 where 0 means no similarity, whereas 1 means that both the items are 100% similar.\n","<br>Hallucinations refer to instances where the language model produces information or claims that are not accurate or supported by the input context.\n","\n","Resources:\n","<br>https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/rag-evaluation-9813a931b3d4\n","<br>https://blog.langchain.dev/evaluating-rag-pipelines-with-ragas-langsmith/\n","<br>https://medium.aiplanet.com/evaluate-rag-pipeline-using-ragas-fbdd8dd466c1"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e10c1798","metadata":{"id":"e10c1798"},"source":["###
